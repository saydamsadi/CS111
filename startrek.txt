\
	On Stardate 43997, Captain Jean-\
	Luc Picard of the Federation \
	Starship Enterprise was kidnapped \

	altered, he was forced to lead \
	an assault on Starfleet at WOLF\

			You don't want to ask me that, \

	An alarm goes off... Kira reacts... presses some panels... \
	moves to a companel... a map of the station comes on the \

	she hits a panel... the monitor changes to a closeup of ODO \
	in the security office. Odo has an unfinished face without \

			You want to watch a Karo-Net \

			Well, we've got a problem.\

			Most people on this colony will\

			"healer"... but her abilities\
			went beyond that. She didn't just\

			because she knew that well-being\

			remedies included words of advice\
			as often as they did medicinal\
			teas...\

			bitter-tasting.\

\
	A large, open living area. The LIVING ROOM is adjacent\
	to a SITTING ROOM... and there are doors to suggest\
	other rooms. There is a stairway leading up to an\
	offscreen second story. The decor should suggest an\
	earlier time and way of life -- a warm Scottish country\
	home from the early 19th century. Herbs and other\
	exotic-looking medicinal ARTIFACTS can be seen\
	throughout the house. And there are a few 24th century\
	devices in evidence -- a replicator, computer terminal,\
	etc.\
\
	Troi is standing at a table, looking at an old-style\
	PHOTOGRAPH of Beverly standing next to an elderly\
	woman. Beverly is standing nearby, looking through\

	to a smile and she bites her lower lip, tensing. The\
	feeling should be very erotic and mesmerizing. Beverly\

11   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS\
\
	where Picard has brought Jason to talk privately.\
	Jason is walking around looking at Picard's things. He\
	stops when he sees Picard's archaeological collection.\
\
					JASON\
			What is all this... ?\
\
					PICARD\
			Archaeological fragments I've\
			collected over the years...\
\
	Picard crosses over and shows him a small stone with\
	hieroglyphics on it.\
\
					PICARD\
				(continuing)\
			This is a Silvan glyph stone...\
\
	He shows him a TBD artifact.\
\
					PICARD\
				(continuing)\
			And this is a Gorlan prayer\
			stick... it's extremely rare...\
\
					JASON\
			Is it valuable... ?\
\
					PICARD\
			Not really. Only to students of\
			archaeology like myself. Still,\
			I had to give up a very old bottle\
			of Saurian brandy for it.\
\
					JASON\
			I'd say you got taken.\
\
					PICARD\
			Perhaps... but I value it\
			nonetheless...\

11   CONTINUED:\
\
					JASON\
			On Camor, something has value if\
			you can eat it or sell it...\
			everything else is a luxury.\
\
	Picard sets down the artifact, uncomfortable, not\
	knowing how to reach out to this defensive young man.\
	After a beat...\
\
					PICARD\
			Would you like some tea?\
\
					JASON\
			No. Thanks.\
\
					PICARD\
			Something else?\
\
	Jason shakes his head, unforthcoming. Picard goes to\
	the replicator.\
\
					PICARD\
			Tea, Earl Grey, hot.\
\
	Neither man talks until we hear the SOUND of the\
	replicator and Picard gets his tea. He turns back to\
	Jason, gamely tries to proceed.\
\
					PICARD\
			Well. I'm sure this whole thing\
			is as much a surprise to you as it\
			is to me...\
\
	Jason gives a small shrug.\
\
					PICARD\
			I'll be honest with you, Jason.\
			I was with your mother for only a\
			short time. I would like to have\
			known her better... but it didn't\
			work out that way.\
\
	This seems to have touched a chord. Jason looks down,\
	gives a small nod.\

\
11   CONTINUED: (2)\
\
					PICARD\
			You look a lot like her -- it's\
			your eyes, I think...\
\
	Again, Jason doesn't reply, though we get the feeling\
	there are a lot of feelings churning inside him.\
\
					PICARD\
				(continuing)\
			I want to be clear about one thing --\
			your mother didn't tell me about\
			you. If she had... I would have\
			been part of your life.\
\
	Jason turns and looks Picard in the eye for maybe the\
	first time in the scene.\
\
					JASON\
			I guess that's not what she\
			wanted.\
\
	There's a moment of awkward silence, then Jason stands.\
\
					JASON\
			I think I'd like to go back to the\
			surface.\
\
					PICARD\
			It would be best if you stayed\
			aboard the Enterprise... until we\
			can resolve the situation with\
			Bok.\
\
					JASON\
			What is the situation with Bok,\
			anyway? Why does he want me dead?\
\
					PICARD\
			Years ago, I was forced to destroy\
			a starship that was under his\
			son's command. Apparently Bok\
			feels it would be fitting\
			vengeance to kill my son.\
\
	Jason absorbs this.\

\
11   CONTINUED: (3)\
\
					JASON\
			I can't hide forever.\
\
					PICARD\
			Of course not. We're trying to\
			locate Bok... I intend to confront\
			him, settle this matter.\
\
					JASON\
			How long will that take?\
\
	There's no real answer to the question.\
\
					PICARD\
			I assure you -- no one's more\
			eager to get this behind us than\
			I am.\
\
	Jason stares at him for a beat, then shrugs.\
\
					JASON\
			Where do I stay?\
\
					PICARD\
			We'll give you quarters.\
\
	Jason grabs his backpack, heads for the door.\
\
					JASON\
			Okay. Let's go.\
\
					PICARD\
			Jason... your being here... I hope\
			it will give us the chance to get\
			to know each other.\
\
	Jason looks away, doesn't respond to the offer of\
	friendship Picard has made. He EXITS, and Picard is\
	left with nothing to do but follow.\

			beam it aboard, but it's not going\
			to be easy to figure out where it\

			Bok took the precaution of\
			encrypting the probe's\

			would be unable to decipher its\
			flight path.\
\
					GEORDI\
			We ran an analysis of the probe's\
			hull -- from the energy signatures\

			looks like it travelled through a\
			Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to\
			an intensive gravimetric\

	Worf works his controls and a grand looking Ferengi\
	APPEARS on the VIEWSCREEN -- DAIMON BIRTA. He's\
	speaking from a Ferengi ship's Bridge, and behind him\
	we see a BANNER that bears his personal crest.\
\
					PICARD\
			Thank you for taking the time to\
			talk to us, Daimon.\
\
					BIRTA\
			I understand you have a problem.\
\
					PICARD\
			Yes, it concerns Daimon Bok.\
\
					BIRTA\
			Bok is no Daimon. He was relieved\
			of command six years ago -- he was\
			unstable, dangerous. We had to\
			confine him to Rog Prison.\
\
					PICARD\
			But he's no longer there?\
\
					BIRTA\
				(matter of fact)\
			He was able to buy himself out\
			about two years ago.\
\
					PICARD\
			Buy himself out?\
\
					BIRTA\
			He paid his debt to society.\
\
	Picard decides not to get into this.\
\
					PICARD\
			Considering that he is dangerous\
			and unstable, I trust you've kept\
			track of him?\
\
					BIRTA\
			He's a private citizen. We take\
			no responsibility for him.\
\
	Picard feels himself growing frustrated.\
\

			I see. Do you have any idea of\

			I understand he was seen in the\
			Dorias cluster not too long ago...\
\
	Picard can't help but frown at the vagueness of this\
	information (behind him, however, Data and Geordi take\
	this information and set to work).\
\
					PICARD\
			That cluster consists of over\
			twenty star systems...\
\
	Birta smiles as if it were nothing.\
\
					BIRTA\
			You don't have to thank me,\
			Captain.\
\
	And with that the VIEWSCREEN returns to a starfield.\
	Geordi turns from the console where he and Data are\
	working.\
\
					GEORDI\
			Believe it or not, sir -- that\
			might've given us the fix we\
			needed. There's a nebula in the\
			Dorias cluster that matches the\
			particle signature we found on the\
			probe.\
\
					DATA\
				(working)\
			There is a class four pulsar three\
			light years from the nebula -- my\
			calculations indicate that the\
			probe was launched in the Xendi\

			What's he like?\
\
	Picard takes a moment, tries to assess the question.\
\

			I'm not sure I can tell you. He's\

\

			It would certainly be\

\
	Beverly ponders this, wants to offer help.\
\

			What I sense about this young\

	enough not to engage in an argument.\
\
					BEVERLY\
			Maybe you're right.\
				(beat)\
			I just think you should consider\

\
	He gives her a questioning look.\

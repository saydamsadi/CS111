\f0\fs24 \cf0 devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.\
This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours\'92 respect, but he gained\'97well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.\
The mother of our particular hobbit\'97what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary\
\
 everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit \'97of Bilbo Baggins, that is\'97was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.\
\
 Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo\'92s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.\
By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed)\'97Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little\
\
 of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.\
All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\
\'93Good Morning!\'94 said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.\
\'93What do you mean?\'94 he said. \'93Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?\'94\
\'93All of them at once,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors,\
\
 into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There\'92s no hurry, we have all the day before us!\'94 Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.\
\'93Very pretty!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it\'92s very difficult to find anyone.\'94\
\'93I should think so\'97in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can\'92t think what anybody sees in them,\'94 said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.\
\'93Good morning!\'94 he said at last. \'93We don\'92t want any adventures here, thank you! You might\
\
 try over The Hill or across The Water.\'94 By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.\
\'93What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won\'92t be good till I move off.\'94\
\'93Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don\'92t think I know your name?\'94\
\'93Yes, yes, my dear sir\'97and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don\'92t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good- morninged by Belladonna Took\'92s son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!\'94\
\'93Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows\'92 sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer\'92s Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all\
\
 evening!\'94 You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. \'93Dear me!\'94 he went on. \'93Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves\'97or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter\'97I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.\'94\
\'93Where else should I be?\'94 said the wizard. \'93All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took\'92s sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for.\'94\
\'93I beg your pardon, I haven\'92t asked for anything!\'94\
\'93Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you\'97and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it.\'94\
\'93Sorry! I don\'92t want any adventures, thank\
\
 you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea\'97any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!\'94 With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards after all are wizards.\
\'93What on earth did I ask him to tea for!\'94 he said to himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.\
Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a while he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit\'92s beautiful green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well.\
The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.\
Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered! He rushed and put on the\
\
 kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.\
\'93I am so sorry to keep you waiting!\'94 he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.\
He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and \'93Dwalin at your service!\'94 he said with a low bow.\
\'93Bilbo Baggins at yours!\'94 said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: \'93I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me.\'94 A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?\
They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.\
\'93Excuse me!\'94 said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.\
\'93So you have got here at last!\'94 That was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very\
\
 old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited.\
\'93I see they have begun to arrive already,\'94 he said when he caught sight of Dwalin\'92s green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and \'93Balin at your service!\'94 he said with his hand on his breast.\
\'93Thank you!\'94 said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he\'97as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful\'97he might have to go without.\
\'93Come along in, and have some tea!\'94 he managed to say after taking a deep breath.\
\'93A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,\'94 said Balin with the white beard. \'93But I don\'92t mind some cake\'97 seed-cake, if you have any.\'94\
\'93Lots!\'94 Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-\
\
 cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.\
When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.\
\'93Gandalf for certain this time,\'94 he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open\'97 Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.\
\'93What can I do for you, my dwarves?\'94 he said.\
\'93Kili at your service!\'94 said the one. \'93And Fili!\'94 added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.\
\'93At yours and your family\'92s!\'94 replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.\
\'93Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,\'94 said Kili. \'93Let us join the throng!\'94\
\'93Throng!\'94 thought Mr. Baggins. \'93I don\'92t like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.\'94 He had only just had a sip\'97in the corner, while the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked\
\
 about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous\'97when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off.\
\'93Someone at the door!\'94 he said, blinking.\
\'93Some four, I should say by the sound,\'94 said Fili. \'93Besides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.\'94\
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, before they were all inside, bowing and saying \'93at your service\'94 one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee,\
\
 and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.\
A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came\'97a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit\'92s beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!\
Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered\'97 this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.\
\'93Carefully! Carefully!\'94 he said. \'93It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!\'94\
\'93At your service!\'94 said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel.\
\
 This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo\'92s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted \'93pray don\'92t mention it,\'94 and stopped frowning.\
\'93Now we are all here!\'94 said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods\'97the best detachable party hoods\'97and his own hat hanging on the pegs. \'93Quite a merry gathering! I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What\'92s that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think for me.\'94\
\'93And for me,\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93And raspberry jam and apple-tart,\'94 said Bifur.\
\'93And mince-pies and cheese,\'94 said Bofur. \'93And pork-pie and salad,\'94 said Bombur. \'93And more cakes\'97and ale\'97and coffee, if\
you don\'92t mind,\'94 called the other dwarves through the door.\
\'93Put on a few eggs, there\'92s a good fellow!\'94 Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. \'93And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!\'94\
\
 \'93Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!\'94 thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.\
\'93Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!\'94 he said aloud. \'93Why don\'92t they come and lend a hand?\'94 Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could sayknife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.\
Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.\
\'93I suppose you will all stay to supper?\'94 he said in his politest unpressing tones.\
\
 \'93Of course!\'94 said Thorin. \'93And after. We shan\'92t get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!\'94\
Thereupon the twelve dwarves\'97not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf\'97jumped to their feet, and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: \'93please be careful!\'94 and \'93please, don\'92t trouble! I can manage.\'94 But the dwarves only started to sing:\
Chip the glasses and crack the plates! Blunt the knives and bend the forks!\
That\'92s what Bilbo Baggins hates\'96 Smash the bottles and burn the corks!\
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! Pour the milk on the pantry floor!\
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! Splash the wine on every door!\
\
 Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl; Pound them up with a thumping pole;\
And when you\'92ve finished, if any are whole,\
Send them down the hall to roll!\
That\'92s what Bilbo Baggins hates!\
So, carefully! carefully with the plates!\
And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went\'97up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin\'92s.\
\
 Then Gandalf\'92s smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard\'92s head. He had a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched\'97he loved smoke-rings\'97and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill.\
\'93Now for some music!\'94 said Thorin. \'93Bring out the instruments!\'94\
Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks. Dwalin and Balin said: \'93Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!\'94 \'93Just bring mine in with you!\'94 said Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin\'92s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit- hole under The Hill.\
The dark came into the room from the little\
\
 window that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flickered\'97it was April\'97and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf\'92s beard wagged against the wall.\
The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep- throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.\
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away ere break of day\
To seek the pale enchanted gold.\
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells\
In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollowhalls beneath the fells.\
\
 For ancient king and elvish lord\
There many a gleaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught\
Tohideingemsonhiltofsword.\
On silver necklaces they strung\
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung The dragon-fire, in twisted wire\
They meshed the light of moon and sun.\
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away, ere break of day, To claim our long-forgotten gold.\
Goblets they carved there for themselves Andharpsofgold;wherenomandelves There lay they long, and many a song Was sung unheard by men or elves.\
The pines were roaring on the height,\
\
 The winds were moaning in the night. The fire was red, it flaming spread; The trees like torches blazed with light.\
The bells were ringing in the dale And men looked up with faces pale; The dragon\'92s ire more fierce than fire Laidlowtheirtowersandhousesfrail.\
The mountain smoked beneath the moon;\
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.\
They fled their hall to dying fall Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.\
Far over the misty mountains grim To dungeons deep and caverns dim We must away, ere break of day,\
To win our harps and gold from him!\
\
 As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up \'97probably somebody lighting a wood-fire\'97 and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.\
He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer-barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.\
\'93Where are you going?\'94 said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both\
\
 halves of the hobbit\'92s mind.\
\'93What about a little light?\'94 said Bilbo\
apologetically.\
\'93We like the dark,\'94 said all the dwarves.\
\'93Dark for dark business! There are many hours before dawn.\'94\
\'93Of course!\'94 said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.\
\'93Hush!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Let Thorin speak!\'94 And this is how Thorin began.\
\'93Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit\'97may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!\'97\'94 He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:\
\'93We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and\
\
 counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation\'97\'94\
This was Thorin\'92s style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn\'92t bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up, knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out \'93struck by lightning, struck by lightning!\'94 over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark\
\
his elbow, and they went back to their dark\
 business.\
\'93Excitable little fellow,\'94 said Gandalf, as they\
sat down again. \'93Gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best\'97as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.\'94\
If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took\'92s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul\'92s head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.\
In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer\'92s gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing- room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: \'93Humph!\'94 (or some snort more or less like that). \'93Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the\
\
than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the\
 sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar!\'94\
Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellowbobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself: \'93Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.\'94\
\'93Pardon me,\'94 he said, \'93if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don\'92t pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing\'94 (this is what he called being on his dignity) \'93that you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my door\'97it was painted a week ago\'97, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a\
\
 great-great-great-grand-uncle once, Bullroarer Took, and\'97\'94\
\'93Yes, yes, but that was long ago,\'94 said Gloin. \'93I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door\'97the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that\'92s how it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It\'92s all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.\'94\
\'93Of course there is a mark,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.\'94\
He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. \'93That\'92s right,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Let\'92s\
\
 have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let\'92s have a little light on this!\'94\
On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.\
\'93This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,\'94 he said in answer to the dwarves\'92 excited questions. \'93It is a plan of the Mountain.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t see that this will help us much,\'94 said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. \'93I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.\'94\
\'93There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,\'94 said Balin, \'93but it will be easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there.\'94\
\'93There is one point that you haven\'92t noticed,\'94 said the wizard, \'93and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes?\
\
 That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.\'94 (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the runes.)\
\'93It may have been secret once,\'94 said Thorin, \'93but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.\'94\
\'93He may\'97but he can\'92t have used it for years and years.\'94\
\'93Why?\'94\
\'93Because it is too small. \'91Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast\'92 say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.\'94\
\'93It seems a great big hole to me,\'94 squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes). He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. \'93How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?\'94 he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.\
  \'93In lots of ways,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93But in what\
\
 way this one has been hidden we don\'92t know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves\'92 method\'97I think that is right, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\'93Quite right,\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93Also,\'94 went on Gandalf, \'93I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is!\'94 he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. \'93Keep it safe!\'94\
\'93Indeed I will,\'94 said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket. \'93Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin\'97.\'94\
\'93A long time before that, if I know anything about the roads East,\'94 interrupted Gandalf.\
\'93We might go from there up along the River Running,\'94 went on Thorin taking no notice, \'93and so to the ruins of Dale\'97the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out\
\
 of it comes the dragon too\'97far too often, unless he has changed his habits.\'94\
\'93That would be no good,\'94 said the wizard, \'93not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply not to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary\'97 especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let\'92s get on and make some plans.\'94\
\'93Very well then,\'94 said Thorin, \'93supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.\'94 He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo.\
\'93First I should like to know a bit more about things,\'94 said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. \'93I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.\'94\
\'93Bless me!\'94 said Thorin, \'93haven\'92t you got a\
\
 map? and didn\'92t you hear our song? and haven\'92t we been talking about all this for hours?\'94\
\'93All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,\'94 said he obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf\'92s recommendation. \'93Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth\'94\'97by which he meant: \'93What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?\'94\
\'93O very well,\'94 said Thorin. \'93Long ago in my grandfather Thror\'92s time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops\'97and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far\
\
 as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather\'92s halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the North.\
\'93Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically for ever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can\'92t make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in\
\
 the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine- trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily\'97a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day) \'97well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors\'97the usual unhappy story, it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and\
\
 passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons\'92 way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don\'92t know for certain, but I don\'92t suppose any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.\
\'93The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off\'94\'97here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck\'97\'93we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug\'97if we\
\
 can.\
\'93I have often wondered about my father\'92s\
and my grandfather\'92s escape. I see now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.\'94\
\'93I did not \'91get hold of it,\'92 I was given it,\'94 said the wizard. \'93Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin.\'94\
\'93Curse his name, yes,\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since\'97\'94\
\'93True, true,\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way for handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked! Here it is,\'94 said he handing the map to Thorin.\
\'93I don\'92t understand,\'94 said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same. The\
  \
 explanation did not seem to explain.\
\'93Your grandfather,\'94 said the wizard slowly\
and grimly, \'93gave the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain. How he got there I don\'92t know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer.\'94\
\'93Whatever were you doing there?\'94 asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves shivered.\
\'93Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.\'94\
\'93We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,\'94 said Thorin; \'93we must give a thought to the Necromancer.\'94\
\'93Don\'92t be absurd! He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for\
\
 you!\'94\
\'93Hear, hear!\'94 said Bilbo, and accidentally\
said it aloud.\
\'93Hear what?\'94 they all said turning suddenly\
towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered \'93Hear what I have got to say!\'94\
\'93What\'92s that?\'94 they asked.\
\'93Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on the door- step long enough, I daresay you will think of something. And well, don\'92t you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good breakfast before you go.\'94\
\'93Before we go, I suppose you mean,\'94 said Thorin. \'93Aren\'92t you the burglar? And isn\'92t sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like six eggs with my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don\'92t break \'92em.\'94\
After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and\
\
 sofas, before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else\'92s wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning.\
As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him:\
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away, ere break of day, To find our long-forgotten gold.\
Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.\
\
 \
 Chapter II\
  \
 ROAST MUTTON\
Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing- gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (\'93but with never a thank-you\'94 he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him.\
\'93Don\'92t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!\'94 he said to himself, \'93thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age!\'94 So he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a\
 \
 nice little second breakfast in the dining-room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf.\
\'93My dear fellow,\'94 said he, \'93whenever are you going to come? What about an early start? \'97and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past ten! They left you the message, because they could not wait.\'94\
\'93What message?\'94 said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.\
\'93Great Elephants!\'94 said Gandalf, \'93you are not at all yourself this morning\'97you have never dusted the mantelpiece!\'94\
\'93What\'92s that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!\'94\
\'93If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,\'94 said Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-paper).\
This is what he read:\
\'93Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event; funeral expenses to be defrayed by us or our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for.\
\'93Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance to make requisite preparations, and shall await your respected person at the Green\
\
 Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11 a.m. sharp. Trusting that you will be punctual,\
\'93 We have the honour to remain \'93 Yoursdeeply\
\'93 Thorin & Co.\'94\
\'93That leaves you just ten minutes. You will\
have to run,\'94 said Gandalf.\
\'93But\'97,\'94 said Bilbo.\
\'93No time for it,\'94 said the wizard.\
\'93But\'97,\'94 said Bilbo again.\
\'93No time for that either! Off you go!\'94\
To the end of his days Bilbo could never\
remember how he found himself outside, without a hat, a walking-stick or any money, or anything that he usually took when he went out; leaving his second breakfast half-finished and quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys into Gandalf\'92s hands, and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on for a mile or more.\
Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had come without a pocket-handkerchief!\
\'93Bravo!\'94 said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him.\
Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village. They were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.\
\'93Up you two get, and off we go!\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93I\'92m awfully sorry,\'94 said Bilbo, \'93but I have\
\
 come without my hat, and I have left my pocket- handkerchief behind, and I haven\'92t got any money. I didn\'92t get your note until after 10.45 to be precise.\'94\
\'93Don\'92t be precise,\'94 said Dwalin, \'93and don\'92t worry! You will have to manage without pocket- handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the journey\'92s end. As for a hat, I have got a spare hood and cloak in my luggage.\'94\
That\'92s how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May, on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark- green hood (a little weather-stained) and a dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have thought of him, I daren\'92t think. His only comfort was he couldn\'92t be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard.\
They had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo\'92s pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along very merrily, and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when they stopped for meals. These didn\'92t come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.\
At first they had passed through hobbit- lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where\
\
 people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone- lands they had been obliged to camp when they could, but at least it had been dry.\
\'93To think it will soon be June!\'94 grumbled Bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. \'93And I\'92m sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags,\'94 thought Bilbo. \'93Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!\'94 It was not the last time that he wished that!\
Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it began to get dark as they went down into a deep valley with a river at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along its banks bent and sighed. Fortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river,\
\
 swollen with the rains, came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north.\
It was nearly night when they had crossed over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a wandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and Thorin muttered something about supper, \'93and where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?\'94\
Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and laughed most. But now he simply was not there at all!\
\'93Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,\'94 groaned Dori and Nori (who shared the hobbit\'92s views about regular meals, plenty and often).\
They decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at it.\
Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the river before they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned,\
\
 and all the baggage that he carried was washed away off him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and less for breakfast.\
There they all sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony- rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look-out man, said: \'93There\'92s a light over there!\'94 There was a hill some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they could now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be a fire or torches twinkling.\
When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some said \'93no\'94 and some said \'93yes\'94. Some said they could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.\
Others said: \'93These parts are none too well known, and are too near the mountains. Travellers seldom come this way now. The old maps are no use: things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded. They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.\'94 Some said: \'93After all there are fourteen of us.\'94 Others said: \'93Where has Gandalf got to?\'94 This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight.\
That settled it. \'93After all we have got a burglar with us,\'94 they said; and so they made\
\
 off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the direction of the light. They came to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the hill they went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and creaking (and a good deal of grumbling and dratting), as they went through the trees in the pitch dark.\
Suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree-trunks not far ahead.\
\'93Now it is the burglar\'92s turn,\'94 they said, meaning Bilbo. \'93You must go on and find out all about that light, and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and canny,\'94 said Thorin to the hobbit. \'93Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is well. If not, come back if you can! If you can\'92t, hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a screech-owl, and we will do what we can.\'94\
Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely quietly. They take a pride in it, and Bilbo had sniffed more than once at what he called \'93all this dwarvish racket,\'94 as they went along, though I don\'92t suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Bilbo walking primly towards the red light, I don\'92t suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it. So, naturally, he got right up to the fire\'97for fire it was\'97without disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw.\
Three very large persons sitting round a\
\
 very large fire of beech-logs. They were toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls. Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great heavy faces of them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing- room fashion at all, at all.\
\'93Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don\'92t look like mutton again tomorrer,\'94 said one of the trolls.\
\'93Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,\'94 said a second. \'93What the \'92ell William was a-thinkin\'92 of to bring us into these parts at all, beats me\'97and the drink runnin\'92 short, what\'92s more,\'94 he said jogging the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug.\
William choked. \'93Shut yer mouth!\'94 he said as soon as he could. \'93Yer can\'92t expect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert. You\'92ve et a village and a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains. How much more d\'92yer want? And time\'92s been up our way, when yer\'92d have said \'91thank yer Bill\'92 for a nice bit o\'92 fat valley mutton like what this is.\'94 He took a big bite off a sheep\'92s leg he was roasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve.\
Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either he should have gone\
\
 back quietly and warned his friends that there were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even pony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A really first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls\'92 pockets\'97it is nearly always worth while, if you can manage it\'97, pinched the very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and walked off without their noticing him. Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it. Then the night could have been spent cheerily.\
Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. He was very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred miles away, and yet\'97and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls\'92 pockets seemed the least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.\
Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William\'92s enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. \'93Ha!\'94 thought he, warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out, \'93this is a beginning!\'94\
It was! Trolls\'92 purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. \'93\'92Ere, \'92oo are you?\'94 it squeaked, as it left the pocket; and William\
\
 turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree.\
\'93Blimey, Bert, look what I\'92ve copped!\'94 said William.\
\'93What is it?\'94 said the others coming up. \'93Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?\'94\
\'93Bilbo Baggins, a bur\'97a hobbit,\'94 said poor\
Bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him.\
\'93A burrahobbit?\'94 said they a bit startled. Trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty suspicious about anything new to them.\
\'93What\'92s a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?\'94 said William.\
\'93And can yer cook \'92em?\'94 said Tom.\
\'93Yer can try,\'94 said Bert, picking up a skewer.\
\'93He wouldn\'92t make above a mouthful,\'94 said William, who had already had a fine supper, \'93not when he was skinned and boned.\'94\
\'93P\'92raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a pie,\'94 said Bert. \'93Here you, are there any more of your sort a- sneakin\'92 in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit,\'94 said he looking at the hobbit\'92s furry feet; and he picked him up by the toes and shook him.\
\'93Yes, lots,\'94 said Bilbo, before he remembered not to give his friends away. \'93No none at all, not one,\'94 he said immediately afterwards.\
\'93What d\'92yer mean?\'94 said Bert, holding him right way up, by the hair this time.\
\'93What I say,\'94 said Bilbo gasping. \'93And please don\'92t cook me, kind sirs! I am a good\
\
 cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean. I\'92ll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won\'92t have me for supper.\'94\
\'93Poor little blighter,\'94 said William. He had already had as much supper as he could hold; also he had had lots of beer. \'93Poor little blighter! Let him go!\'94\
\'93Not till he says what he means by lots and none at all,\'94 said Bert. \'93I don\'92t want to have me throat cut in me sleep! Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!\'94\
\'93I won\'92t have it,\'94 said William. \'93I caught him anyway.\'94\
\'93You\'92re a fat fool, William,\'94 said Bert, \'93as I\'92ve said afore this evening.\'94\
\'93And you\'92re a lout!\'94\
\'93And I won\'92t take that from you, Bill Huggins,\'94 says Bert, and puts his fist in William\'92s eye.\
Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped him on the ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in one another\'92s arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at them both with a branch to bring them to their senses\'97and that of course only made them madder than ever.\
That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left. But his poor little feet had been very squashed in Bert\'92s big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and his head was going\
\
 round; so there he lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight.\
Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a distance, and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light than he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Bill stopped fighting immediately, and \'93a sack, Tom, quick!\'94 they said. Before Balin, who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down.\
\'93There\'92s more to come yet,\'94 said Tom, \'93or I\'92m mighty mistook. Lots and none at all, it is,\'94 said he. \'93No burrahobbits, but lots of these here dwarves. That\'92s about the shape of it!\'94\
\'93I reckon you\'92re right,\'94 said Bert, \'93and we\'92d best get out of the light.\'94\
And so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was down. Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire.\
\'93That\'92ll teach \'92em,\'94 said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought\
\
 like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. Thorin came last\'97and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting mischief, and didn\'92t need to see his friends\'92 legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. He stood outside in the shadows some way off, and said: \'93What\'92s all this trouble? Who has\
been knocking my people about?\'94\
\'93It\'92s trolls!\'94 said Bilbo from behind a tree.\
They had forgotten all about him. \'93They\'92re hiding in the bushes with sacks,\'94 said he.\
\'93O! are they?\'94 said Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before they could leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside. That put him out of the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom\'92s leg\'97as well as he could, it was thick as a young tree-trunk\'97but he was sent spinning up into the top of some bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin\'92s face.\
\
 The Trolls\
\
 Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell you. But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin\'92s head and down to his toes. And so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should hear him.\
It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had just decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later\'97that was Bert\'92s idea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it.\
\'93No good roasting \'92em now, it\'92d take all night,\'94 said a voice. Bert thought it was William\'92s.\
\'93Don\'92t start the argument all over again, Bill,\'94 he said, \'93or it will take all night.\'94\
\'93Who\'92s a-arguing?\'94 said William, who thought it was Bert that had spoken.\
\'93You are,\'94 said Bert.\
\'93You\'92re a liar,\'94 said William; and so the argument began all over again. In the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them. So they got a great black pot, and they took out their knives.\
\'93No good boiling \'92em! We ain\'92t got no\
\
 water, and it\'92s a long way to the well and all,\'94 said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom\'92s.\
\'93Shut up!\'94 said they, \'93or we\'92ll never have done. And yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer say any more.\'94\
\'93Shut up yerself!\'94 said Tom, who thought it was William\'92s voice. \'93Who\'92s arguing but you, I\'92d like to know.\'94\
\'93You\'92re a booby,\'94 said William.\
\'93Booby yerself!\'94 said Tom.\
And so the argument began all over again,\
and went on hotter than ever, until at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them next time.\
\'93Who shall we sit on first?\'94 said the voice.\
\'93Better sit on the last fellow first,\'94 said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin. He thought Tom was talking.\
\'93Don\'92t talk to yerself!\'94 said Tom. \'93But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on him. Which is he?\'94\
\'93The one with the yellow stockings,\'94 said Bert.\
\'93Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings,\'94 said a voice like William\'92s.\
\'93I made sure it was yellow,\'94 said Bert. \'93Yellow it was,\'94 said William.\
\'93Then what did yer say it was grey for?\'94\
said Bert.\
\'93I never did. Tom said it.\'94\
\'93That I never did!\'94 said Tom. \'93It was you.\'94 \'93Two to one, so shut yer mouth!\'94 said Bert. \'93Who are you a-talkin\'92 to?\'94 said William. \'93Now stop it!\'94 said Tom and Bert together.\
\
 \'93The night\'92s gettin\'92 on, and dawn comes early. Let\'92s get on with it!\'94\
\'93Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!\'94 said a voice that sounded like William\'92s. But it wasn\'92t. For just at that moment the light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches. William never spoke for he stood turned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William.\
\'93Excellent!\'94 said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard\'92s voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them.\
The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo\'92s account of what had happened to him twice over, before they were satisfied.\
\'93Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,\'94 said Bombur, \'93when what we wanted was fire and food!\'94\
\'93And that\'92s just what you wouldn\'92t have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,\'94\
\
 said Gandalf. \'93Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don\'92t you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? We must look into it!\'94\
They searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls\'92 stony boots going away through the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave. But they could not open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations.\
\'93Would this be any good?\'94 asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and angry. \'93I found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.\'94 He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone.\
\'93Why on earth didn\'92t you mention it before?\'94 they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back with one big push, and they all went inside. There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls\'97too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims\'97and among them were several swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts.\
Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these;\
\
 and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit.\
\'93These look like good blades,\'94 said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them curiously. \'93They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them.\'94\
\'93Let\'92s get out of this horrible smell!\'94 said Fili. So they carried out the pots of coins, and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By that time they felt like breakfast, and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls\'92 larder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire.\
After that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; and they did nothing more till the afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, just in case they ever had the chance to come back and recover them. When that was done, they all mounted once more, and jogged along again on the path towards the East.\
\'93Where did you go to, if I may ask?\'94 said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along.\
\'93To look ahead,\'94 said he.\
\'93And what brought you back in the nick of time?\'94\
\
 \'93Looking behind,\'94 said he.\
\'93Exactly!\'94 said Thorin; \'93but could you be more plain?\'94\
\'93I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell.\'94\
\'93Where\'92s that?\'94 asked Bilbo.\
\'93Don\'92t interrupt!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93You will get there in a few days now, if we\'92re lucky, and find out all about it. As I was saying I met two of Elrond\'92s people. They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls. It was they who told me that three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road: they had frightened everyone away from the district, and they waylaid strangers.\
\'93I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance and made for it. So now you know. Please be more careful, next time, or we shall never get anywhere!\'94\
\'93Thank you!\'94 said Thorin.\
\
 \
 Chapter III\
  \
 A SHORT REST\
 They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them. Already they seemed only a day\'92s easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark and drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders the tips of snow-peaks gleamed.\
\
 \'93Is that The Mountain?\'94 asked Bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked so big before.\
\'93Of course not!\'94 said Balin. \'93That is only the beginning of the Misty Mountains, and we have got to get through, or over, or under those somehow, before we can come into Wilderland beyond. And it is a deal of a way even from the other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East where Smaug lies on our treasure.\'94\
\'93O!\'94 said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling before. He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle singing. Not for the last time!\
Now Gandalf led the way. \'93We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,\'94 he said. \'93We need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety\'97also it is very necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you ever get back at all).\'94\
They asked him where he was making for,\
\
 and he answered: \'93You are come to the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely House. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.\'94\
That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. There seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in front of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the nearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be.\
Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign of any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now that the house might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water at the bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep with waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither\
\
 jump over nor climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to look at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a pack on its back would never have come out again.\
It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white stones, some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.\
His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and they followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light became very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo\'92s pony began to stumble over roots and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so suddenly that Gandalf\'92s horse nearly slipped down the slope.\
\'93Here it is at last!\'94 he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear\
\
 the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley-side across the water.\
Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as they got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony\'92s neck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech and oak, and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had almost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream.\
\'93Hmmm! it smells like elves!\'94 thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. They were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like laughter in the trees:\
O! What are you doing, And where are you going? Your ponies need shoeing! The river is flowing!\
O! tra-la-la-lally\
here down in the valley!\
\
 O! What are you seeking, And where are you making? The faggots are reeking, The bannocks are baking!\
O! tril-lil-lil-lolly\
the valley is jolly,\
ha! ha!\
O! Where are you going With beards all a-wagging? Noknowing,noknowing What brings Mister Baggins\
And Balin and Dwalin down into the valley\
in June ha! ha!\
O! Will you be staying, Or will you be flying? Your ponies are straying! The daylight is dying!\
\
 To fly would be folly, To stay would be jolly And listen and hark\
Till the end of the dark to our tune\
ha! ha!\
So they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not that they would care; they would only laugh all the more if you told them so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little frightened of them too. Dwarves don\'92t get on well with them. Even decent enough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at them, and most of all at their beards.\
\'93Well, well!\'94 said a voice. \'93Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn\'92t it delicious!\'94\
\'93Most astonishing wonderful!\'94\
Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin.\
\
 \'93Welcome to the valley!\'94 he said.\
\'93Thank you!\'94 said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse and among the elves, talking merrily with them.\
\'93You are a little out of your way,\'94 said the elf: \'93that is, if you are making for the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, but you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing over there,\'94 he said. \'93I can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.\'94\
Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to know his names and all about him, although he had never seen them before. He thought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and are wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of the land, as quick as water flows, or quicker.\
But the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would not stay. On they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good path and so at last to the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily,\
\
 as mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the snow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and careful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went across.\
\'93Don\'92t dip your beard in the foam, father!\'94 they cried to Thorin, who was bent almost on to his hands and knees. \'93It is long enough without watering it.\'94\
\'93Mind Bilbo doesn\'92t eat all the cakes!\'94 they called. \'93He is too fat to get through key-holes yet!\'94\
\'93Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!\'94 said Gandalf, who came last. \'93Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!\'94\
And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors flung wide.\
Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating,\
\
 and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever\'97 even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay.\
The master of the house was an elf-friend\'97 one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.\
He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He comes into many tales, but his part in the story of Bilbo\'92s great adventure is only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. His house was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into that valley.\
\
 I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that they heard in that house. All of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. Their clothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes. Their plans were improved with the best advice. So the time came to midsummer eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on midsummer morning.\
Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day he looked at the swords they had brought from the trolls\'92 lair, and he said: \'93These are not troll-make. They are old swords, very old swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin. They were made in Gondolin for the Goblin- wars. They must have come from a dragon\'92s hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin- cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!\'94\
\'93Whence did the trolls get them, I wonder?\'94 said Thorin looking at his sword with new interest.\
\
 \'93I could not say,\'94 said Elrond, \'93but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war.\'94\
Thorin pondered these words. \'93I will keep this sword in honour,\'94 he said. \'93May it soon cleave goblins once again!\'94\
\'93A wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!\'94 said Elrond. \'93But show me now your map!\'94\
He took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks of the bright River Running. The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent. He held up the map and the white light shone through it. \'93What is this?\'94 he said. \'93There are moon-letters here, beside the plain runes which say \'91five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.\'92\'94\
\'93What are moon-letters?\'94 asked the hobbit full of excitement. He loved maps, as I have told you before; and he also liked runes and letters\
\
 and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.\
\'93Moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them,\'94 said Elrond, \'93not when you look straight at them. They can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written. The dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. These must have been written on a midsummer\'92s eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago.\'94\
\'93What do they say?\'94 asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance before, and there would not have been another until goodness knows when.\
\'93Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks,\'94 read Elrond, \'93and the setting sun with the last light of Durin\'92s Day will shine upon the key-hole.\'94\
\'93Durin, Durin!\'94 said Thorin. \'93He was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his heir.\'94\
\'93Then what is Durin\'92s Day?\'94 asked Elrond. \'93The first day of the dwarves\'92 New Year,\'94\
  \
 said Thorin, \'93is as all should know the first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it Durin\'92s Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky together. But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come again.\'94\
\'93That remains to be seen,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Is there any more writing?\'94\
\'93None to be seen by this moon,\'94 said Elrond, and he gave the map back to Thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummer\'92s eve.\
The next morning was a midsummer\'92s morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more adventure, and with a knowledge of the road they must follow over the Misty Mountains to the land beyond.\
\

 Chapter IV\
  \
 OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL\
 There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.\
Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind, they were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below. Far, far away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own country of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He shivered. It was getting bitter cold up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon\
\
 the snow, and passed among them (which was lucky), or over their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to dislike being broken\'97 except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stone.\
\'93The summer is getting on down below,\'94 thought Bilbo, \'93and haymaking is going on and picnics. They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this rate.\'94 And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last moon of Autumn\'97\'93and perhaps it will be Durin\'92s Day\'94 they had said. Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that way for many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the Wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of\
\
 the Wild; and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.\
He knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm \'97more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light.\
Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the lightning-flashes, he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling rocks at one another for a game, and catching them, and tossing them\
\
 down into the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all. Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were whinnying with fright. They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides.\
\'93This won\'92t do at all!\'94 said Thorin. \'93If we don\'92t get blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football.\'94\
\
 \
 The Mountain-path\
\'93Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!\'94 said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself.\
The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. So it proved on this occasion.\
Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind. \'93We have found a dry cave,\'94 they said, \'93not far round the next corner; and ponies and all could get inside.\'94\
\'93Have you thoroughly explored it?\'94 said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains were seldom unoccupied.\
\'93Yes, yes!\'94 they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long about it; they had come back too quick. \'93It isn\'92t all that big, and it does not go far back.\'94\
That, of course, is the dangerous part about\
\
 caves: you don\'92t know how far they go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kili\'92s news seemed good enough. So they all got up and prepared to move. The wind was howling and the thunder still growling, and they had a business getting themselves and their ponies along. Still it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand\'97as he did that day in Bilbo\'92s dining- room that seemed so long ago, if you remember\'97, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end.\
It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf would not hear of it. So they spread out their wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets\
\
 comfortable, got out their pipes and blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them. They talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his share of the treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they used the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them.\
It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with them, after all. For, somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider and wider, and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look. Then he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping\'97 beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to.\
At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies\'92 tails disappearing into it. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size.\
\
 Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo\'92s yell had done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead.\
The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the dwarves and hurried them along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices; and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again and again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. Not for the last time.\
Now there came a glimmer of a red light\
\
 before them. The goblins began to sing, or croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as well.\
Clap! Snap! the black crack! Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!\
And down down to Goblin-town\
You go, my lad!\
Clash, crash! Crush, smash!\
Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground!\
Ho, ho! my lad!\
Swish, smack! Whip crack!\
Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,\
While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, Round and round far underground\
Below,mylad!\
It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash! and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The\
\
 general meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them with aswish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they could in front of them; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern.\
It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.\
I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves. The goblins chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a line, and dragged them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row.\
\
 There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad- hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. But they had a special grudge against Thorin\'92s people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don\'92t care who they catch, as long as it\
\
 is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend themselves.\
\'93Who are these miserable persons?\'94 said the Great Goblin.\
\'93Dwarves, and this!\'94 said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo\'92s chain so that he fell forward onto his knees. \'93We found them sheltering in our Front Porch.\'94\
\'93What do you mean by it?\'94 said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. \'93Up to no good, I\'92ll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn\'92t be surprised to learn! Murderers and friends of Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to say?\'94\
\'93Thorin the dwarf at your service!\'94 he replied\'97it was merely a polite nothing. \'93Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We sheltered from a storm in what seemed a convenient cave and unused; nothing was further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever.\'94 That was true enough!\
\'93Um!\'94 said the Great Goblin. \'93So you say! Might I ask what you were doing up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and where you were going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not that it will do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your folk already; but let\'92s have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for you!\'94\
\
 \'93We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces, and first, second, and third cousins, and the other descendants of our grandfathers, who live on the East side of these truly hospitable mountains,\'94 said Thorin, not quite knowing what to say all at once in a moment, when obviously the exact truth would not do at all.\
\'93He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!\'94 said one of the drivers. \'93Several of our people were struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; and they are as dead as stones. Also he has not explained this!\'94 He held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the Trolls\'92 lair.\
The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the sword at once. It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. They had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.\
\'93Murderers and elf-friends!\'94 the Great Goblin shouted. \'93Slash them! Beat them! Bite them! Gnash them! Take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see the light again!\'94 He was in such a rage that he jumped off his seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open.\
\
 Just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins.\
The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would not have compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.\
Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness.\
The sword went back into its sheath. \'93Follow me quick!\'94 said a voice fierce and quiet; and before Bilbo understood what had happened he was trotting along again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down more dark passages with the yells of the goblin- hall growing fainter behind him. A pale light was leading them on.\
\'93Quicker, quicker!\'94 said the voice. \'93The torches will soon be relit.\'94\
\
 \'93Half a minute!\'94 said Dori, who was at the back next to Bilbo, and a decent fellow. He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands, and then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, and many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with. Not for a long while did they stop, and by that time they must have been right down in the very mountain\'92s heart.\
Then Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then they were too busy to ask how he got there. He took out his sword again, and again it flashed in the dark by itself. It burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins were about; now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible. This sword\'92s name was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you remember. The goblins just called it Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for Gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great deal for friends in a tight corner.\
\'93Are we all here?\'94 said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. \'93Let me see: one\'97that\'92s Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili\
\
 and Kili? Here they are! twelve, thirteen\'97and here\'92s Mr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might be worse, and then again it might be a good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of angry goblins just behind! On we go!\'94\
On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast \'97for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have to\'97they took it in turn to carry him on their backs.\
Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. Soon they could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired.\
\'93Why, O why did I ever leave my hobbit- hole!\'94 said poor Mr. Baggins bumping up and down on Bombur\'92s back.\
\'93Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!\'94 said poor Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat\
\
 and terror.\
At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin\
with him. They turned a sharp corner. \'93About turn!\'94 he shouted. \'93Draw your sword Thorin!\'94\
There was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. They came scurrying round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin- cleaver, and Foe-hammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes. The ones in front dropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The ones behind yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after them. \'93Biter and Beater!\'94 they shrieked; and soon they were all in confusion, and most of them were hustling back the way they had come.\
It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that corner. By that time the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins\'92 realm. When the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise than bats.\
That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them coming. Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help the dwarves as they went along.\
\
 Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind in the dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders into the blackness, bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more.\
\
 \
 Chapter V\
  \
 RIDDLES IN THE DARK\
 When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor.\
Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did\
\
 not seem of any particular use at the moment. He did not go much further, but sat down on the cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He thought of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home\'97for he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler.\
He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why he had been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him; or even why his head was so sore. The truth was he had been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while.\
After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. Then he felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible place. Still at the moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his little sword\'97the little dagger that he\
\
 got from the trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches.\
Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his eyes. \'93So it is an elvish blade, too,\'94 he thought; \'93and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough.\'94\
But somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed that such weapons made a great impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly.\
\'93Go back?\'94 he thought. \'93No good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do! On we go!\'94 So up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter.\
Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are\
\
 more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their sense of direction underground\'97not when their heads have recovered from being bumped. Also they can move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.\
I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins\'92 place, all the same. The tunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or two. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he took no notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional whirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.\
Suddenly without any warning he trotted\
\
 splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know whether it was just a pool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage, or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword was hardly shining at all. He stopped, and he could hear, when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound.\
\'93So it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river,\'94 he thought. Still he did not dare to wade out into the darkness. He could not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water. There are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also there are other things more slimy than fish. Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with passages, and\
\
 the original owners are still there in odd corners, slinking and nosing about.\
Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don\'92t know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum\'97as dark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and deep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he grabbed with his long fingers as quick as thinking. He liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when he could get it; but he took care they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if they ever came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling about. They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come on the lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they found they could go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to go that way\'97unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither\
\
 goblin nor fish came back.\
Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of\
rock in the middle of the lake. He was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all.\
Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was sitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed:\
\'93Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it\'92s a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel it\'92d make us, gollum!\'94 And when he said gollum he made a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name, though he always called himself \'91my precious\'92.\
The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.\
\'93Who are you?\'94 he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him.\
\'93What iss he, my preciouss?\'94 whispered Gollum (who always spoke to himself through never having anyone else to speak to). This is what he had come to find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and\
\
 whispered afterwards.\
\'93I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the\
dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don\'92t know where I am; and I don\'92t want to know, if only I can get away.\'94\
\'93What\'92s he got in his handses?\'94 said Gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite like.\
\'93A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!\'94\
\'93Sssss\'94 said Gollum, and became quite polite. \'93Praps ye sits here and chats with it a bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it does, does it?\'94 He was anxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out more about the sword and the hobbit, whether he was quite alone really, whether he was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really hungry. Riddles were all he could think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept down, down, into the dark under the mountains.\
\'93Very well,\'94 said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a\
\
 friend of the goblins.\
\'93You ask first,\'94 he said, because he had not\
had time to think of a riddle. So Gollum hissed:\
What has roots as nobody sees, Is taller than trees,\
Up, up it goes,\
And yet never grows?\
\'93Easy!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93Mountain, I suppose.\'94\
\'93Does it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If precious asks, and it doesn\'92t answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and we doesn\'92t answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way out, yes!\'94\
\'93All right!\'94 said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think of riddles that could save him from being eaten.\
Thirty white horses on a red hill, First they champ,\
Then they stamp, Then they stand still.\
\
 That was all he could think of to ask\'97the idea of eating was rather on his mind. It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do.\
\'93Chestnuts, chestnuts,\'94 he hissed. \'93Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!\'94 Then he asked his second:\
Voiceless it cries, Wingless flutters, Toothless bites, Mouthless mutters.\
\'93Half a moment!\'94 cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before, and getting his wits back he thought of the answer. \'93Wind, wind of course,\'94 he said, and he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot. \'93This\'92ll puzzle the nasty little underground creature,\'94 he thought:\
An eye in a blue face Sawan eye in a green face. \'93That eye is like to this eye\'94 Said the first eye,\
\
 \'93But in lowplace Not in high place.\'94\
\'93Ss, ss, ss,\'94 said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a river, \'93Sss, sss, my preciouss,\'94 he said. \'93Sun on the daisies it means, it does.\'94\
But these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him. Also they reminded him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so this time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant:\
It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. It lies behind stars and under hills,\
And empty holes it fills.\
It comes first and follows after,\
Ends life, kills laughter.\
\
 Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the answer was all round him any way. \'93Dark!\'94 he said without even scratching his head or putting on his thinking cap.\
A box without hinges, key, or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid,\
he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. This he thought a dreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; he whispered and spluttered.\
After some while Bilbo became impatient. \'93Well, what is it?\'94 he said. \'93The answer\'92s not a kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from the noise you are making.\'94\
\'93Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss\'97ss\'97ss.\'94\
\'93Well,\'94 said Bilbo after giving him a long chance, \'93what about your guess?\'94\
But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting under the river\
\
 bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck\'97\'93Eggses!\'94 he hissed. \'93Eggses it is!\'94 Then he asked:\
Alive without breath,\
As cold as death;\
Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking.\
He also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because he was always thinking of the answer. But he could not remember anything better at the moment, he was so flustered by the egg-question. All the same it was a poser for poor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if he could help it. I imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since you are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten to disturb your thinking. Bilbo sat and cleared his throat once or twice, but no answer came.\
After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: \'93Is it nice, my preciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?\'94 He began to peer at Bilbo out of the darkness.\
\'93Half a moment,\'94 said the hobbit shivering.\
\
 \'93I gave you a good long chance just now.\'94\
\'93It must make haste, haste!\'94 said Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a\
fright and fell on Bilbo\'92s toes.\
\'93Ugh!\'94 he said, \'93it is cold and clammy!\'94\'97\
and so he guessed. \'93Fish! fish!\'94 he cried. \'93It is fish!\'94\
Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever he could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.\
No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some.\
It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum might have had some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another time. As it was, talking of fish, \'93no-legs\'94 was not so very difficult, and after that the rest was easy. \'93Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones\'94 that of course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave it. Then he thought the time had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what he said:\
This thing all things devours:\
\
 Birds, beasts, trees, flowers; Gnaws iron, bites steel; Grinds hard stones to meal; Slays king, ruins town,\
And beats high mountain down.\
Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these things. He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he ought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat. He flapped into the water and paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him. His tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; he wanted to shout out: \'93Give me more time! Give me time!\'94 But all that came out with a sudden squeal was:\
\'93Time! Time!\'94\
Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.\
Gollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also tired of the game. It had made him very hungry indeed. This\
\
 time he did not go back to the boat. He sat down in the dark by Bilbo. That made the hobbit most dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits.\
\'93It\'92s got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst one more question to guess, yes, yess,\'94 said Gollum.\
But Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting next to him, and pawing and poking him. He scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he could not think of anything.\
\'93Ask us! ask us!\'94 said Gollum.\
Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his pocket with his other hand. There he found the ring he had picked up in the passage and forgotten about.\
\'93What have I got in my pocket?\'94 he said aloud. He was talking to himself, but Gollum thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset.\
\'93Not fair! not fair!\'94 he hissed. \'93It isn\'92t fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it\'92s got in its nassty little pocketses?\'94\
Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his question, \'93What have I got in my pocket?\'94 he said louder.\
\
 \'93S-s-s-s-s,\'94 hissed Gollum. \'93It must give us three guesseses, my preciouss, three guesseses.\'94\
\'93Very well! Guess away!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93Handses!\'94 said Gollum.\
\'93Wrong,\'94 said Bilbo, who had luckily just\
taken his hand out again. \'93Guess again!\'94 \'93S-s-s-s-s,\'94 said Gollum more upset than ever. He thought of all the things he kept in his own pockets: fish-bones, goblins\'92 teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think what other people kept in their\
pockets.\
\'93Knife!\'94 he said at last.\
\'93Wrong!\'94 said Bilbo, who had lost his some\
time ago. \'93Last guess!\'94\
Now Gollum was in a much worse state\
than when Bilbo had asked him the egg- question. He hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his last guess.\
\'93Come on!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I am waiting!\'94 He tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not feel at all sure how the game was going to end, whether Gollum guessed right or not.\
\'93Time\'92s up!\'94 he said.\
\
 \'93String, or nothing!\'94 shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair\'97working in two guesses at once.\
\'93Both wrong,\'94 cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put his back to the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. He knew, of course, that the riddle- game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it. But he felt he could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient laws.\
But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could see the sword in Bilbo\'92s hand. He sat still, shivering and whispering. At last Bilbo could wait no longer.\
\'93Well?\'94 he said. \'93What about your promise? I want to go. You must show me the way.\'94\
\'93Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh no! gollum!\'94\
\'93Never you mind,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93A promise is a promise.\'94\
\'93Cross it is, impatient, precious,\'94 hissed Gollum. \'93But it must wait, yes it must. We can\'92t\
\
 go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get some things first, yes, things to help us.\'94\
\'93Well, hurry up!\'94 said Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? But he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry now and hungry. And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan.\
Not far away was his island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring.\
\'93My birthday-present!\'94 he whispered to himself, as he had often done in the endless dark days. \'93That\'92s what we wants now, yes; we wants it!\'94\
He wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on your finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen, and then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint.\
\'93My birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious.\'94 So he had always said to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present, ages ago in the old days when\
\
 such rings were still at large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to look at it. And still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any longer, or when he was very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would see him, no one would notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat. Only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something softer.\
\'93Quite safe, yes,\'94 he whispered to himself. \'93It won\'92t see us, will it, my precious? No. It won\'92t see us, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite.\'94\
That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo\'92s side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark. Bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a while; for he had no idea how\
\
 to find his way out alone.\
Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a\
shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He was on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain.\
\'93Where iss it? Where iss it?\'94 Bilbo heard him crying. \'93Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!\'94\
\'93What\'92s the matter?\'94 Bilbo called. \'93What have you lost?\'94\
\'93It mustn\'92t ask us,\'94 shrieked Gollum. \'93Not its business, no, gollum! It\'92s losst, gollum, gollum, gollum.\'94\
\'93Well, so am I,\'94 cried Bilbo, \'93and I want to get unlost. And I won the game, and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your looking!\'94 Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be something good. \'93Come along!\'94 he shouted.\
\'93No, not yet, precious!\'94 Gollum answered. \'93We must search for it, it\'92s lost, gollum.\'94\
\'93But you never guessed my last question, and you promised,\'94 said Bilbo.\
\'93Never guessed!\'94 said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss.\
\
 \'93What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first.\'94\
As far as Bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not tell. Gollum\'92s mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had brooded for ages on this one thing, and he was always afraid of its being stolen. But Bilbo was annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. \'93Answers were to be guessed not given,\'94 he said.\
\'93But it wasn\'92t a fair question,\'94 said Gollum. \'93Not a riddle, precious, no.\'94\
\'93Oh well, if it\'92s a matter of ordinary questions,\'94 Bilbo replied, \'93then I asked one first. What have you lost? Tell me that!\'94\
\'93What has it got in its pocketses?\'94 The sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small points of light peering at him. As suspicion grew in Gollum\'92s mind, the light of his eyes burned with a pale flame.\
\'93What have you lost?\'94 Bilbo persisted.\
But now the light in Gollum\'92s eyes had become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for him.\
\
 Bilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw that all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he turned and ran blindly back up the dark passage down which he had come, keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand.\
\'93What has it got in its pocketses?\'94 he heard the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as Gollum leapt from his boat. \'93What have I, I wonder?\'94 he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. He put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger.\
The hiss was close behind him. He turned now and saw Gollum\'92s eyes like small green lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to run faster, but suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword under him.\
In a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing and whispering as he ran.\
What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light of his eyes palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got up, and sheathed his sword, which was now\
\
 glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down to Gollum\'92s water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of escape without meaning to.\
\'93Curse it! curse it! curse it!\'94 hissed Gollum. \'93Curse the Baggins! It\'92s gone! What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He\'92s found it, yes he must have. My birthday-present.\'94\
Bilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last beginning to guess himself. He hurried a little, getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, who was still going quickly, not looking back, but turning his head from side to side, as Bilbo could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.\
\'93My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that\'92s it. When we came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker. That\'92s it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! It\'92s gone, gollum.\'94\
Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel-wall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed to be having an argument with himself.\
\
 \'93It\'92s no good going back there to search, no. We doesn\'92t remember all the places we\'92ve visited. And it\'92s no use. The Baggins has got it in its pocketses; the nassty noser has found it, we says.\'94\
\'93We guesses, precious, only guesses. We can\'92t know till we find the nassty creature and squeezes it. But it doesn\'92t know what the present can do, does it? It\'92ll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn\'92t know, and it can\'92t go far. It\'92s lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn\'92t know the way out. It said so.\'94\
\'93It said so, yes; but it\'92s tricksy. It doesn\'92t say what it means. It won\'92t say what it\'92s got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. It\'92s off to the back-door. To the back-door, that\'92s it.\'94\
\'93The goblinses will catch it then. It can\'92t get out that way, precious.\'94\
\'93Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it\'92s got the present, our precious present, then goblinses will get it, gollum! They\'92ll find it, they\'92ll find out what it does. We shan\'92t ever be safe again, never, gollum! One of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see him. He\'92ll be there but not seen. Not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he\'92ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!\'94\
\'93Then let\'92s stop talking, precious, and make\
\
 haste. If the Baggins has gone that way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!\'94\
With a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo hurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you invisible! He had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that he really had found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a yard to one side.\
On they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind going as softly as a hobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo had noticed on the way down, side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began at once to count them.\
\'93One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes, yes.\'94 And so on and on.\
As the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he was leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid. Goblins might be about, and he had lost his ring. At last he stopped by a low opening, on their left as they went up.\
\
 \'93Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!\'94 he whispered. \'93This is it. This is the way to the back-door, yes. Here\'92s the passage!\'94\
He peered in, and shrank back. \'93But we dursn\'92t go in, precious, no we dursn\'92t. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!\'94\
\'93What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here, precious, wait a bit and see.\'94\
So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after all, but Bilbo could not get in! There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the opening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from side to side between his knees.\
Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but menacingly. He could not see the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had other senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed to be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor, and his head thrust out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring.\
\
 Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He must get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength left. He must fight. He must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to kill him. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now. Gollum had no sword. Gollum had not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he was miserable, alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo\'92s heart: a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in another flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped.\
No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum\'92s head he jumped, seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he only just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage.\
Gollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. All at\
\
 once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo\'92s heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as an echo, but menacing, the voice came behind:\
\'93Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!\'94\
Then there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. \'93If goblins are so near that he smelt them,\'94 he thought, \'93then they\'92ll have heard his shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things.\'94\
The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. \'93A bit low for goblins, at least for the big ones,\'94 thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the orcs of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.\
Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a while it climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at last the slope stopped, the passage turned a corner and dipped down again, and there, at\
\
 the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering round another corner\'97a glimpse of light. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of- doors sort of light. Then Bilbo began to run.\
Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open.\
Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for anything.\
They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was an accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on his finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.\
A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum\'92s misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The goblins stopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled twice\
\
 as loud as before, but not so delightedly. \'93Where is it?\'94 they cried.\
\'93Go back up the passage!\'94 some shouted. \'93This way!\'94 some yelled. \'93That way!\'94 others\
yelled.\
\'93Look out for the door,\'94 bellowed the\
captain.\
Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords\
rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. There was a terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance.\
Bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had happened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, and so get out of the way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by feel.\
\'93I must get to the door, I must get to the door!\'94 he kept on saying to himself, but it was a long time before he ventured to try. Then it was like a horrible game of blind-man\'92s-buff. The place was full of goblins running about, and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a goblin who could not make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.\
It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it\
\
 nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he could not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge of the door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: there were a few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came out from behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the door\'97but he could not get through.\
Suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: \'93There is a shadow by the door. Something is outside!\'94\
Bilbo\'92s heart jumped into his mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass buttons on the doorstep.\
Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the trees. But they don\'92t like the sun: it makes their legs wobble and their heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and keeping out of the sun; so soon they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had escaped.\

 Chapter VI\
  \
 OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE\
  Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink westwards\'97behind the mountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo\'92s path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees.\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 he exclaimed. \'93I seem to have got right to the other side of the Misty Mountains, right to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where and O where can Gandalf and the dwarves have got to? I only hope to goodness they are not still back there in the power of the goblins!\'94\
He still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable\
\
 thought was growing inside him. He wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. He had just made up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back\'97and very miserable he felt about it\'97when he heard voices.\
He stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of these dells under the bushes people were talking.\
He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head with a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He could have clapped and shouted for joy, but he did not. He had still got the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking straight at him without noticing him.\
\'93I will give them all a surprise,\'94 he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and Gandalf was saying that they could not possibly go on with\
\
 their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him.\
\'93After all he is my friend,\'94 said the wizard, \'93and not a bad little chap. I feel responsible for him. I wish to goodness you had not lost him.\'94\
The dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could not stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not chosen someone with more sense. \'93He has been more trouble than use so far,\'94 said one. \'93If we have got to go back now into those abominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him, I say.\'94\
Gandalf answered angrily: \'93I brought him, and I don\'92t bring things that are of no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for, Dori?\'94\
\'93You would have dropped him,\'94 said Dori, \'93if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your legs from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!\'94\
\'93Then why didn\'92t you pick him up again?\'94\
\'93Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling over bodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my head with Glamdring, and Thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere\
\
 with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw the goblins running back yelping. You shouted \'91follow me everybody!\'92 and everybody ought to have followed. We thought everybody had. There was no time to count, as you know quite well, till we had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the lower door, and helter-skelter down here. And here we are\'97without the burglar, confusticate him!\'94\
\'93And here\'92s the burglar!\'94 said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping off the ring.\
Bless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight. Gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let people walk right into them like that without warning. It is a fact that Bilbo\'92s reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If they had still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf\'92s words, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it was a very clever bit of work.\
Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and said nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he said: \'93Oh, just crept along, you know\'97very carefully and quietly.\'94\
\
 \'93Well, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and quietly under my very nose and not been spotted,\'94 said Balin, \'93and I take off my hood to you.\'94 Which he did.\
\'93Balin at your service,\'94 said he.\
\'93Your servant, Mr. Baggins,\'94 said Bilbo. Then they wanted to know all about his\
adventures after they had lost him, and he sat down and told them everything\'97except about the finding of the ring (\'93not just now\'94 he thought). They were particularly interested in the riddle- competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum.\
\'93And then I couldn\'92t think of any other question with him sitting beside me,\'94 ended Bilbo; \'93so I said \'91what\'92s in my pocket?\'92 And he couldn\'92t guess in three goes. So I said: \'91what about your promise? Show me the way out!\'92 But he came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the dark. Then I followed him, because I heard him talking to himself. He thought I really knew the way out, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in the entrance, and I could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate.\'94\
\'93What about the guards?\'94 they asked. \'93Weren\'92t there any?\'94\
\'93O yes! lots of them; but I dodged \'92em. I got stuck in the door, which was only open a crack, and I lost lots of buttons,\'94 he said sadly looking\
\
 at his torn clothes. \'93But I squeezed through all right\'97and here I am.\'94\
The dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging guards, jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or very alarming.\
\'93What did I tell you?\'94 said Gandalf laughing. \'93Mr. Baggins has more about him than you guess.\'94 He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out.\
Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.\
The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up going that way, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now.\
\'93I must see if I can\'92t find a more or less\
\
 decent giant to block it up again,\'94 said Gandalf, \'93or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all.\'94\
As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo\'92s yell he realized what had happened. In the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the shadows.\
\'93A very ticklish business, it was,\'94 he said. \'93Touch and go!\'94\
But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took\'92s midsummer-eve parties, as you remember). The rest we all know\'97except that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right direction.\
\'93They made that gate ages ago,\'94 he said, \'93partly for a way of escape, if they needed one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do great damage. They guard it always and no one has ever managed to block it up. They will guard it\
\
 doubly after this,\'94 he laughed.\
All the others laughed too. After all they had\
lost a good deal, but they had killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all escaped, so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.\
But the wizard called them to their senses. \'93We must be getting on at once, now we are a little rested,\'94 he said. \'93They will be out after us in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are lengthening. They can smell our footsteps for hours and hours after we have passed. We must be miles on before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by.\'94\
\'93O yes!\'94 he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit. \'93You lose track of time inside goblin-tunnels. Today\'92s Thursday, and it was Monday night or Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and miles, and come right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on the other side\'97quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which our pass would have brought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty high up. Let\'92s get on!\'94\
\'93I am dreadfully hungry,\'94 groaned Bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal since the night before the night before last. Just\
\
 think of that for a hobbit! His stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was over.\
\'93Can\'92t help it,\'94 said Gandalf, \'93unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage.\'94\
\'93No thank you!\'94 said Bilbo.\
\'93Very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on\'97or we shall be made into supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves.\'94\
As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its bank, but it was not much good.\
They still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the long grasses between the boulders, the patches of rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all vanished, and they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a landslide. When they began to go down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled away from their feet; soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces below them slithering and rolling; then\
\
 lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off, crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before long the whole slope above them and below them seemed on the move, and they were sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs and stones.\
It was the trees at the bottom that saved them. They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below.\
\'93Well! that has got us on a bit,\'94 said Gandalf; \'93and even goblins tracking us will have a job to come down here quietly.\'94\
\'93I daresay,\'94 grumbled Bombur; \'93but they won\'92t find it difficult to send stones bouncing down on our heads.\'94 The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet.\
\'93Nonsense! We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. We must be quick! Look at the light!\'94\
\
 The sun had long gone behind the mountains. Already the shadows were deepening about them, though far away through the trees and over the black tops of those growing lower down they could still see the evening lights on the plains beyond. They limped along now as fast as they were able down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards. At times they were pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit\'92s head; at times they were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine- needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea- sighing into the branches of the trees.\
\'93Must we go any further?\'94 asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin\'92s beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves\'92 breathing like a loud noise. \'93My toes are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.\'94\
\'93A bit further,\'94 said Gandalf.\
After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. The moon was up and was shining into the clearing. Somehow it struck all of them as not at\
\
 all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to see.\
All of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. It was answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then by another not far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the moon, wolves gathering together!\
There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins\'92 hole at home, but he knew that noise. He had had it described to him often enough in tales. One of his elder cousins (on the Took side), who had been a great traveller, used to imitate it to frighten him. To hear it out in the forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo. Even magic rings are not much use against wolves\'97especially against the evil packs that lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you!\
\'93What shall we do, what shall we do!\'94 he cried. \'93Escaping goblins to be caught by wolves!\'94 he said, and it became a proverb, though we now say \'93out of the frying-pan into the fire\'94 in the same sort of uncomfortable situations.\
\'93Up the trees quick!\'94 cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or\
\
 were slender enough to swarm up. They found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust the branches. You would have laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were more comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which they could not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out.\
And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it.\
\'93You\'92ve left the burglar behind again!\'94 said Nori to Dori looking down.\
\'93I can\'92t be always carrying burglars on my back,\'94 said Dori, \'93down tunnels and up trees!\
\
 What do you think I am? A porter?\'94\
\'93He\'92ll be eaten if we don\'92t do something,\'94\
said Thorin, for there were howls all round them now, getting nearer and nearer. \'93Dori!\'94 he called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest tree, \'93be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!\'94\
Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not reach his hand even when he climbed down to the bottom branch and hung his arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back.\
Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Bilbo down. He waited till he had clambered off his shoulders into the branches, and then he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped at his cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole pack of them yelping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out.\
But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named) cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe. Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves\
\
 all round below waiting for you, they can be perfectly miserable places.\
This glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves. More and more kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then went snuffling about till they had smelt out every tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the middle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the dreadful language of the Wargs. Gandalf understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree.\
I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The Wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far from their mountains, unless they are driven out and are looking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I am glad to say has not happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to help and shared the\
\
 plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. The Wargs had come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting.\
In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from the South, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. There were many of them, and they were brave and well-armed, and even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. But now they had planned with the goblins\'92 help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. If their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to their caves.\
This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their wives and children, but also because of the danger which now threatened Gandalf and his friends. The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very meeting-place. They\
\
 thought they were friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans down into the valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no intention of going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down.\
Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All the same he was not going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He gathered the huge pine-cones from the branches of the tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one in blue flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and\
\
 smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, and then rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright.\
The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to see, and the commotion they made filled all the forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into them, and unless they rolled over quick they were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the glade wolves were rolling over and over to put out the sparks on their backs, while those that were burning were running about howling and setting others alight, till their own friends chased them away and they fled off down the slopes crying and yammering and looking for water.\
\'93What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?\'94 said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting, black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains. \'93I hear wolves\'92 voices! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods?\'94\
He swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at either hand leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the\
\
 Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at a great distance. The Lord of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could not see the people in the trees, he could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping come up faint from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from their gate and wound into the wood.\
Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud and strong and noble- hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When they took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such creatures), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves, and stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated the eagles and feared them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the mountains.\
Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they\
\
 flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.\
A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine- needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.\
Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.\
Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all\
\
 the flames were put out\'97but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo\'92s eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.\
He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song:\
Fifteen birds in five fir-trees,\
their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!\
But, funny little birds, they had no wings! O what shall we do with the funny little things?\
Roast \'92em alive, or stewthem in a pot;\
fry them, boil them and eat them hot?\
Then they stopped and shouted out: \'93Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your\
\
 nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don\'92t you sing?\'94\
\'93Go away! little boys!\'94 shouted Gandalf in answer. \'93It isn\'92t bird-nesting time. Also naughty little boys that play with fire get punished.\'94 He said it to make them angry, and to show them he was not frightened of them\'97though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing.\
Burn, burn tree and fern!\
Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch To light the night for our delight,\
Ya hey!\
Bake and toast \'92em, fry and roast \'92em! till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;\
till hair smells and skins crack,\
fat melts, and bones black\
in cinders lie beneath the sky!\
So dwarves shall die,\
and light the night for our delight, Ya hey!\
Ya-harri-hey! Ya hoy!\
And with thatYa hoy! the flames were under Gandalf\'92s tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower\
\
 branches cracked.\
Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree.\
The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.\
Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.\
There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.\
Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori\'92s legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up\
\
 they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.\
Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battleground. The flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches. They went up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo had escaped only just in time!\
Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they were high up in the sky, rising all the time in strong sweeping circles. Bilbo never forgot that flight, clinging onto Dori\'92s ankles. He moaned \'93my arms, my arms!\'94; but Dori groaned \'93my poor legs, my poor legs!\'94\
At the best of times heights made Bilbo giddy. He used to turn queer if he looked over the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had to escape from wolves before). So you can imagine how his head swam now, when he looked down between his dangling toes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him, touched here and there with the light of the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains.\
The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking\
\
 out of black shadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold. He shut his eyes and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would happen if he did not. He felt sick.\
The flight ended only just in time for him, just before his arms gave way. He loosed Dori\'92s ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagle\'92s eyrie. There he lay without speaking, and his thoughts were a mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side. He was feeling very queer indeed in his head by this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three days with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself saying aloud: \'93Now I know what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!\'94\
\'93No you don\'92t!\'94 he heard Dori answering, \'93because the bacon knows that it will get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan\'92t. Also eagles aren\'92t forks!\'94\
\'93O no! Not a bit like storks\'97forks, I mean,\'94 said Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at the eagle who was perched close by. He wondered what other nonsense he had been saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are only the size of a hobbit, and are up in his eyrie at night!\
\
 The eagle only sharpened his beak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and took no notice.\
Soon another eagle flew up. \'93The Lord of the Eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to the Great Shelf,\'94 he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in his claws and flew away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all alone. He had just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by \'91prisoners,\'92 and to begin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit, when his own turn came.\
The eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. This time he flew only a short way. Very soon Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side. There was no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by jumping over a precipice. There he found all the others sitting with their backs to the mountain wall. The Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf.\
It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the eagle-lord appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound. So you see \'91prisoners\'92 had meant \'91prisoners rescued\
\
 from the goblins\'92 only, and not captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized that at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful mountains. He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle for carrying the dwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their journey across the plains below.\
\
 \
 The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate\
The Lord of the Eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. \'93They would shoot at us with their great bows of yew,\'94 he said, \'93for they would think we were after their sheep. And at other times they would be right. No! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains.\'94\
\'93Very well,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Take us where and as far as you will! We are already deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished with hunger.\'94\
\'93I am nearly dead of it,\'94 said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard.\
\'93That can perhaps be mended,\'94 said the Lord of the Eagles.\
Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The eagles had brought up dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep. The dwarves managed all the preparations. Bilbo was too weak to help, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used to having it delivered by the butcher\
\
 all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.)\
So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains. Soon Bilbo\'92s stomach was feeling full and comfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly, though really he would have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat toasted on sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his own house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something that he could not find nor remember what it looked like.\

 Chapter VII\
  \
 QUEER LODGINGS\
 The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the time and to go and put his kettle on\'97and found he was not home at all. So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start.\
This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle\'92s back and cling between his wings. The air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The dwarves were crying farewells and promising to repay the Lord of the Eagles if ever they could, as off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain\'92s side. The sun was still close to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the valleys and hollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the birds were already high\
\
 up and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling back behind them into the distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.\
\'93Don\'92t pinch!\'94 said his eagle. \'93You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look rather like one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than flying?\'94\
Bilbo would have liked to say: \'93A warm bath and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;\'94 but he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to let go his clutch just a tiny bit.\
After a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for, even from their great height, for they began to go down circling round in great spirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and below them were trees that looked like oaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants.\
Quickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set down their passengers.\
\'93Farewell!\'94 they cried, \'93wherever you fare,\
\
 till your eyries receive you at the journey\'92s end!\'94 That is the polite thing to say among eagles.\
\'93May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks,\'94 answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.\
And so they parted. And though the Lord of the Eagles became in after days the King of All Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them again\'97except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as that comes in at the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.\
There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with many steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond the stream. There was a little cave (a wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of the stony ford. Here the party gathered and discussed what was to be done.\
\'93I always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains,\'94 said the wizard, \'93and now by good management and good luck I have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on it again before it is all over, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing\
\
 business to attend to.\'94\
The dwarves groaned and looked most\
distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to think Gandalf was going to come all the way and would always be there to help them out of difficulties. \'93I am not going to disappear this very instant,\'94 said he. \'93I can give you a day or two more. Probably I can help you out of your present plight, and I need a little help myself. We have no food, and no baggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don\'92t know where you are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles north of the path which we should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry. Very few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way, which is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far away. That Somebody made the steps on the great rock\'97the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here often, certainly not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go and find him; and if all goes well at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles \'91farewell wherever you fare!\'92 \'94\
They begged him not to leave them. They offered him dragon-gold and silver and jewels, but he would not change his mind. \'93We shall see, we shall see!\'94 he said, \'93and I think I have\
\
 earned already some of your dragon-gold\'97 when you have got it.\'94\
After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall elms.\
\'93And why is it called the Carrock?\'94 asked Bilbo as he went along at the wizard\'92s side.\
\'93He called it the Carrock, because carrock is his word for it. He calls things like that carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because it is the only one near his home and he knows it well.\'94\
\'93Who calls it? Who knows it?\'94\
\'93The Somebody I spoke of\'97a very great person. You must all be very polite when I introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think; and you must be careful not to annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. He can be appalling when he is angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. Still I warn you\
\
 he gets angry easily.\'94\
The dwarves all gathered round when they\
heard the wizard talking like this to Bilbo. \'93Is that the person you are taking us to now?\'94 they asked. \'93Couldn\'92t you find someone more easy- tempered? Hadn\'92t you better explain it all a bit clearer?\'94\'97and so on.\
\'93Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very carefully,\'94 answered the wizard crossly. \'93If you must know more, his name is Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin- changer.\'94\
\'93What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn\'92t turn their skins into squirrels?\'94 asked Bilbo.\
\'93Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Don\'92t be a fool Mr. Baggins if you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don\'92t mention the word furrier again as long as you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He is a skin-changer. He changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that ought to be enough. Some say that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended\
\
 from the first men who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world, and before the goblins came into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is the true tale. He is not the sort of person to ask questions of.\
\'93At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-wood and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as himself. They work for him and talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard him growl in the tongue of bears: \'91The day will come when they will perish and I shall go back!\'92 That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself.\'94\
Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more questions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale they plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have\
\
 eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground.\
It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of flowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had been planted. Especially there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of short white sweet honey-smelling clover. There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air. Bees were busy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them.\
\'93If one was to sting me,\'94 he thought, \'93I should swell up as big again as I am!\'94\
They were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold.\
\'93We are getting near,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93We are on the edge of his bee-pastures.\'94\
After a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn- hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble.\
\'93You had better wait here,\'94 said the wizard to the dwarves; \'93and when I call or whistle begin to come after me\'97you will see the way I go\'97\
\
 but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes between each pair of you. Bombur is fattest and will do for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate somewhere round this way.\'94 And with that he went off along the hedge taking the frightened hobbit with him.\
They soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which they could see gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings, some thatched and made of unshaped logs: barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden house. Inside on the southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives with bell- shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and out filled all the air.\
The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went down a wide track towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the grass and looked at them intently with very intelligent faces; then off they galloped to the buildings.\
\'93They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers,\'94 said Gandalf.\
Soon they reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the wooden house and its two long wings. In the middle there was lying a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches\
\
 beside it. Standing near was a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. He was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe. The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.\
\'93Ugh! here they are!\'94 he said to the horses. \'93They don\'92t look dangerous. You can be off!\'94 He laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came forward.\
\'93Who are you and what do you want?\'94 he asked gruffly, standing in front of them and towering tall above Gandalf. As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted through his legs without ducking his head to miss the fringe of the man\'92s brown tunic.\
\'93I am Gandalf,\'94 said the wizard.\
\'93Never heard of him,\'94 growled the man. \'93And what\'92s this little fellow?\'94 he said, stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black eyebrows.\
\'93That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation,\'94 said Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious of his many missing buttons. \'93I am a wizard,\'94 continued Gandalf. \'93I have heard of you, if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?\'94\
\
 \'93Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to see him now and again,\'94 said Beorn. \'93Well, now I know who you are, or who you say you are. What do you want?\'94\
\'93To tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say we have had rather a bad time with goblins in the mountains.\'94\
\'93Goblins?\'94 said the big man less gruffly. \'93O ho, so you\'92ve been having trouble withthem have you? What did you go near them for?\'94\
\'93We did not mean to. They surprised us at night in a pass which we had to cross; we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countries\'97it is a long tale.\'94\
\'93Then you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won\'92t take all day,\'94 said the man leading the way through a dark door that opened out of the courtyard into the house.\
Following him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. Though it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was rising to the blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening in the roof. They passed through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and\
\
 was still warm and filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the steps.\
\
  Here they sat on wooden benches while Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo swung his dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden, wondering what their names could be, as he had never seen half of them before.\
\'93I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two. . .\'94 said the wizard.\
\'93Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that,\'94 said Beorn.\
\'93Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may.\'94\
\'93Go on, call away!\'94\
So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them.\
\'93One or three you meant, I see!\'94 said Beorn. \'93But these aren\'92t hobbits, they are dwarves!\'94\
\'93Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori at your service!\'94 said the two dwarves bowing again.\
\'93I don\'92t need your service, thank you,\'94 said\
\
 Beorn, \'93but I expect you need mine. I am not over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief in my lands\'97what are you up to, by the way?\'94\
\'93They are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood,\'94 put in Gandalf, \'93and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. We were crossing by the High Pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were attacked by the evil goblins\'97as I was about to tell you.\'94\
\'93Go on telling, then!\'94 said Beorn, who was never very polite.\
\'93There was a terrible storm; the stone- giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of our companions. . .\'94\
\'93Do you call two several?\'94\
\'93Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two.\'94\
\'93Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?\'94\
\'93Well, no. They don\'92t seem all to have come when I whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain.\'94\
\
 \'93Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won\'92t make much difference,\'94 growled Beorn.\
Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had stopped, for, if you remember, Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes.\
\'93Hullo!\'94 said Beorn. \'93You came pretty quick \'97where were you hiding? Come on my jack-in- the-boxes!\'94\
\'93Nori at your service, Ori at. . .\'94 they began; but Beorn interrupted them.\
\'93Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let\'92s get on with this tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended.\'94\
\'93As soon as we were asleep,\'94 went on Gandalf, \'93a crack at the back of the cave opened; goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies \'97\'94\
\'93Troop of ponies? What were you\'97a travelling circus? Or were you carrying lots of goods? Or do you always call six a troop?\'94\
\'93O no! As a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six of us\'97and well, here are two more!\'94 Just at that moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. The big man was frowning at first, but they did their best to be frightfully polite, and kept on\
\
 nodding and bending and bowing and waving their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf- fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into a chuckling laugh: they looked so comical.\
\'93Troop, was right,\'94 he said. \'93A fine comic one. Come in my merry men, and what are your names? I don\'92t want your service just now, only your names; and then sit down and stop wagging!\'94\
\'93Balin and Dwalin,\'94 they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking rather surprised.\
\'93Now go on again!\'94 said Beorn to the wizard.\
\'93Where was I? O yes\'97I was not grabbed. I killed a goblin or two with a flash\'97\'94\
\'93Good!\'94 growled Beorn. \'93It is some good being a wizard, then.\'94\
\'93\'97and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into the main hall, which was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I thought to myself \'91even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do against so many?\'94\'92\
\'93A dozen! That\'92s the first time I\'92ve heard eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some more jacks that haven\'92t yet come out of their boxes?\'94\
\'93Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more\
\
 here now\'97Fili and Kili, I believe,\'94 said Gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing.\
\'93That\'92s enough!\'94 said Beorn. \'93Sit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!\'94\
So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of the lower gate, and their horror when they found that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. \'93We counted ourselves and found that there was no hobbit. There were only fourteen of us left!\'94\
\'93Fourteen! That\'92s the first time I\'92ve heard one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or else you haven\'92t told me yet all the names of your party.\'94\
\'93Well, of course you haven\'92t seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you.\'94\
\'93O let \'92em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count differently to other people. But now please get on with the tale.\'94 Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very interested. You see, in the old days he had known the very part of the mountains that Gandalf was describing. He nodded and he\
\
 growled, when he heard of the hobbit\'92s reappearance and of their scramble down the stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods.\
When Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and strode about and muttered: \'93I wish I had been there! I would have given them more than fireworks!\'94\
\'93Well,\'94 said Gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good impression, \'93I did the best I could. There we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered us. They yelled with delight and sang songs making fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees . . .\'94\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 growled Beorn. \'93Don\'92t pretend that goblins can\'92t count. They can. Twelve isn\'92t fifteen and they know it.\'94\
\'93And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as well. I haven\'92t ventured to introduce them before, but here they are.\'94\
In came Bifur and Bofur. \'93And me!\'94 gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He was fat, and also angry at being left till last. He refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately after the other two.\
\'93Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that is all that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we\
\
 can finish this story without any more interruptions.\'94 Mr. Baggins saw then how clever Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the story, and the story had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. He never invited people into his house, if he could help it. He had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in his porch!\
By the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles\'92 rescue and of how they had all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty Mountains and the shadows were long in Beorn\'92s garden.\
\'93A very good tale!\'94 said he. \'93The best I have heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell such a good one, they might find me kinder. You may be making it all up, of course, but you deserve a supper for the story all the same. Let\'92s have something to eat!\'94\
\'93Yes please!\'94 they all said together. \'93Thank you very much!\'94\
Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful\
\
 white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk. They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the fire.\
Then baa\'97baa\'97baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by a large coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn\'92s big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him. What did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The\
\
 other ponies came in rolling round drum- shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so soon they were all seated at Beorn\'92s table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year.\
There they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left the Last Homely House in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains, and especially of the dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day\'92s ride before them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.\
The dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to pass before they came to the dragon\'92s stronghold. When dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no things of gold or silver in his hall,\
\
 and few save the knives were made of metal at all.\
They sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead. The dark night came on outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built with fresh logs and the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the dancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind them, and dark at the top like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or not, it seemed to Bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls. Soon he began to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start.\
The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves were sitting cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and presently they began to sing. Some of the verses were like this, but there were many more, and their singing went on for a long while:\
The wind was on the withered heath, but in the forest stirred no leaf:\
there shadows lay by night and day, and dark things silent crept beneath.\
\
 The wind came down from mountains cold,\
and like a tide it roared and rolled;\
the branches groaned, the forest moaned, and leaves were laid upon the mould.\
The wind went on from West to East; all movement in the forest ceased, but shrill and harsh across the marsh its whistling voices were released.\
The grasses hissed, their tassels bent, the reeds were rattling\'97on it went\
o\'92er shaken pool under heavens cool where racing clouds were torn and rent.\
It passed the lonely Mountain bare and swept above the dragon\'92s lair: there black and dark lay boulders stark and flying smoke was in the air.\
\
 It left the world and took its flight\
over the wide seas of the night.\
The moon set sail upon the gale,\
and stars were fanned to leaping light.\
Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up stood Gandalf.\
\'93It is time for us to sleep,\'94 he said, \'93\'97for us, but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn said before he left us: you must not stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril.\'94\
Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall. For him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon, which was peering down through the smoke- hole in the roof.\
There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if he\
\
 would come in as a bear and kill them. He dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his fears.\
It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo opened his eyes.\
\'93Get up lazybones,\'94 he said, \'93or there will be no breakfast left for you.\'94\
Up jumped Bilbo. \'93Breakfast!\'94 he cried. \'93Where is breakfast?\'94\
\'93Mostly inside us,\'94 answered the other dwarves who were moving about the hall; \'93but what is left is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon as we went out.\'94\
\'93Where is Gandalf?\'94 asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he could.\
\'93O! out and about somewhere,\'94 they told him. But he saw no sign of the wizard all that day until the evening. Just before sunset he walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the dwarves were having supper, waited on by\
\
 Beorn\'92s wonderful animals, as they had been all day. Of Beorn they had seen and heard nothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled.\
\'93Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?\'94 they all cried.\
\'93One question at a time\'97and none till after supper! I haven\'92t had a bite since breakfast.\'94\
At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and jug\'97he had eaten two whole loaves (with masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a quart of mead\'97and he took out his pipe. \'93I will answer the second question first,\'94 he said, \'93\'97but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!\'94 Indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke rings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing them into all sorts of different shapes and colours, and setting them at last chasing one another out of the hole in the roof. They must have looked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure-eights, and going off like a flock of birds into the distance.\
\'93I have been picking out bear-tracks,\'94 he said at last. \'93There must have been a regular bears\'92 meeting outside here last night. I soon\
\
 saw that Beorn could not have made them all: there were far too many of them, and they were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In that direction only one set of footprints led\'97none coming, only ones going away from here. I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock for me to cross. It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the night before last. And now I think I have answered your first question, too,\'94 ended Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent.\
Bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. \'93What shall we do,\'94 he cried, \'93if he leads all the Wargs and the goblins down here? We\
\
 shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said he was not a friend of theirs.\'94\
\'93So I did. And don\'92t be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy.\'94\
The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the courtyard. Then he woke up when everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before.\
Next morning they were all wakened by Beorn himself. \'93So here you all are still!\'94 he said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: \'93Not eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see\'94; and he poked Mr. Baggins\'92 waistcoat most disrespectfully. \'93Little bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey,\'94 he chuckled. \'93Come and have some more!\'94\
So they all went to breakfast with him. Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to them, for he told them himself. He had been over the river and\
\
 right back up into the mountains\'97from which you can guess that he could travel quickly, in bear\'92s shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf- glade he had soon found out that part of their story was true; but he had found more than that: he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also because of the burning of the chief wolf\'92s nose and the death from the wizard\'92s fire of many of his chief servants. So much they told him when he forced them, but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them.\
\'93It was a good story, that of yours,\'94 said Beorn, \'93but I like it still better now I am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly\
\
 of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the Great Goblin!\'94 he chuckled fiercely to himself.\
\'93What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?\'94 asked Bilbo suddenly.\
\'93Come and see!\'94 said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A goblin\'92s head was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy. But now he was their friend, and Gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole story and the reason of their journey, so that they could get the most help he could offer.\
This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of them, and a horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry\'97nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little of which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need to carry this side of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the road. \'93But your way through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and difficult,\'94 he said.\
\
 \'93Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be past and gone indeed before you get to the other side), and nuts are about all that grows there fit for food; in there the wild things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with skins for carrying water, and I will give you some bows and arrows. But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. That you should neither drink of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that place I don\'92t think you will shoot anything, wholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason.\
\'93That is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you much; you must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I send with you. At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come back this way again.\'94\
They thanked him, of course, with many bows\
\
 and sweepings of their hoods and with many an \'93at your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!\'94 But their spirits sank at his grave words, and they all felt that the adventure was far more dangerous than they had thought, while all the time, even if they passed all the perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end.\
All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate with Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they mounted the steeds he was lending them, and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his gate at a good pace.\
As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned north and then bore to the north-west. By his advice they were no longer making for the main forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass, their path would have led them down a stream from the mountains that joined the great river miles south of the Carrock. At that point there was a deep ford which they might have passed, if they had still had their ponies, and beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road. But Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the goblins, while the forest-road itself, he had heard, was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long\
\
 been lost. Its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when they got to the other side. North of the Carrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River, and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take this way; for at a place a few days\'92 ride due north of the Carrock was the gate of a little- known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain.\
\'93The goblins,\'94 Beorn had said, \'93will not dare to cross the Great River for a hundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my house \'97it is well protected at night!\'97but I should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they will have the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick asyoumay!\'94\
That is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just\
\
 turned west when they started, and till evening it lay golden on the land about them. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when they had put many miles between them and Beorn\'92s house they began to talk and to sing again and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. But in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins.\
Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo\
\
 thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction. But if he dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: \'93Hush! Take no notice!\'94\
Next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As soon as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting for them like a black and frowning wall before them. The land began to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon them. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, their leaves were dark and long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground.\
\'93Well, here is Mirkwood!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93The greatest of the forests of the Northern world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you must send back these excellent ponies you have borrowed.\'94\
The dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they were fools. \'93Beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises anyway,\
\
 for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins\'92 eyes are sharper than yours, if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us or sitting far off in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and guide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest.\'94\
\'93What about the horse, then?\'94 said Thorin. \'93You don\'92t mention sending that back.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t, because I am not sending it.\'94\
\'93What about your promise then?\'94\
\'93I will look after that. I am not sending the\
horse back, I am riding it!\'94\
Then they knew that Gandalf was going to\
leave them at the very edge of Mirkwood, and they were in despair. But nothing they could say would change his mind.\
\'93Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock,\'94 he said. \'93It is no use arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing business away south; and I am already late through bothering with you people. We may meet again before all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends on your luck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr. Baggins with you. I have told you\
\
 before that he has more about him than you guess, and you will find that out before long. So cheer up Bilbo and don\'92t look so glum. Cheer up Thorin and Company! This is your expedition after all. Think of the treasure at the end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!\'94\
When tomorrow morning came he still said the same. So now there was nothing left to do but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They distributed the packages as fairly as they could, though Bilbo thought his lot was wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that on his back.\
\'93Don\'92t you worry!\'94 said Thorin. \'93It will get lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short.\'94\
Then at last they said good-bye to their ponies and turned their heads for home. Off they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their tails towards the shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing like a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them.\
Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had\
\
 gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in there in the morning as at night, and very secret: \'93a sort of watching and waiting feeling,\'94 he said to himself.\
\'93Good-bye!\'94 said Gandalf to Thorin. \'93And goodbye to you all, good-bye! Straight through the forest is your way now. Don\'92t stray off the track!\'97if you do, it is a thousand to one you will never find it again and never get out of Mirkwood; and then I don\'92t suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again.\'94\
\'93Do we really have to go through?\'94 groaned the hobbit.\
\'93Yes, you do!\'94 said the wizard, \'93if you want to get to the other side. You must either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back out now, Mr. Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of it. You have got to look after all these dwarves for me,\'94 he laughed.\
\'93No! no!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I didn\'92t mean that. I meant, is there no way round?\'94\
\'93There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that south. But you wouldn\'92t get a safe path even then. There are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round Mirkwood in the\
\
 North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey Mountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description. Before you could get round it in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won\'92t need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don\'92t advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you.\'94\
\'93Very comforting you are to be sure,\'94 growled Thorin. \'93Good-bye! If you won\'92t come with us, you had better get off without any more talk!\'94\
\'93Good-bye then, and really good-bye!\'94 said Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode down into the West. But he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called to them. They heard his voice come faintly: \'93Good-bye! Be good, take care of yourselves\'97and DON\'92T LEAVE THE PATH!\'94\
Then he galloped away and was soon lost\
\
 to sight. \'93O good-bye and go away!\'94 grunted the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was their share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest.\
\

 Chapter VIII\
  \
 FLIES AND SPIDERS\
 They walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened.\
As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either side in a sort of darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before them. But\
\
 this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether. There were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo\'92s sharp inquisitive eyes got used to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree- trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick in places on the forest-floor; but what made the noises he could not see. The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick,\
often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either side of them. There were none stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not guess.\
It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces. There was no movement of air down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make\
\
 a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt that he was being slowly suffocated.\
The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark\'97not what you call pitch-dark, but really pitch: so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see eyes. They slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch; and when it was Bilbo\'92s turn he would see gleams in the darkness round them, and sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes would stare at him from a little distance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out again in another place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above him; and that was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. \'93Insect eyes,\'94 he thought, \'93not animal eyes, only they are much too big.\'94\
Although it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all round them, though the creatures, whatever they were, were careful never to let their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands of\
\
 dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and whirring round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness.\
All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions. Even so, as days followed days, and still the forest seemed just the same, they began to get anxious. The food would not last for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before they managed to bring one down on the path. But when they roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels.\
They were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time they had seen neither spring nor stream. This was their state when one day they found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. It was well that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As it was they only thought of how to\
\
 cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken posts near the bank.\
Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: \'93There is a boat against the far bank! Now why couldn\'92t it have been this side!\'94\
\'93How far away do you think it is?\'94 asked Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo had the sharpest eyes among them.\
\'93Not at all far. I shouldn\'92t think above twelve yards.\'94\
\'93Twelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but my eyes don\'92t see as well as they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as good as a mile. We can\'92t jump it, and we daren\'92t try to wade or swim.\'94\
\'93Can any of you throw a rope?\'94\
\'93What\'92s the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which I doubt.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t believe it is tied,\'94 said Bilbo, \'93though of course I can\'92t be sure in this light; but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the water.\'94\
\'93Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight,\'94 said Thorin. \'93Come here Fili, and see if you can see\
\
 the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.\'94\
Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction, the others brought him a rope. They had several with them, and on the end of the longest they fastened one of the large iron hooks they had used for catching their packs to the straps about their shoulders. Fili took this in his hand, balanced it for a moment, and then flung it\
across the stream.\
Splash it fell in the water! \'93Not far enough!\'94\
said Bilbo who was peering forward. \'93A couple of feet and you would have dropped it on to the boat. Try again. I don\'92t suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit of wet rope.\'94\
Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time he threw it with great strength.\
\'93Steady!\'94 said Bilbo, \'93you have thrown it right into the wood on the other side now. Draw it back gently.\'94 Fili hauled the rope back slowly, and after a while Bilbo said: \'93Carefully! It is lying on the boat; let\'92s hope the hook will catch.\'94\
It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to his help, and then Oin and Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly they all fell over on their backs. Bilbo was on the look out, however, caught the rope, and with a\
\
 piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the stream. \'93Help!\'94 he shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the boat before it floated off down the current.\
\'93It was tied after all,\'94 said he, looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it. \'93That was a good pull, my lads; and a good job that our rope was the stronger.\'94\
\'93Who\'92ll cross first?\'94 asked Bilbo.\
\'93I shall,\'94 said Thorin, \'93and you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That\'92s as many as the boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.\'94\
\'93I\'92m always last and I don\'92t like it,\'94 said Bombur. \'93It\'92s somebody else\'92s turn today.\'94\
\'93You should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and lightest boatload. Don\'92t start grumbling against orders, or something bad will happen to you.\'94\
\'93There aren\'92t any oars. How are you going to push the boat back to the far bank?\'94 asked the hobbit.\
\'93Give me another length of rope and another hook,\'94 said Fili, and when they had got it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and as high as he could throw it. Since it did not fall down again, they saw that it must have stuck in the branches. \'93Get in now,\'94 said Fili, \'93and one\
\
 of you haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on the other side. One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used at first, and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back.\'94\
In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to follow, when something bad did happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It charged into the dwarves and bowled them over, then gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But it did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. As soon as they had landed he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it reached the further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.\
Before they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds. \'93Bombur has fallen in! Bombur is drowning!\'94 he cried. It\
\
 was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span slowly off and disappeared.\
They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank. Quickly, they flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. He was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but that was not the worst. When they laid him on the bank he was already fast asleep, with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his grasp; and fast asleep he remained in spite of all they could do.\
They were still standing over him, cursing their ill luck, and Bombur\'92s clumsiness, and lamenting the loss of the boat which made it impossible for them to go back and look for the hart, when they became aware of the dim blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as of dogs baying far off. Then they all fell silent; and as they sat it seemed they could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the path, though they saw no sign of it.\
There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur slept on with a\
\
 smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed them. Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. They glimmered in the shadows. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark. The deer turned and vanished in the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them.\
\'93Stop! stop!\'94 shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them were useless.\
They were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it the path seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the forest they could see no change. Yet if they had known more about it and considered the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path, they would have known that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon have come, if they could have kept up their courage and their hope, to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came again.\
\
 But they did not know this, and they were burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which they had to carry along with them as best they could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their packs. If these had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have managed it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for packs filled with food however heavy. In a few days a time came when there was practically nothing left to eat or to drink. Nothing wholesome could they see growing in the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell.\
About four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most of the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. There was a greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either side of the path. Yet the light only showed them endless lines of straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on. Their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the\
\
 banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest.\
Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. Sometimes there was singing in the distance too. The laughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted, rather they hurried on from those parts with what strength they had left.\
Two days later they found their path going downwards, and before long they were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.\
\'93Is there no end to this accursed forest?\'94 said Thorin. \'93Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round. The only way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path.\'94\
Of course \'93somebody\'94 meant Bilbo. They chose him, because to be of any use the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves, and so he must be light enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up he had to go as best he could. He pushed his way through\
\
 the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to get down again (except by falling).\
In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo\'92s eyes were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long while before he could bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a sea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect they were a kind of \'93purple emperor\'94, a butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but these were not purple at all, they were a dark dark velvety black without any markings to be seen.\
He looked at the \'93black emperors\'94 for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in\
\
 his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping with impatience down below, reminded him of his real business. It was no good. Gaze as much as he might, he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, that had been lightened by the sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food to go back to down below.\
Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great bowl, and he could not expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he did not see this, and he climbed down full of despair. He got to the bottom again at last, scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not see anything in the gloom below when he got there. His report soon made the others as miserable as he was.\
\'93The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? And what is the use of sending a hobbit!\'94 they cried, as if it was his fault. They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more angry when he told them of the\
\
 beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to climb up and feel.\
That night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next morning when they woke the first thing they noticed was that they were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and there the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only reminded them that they were also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly from Bombur.\
He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head. He could not make out where he was at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had forgotten everything that had happened since they started their journey that May morning long ago. The last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit\'92s house, and they had great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures they had had since.\
When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak\
\
 and wobbly in the legs. \'93Why ever did I wake up!\'94 he cried. \'93I was having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps swinging from the branches and fires burning on the ground; and there was a great feast going on, going on for ever. A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves, and there was a merry singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink.\'94\
\'93You need not try,\'94 said Thorin. \'93In fact if you can\'92t talk about something else, you had better be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with you as it is. If you hadn\'92t waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons.\'94\
There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and trudge along the track without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died of starvation. This they did all that day, going very slowly and wearily; while Bombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to lie down and sleep.\
\'93No you don\'92t!\'94 they said. \'93Let your legs take their share, we have carried you far\
\
 enough.\'94\
All the same he suddenly refused to go a\
step further and flung himself on the ground. \'93Go on, if you must,\'94 he said. \'93I\'92m just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can\'92t get it any other way. I hope I never wake up again.\'94\
At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: \'93What was that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest.\'94\
They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was in front of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way off their track.\
\'93It looks as if my dreams were coming true,\'94 gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn.\
\'93A feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from it,\'94 said Thorin.\
\'93But without a feast we shan\'92t remain alive much longer anyway,\'94 said Bombur, and Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it\
\
 backwards and forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them. But then they could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and never finding his friends again. In the end, in spite of warnings, hunger decided them, because Bombur kept on describing all the good things that were being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path and plunged into the forest together.\
After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled. There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great circle. There was a fire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round about; but most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily.\
The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult one another, every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into the ring with the one idea of begging for some food. No sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the\
\
 lights went out as if by magic. Somebody kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost in a completely lightless dark and they could not even find one another, not for a long time at any rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom, falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and shouting and calling till they must have waked everything in the forest for miles, at last they managed to gather themselves in a bundle and count themselves by touch. By that time they had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least till morning.\
There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of becoming separated again. But they had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud whisper:\
\'93The lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than ever of them.\'94\
Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching the back of the one in front. When they got near Thorin said: \'93No\
\
 rushing forward this time! No one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won\'92t be frightened of him\'97(\'91What about me of them?\'92 thought Bilbo) \'97and any way I hope they won\'92t do anything nasty to him.\'94\
When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind. Before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell.\
If it had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. And they simply could not find the hobbit. Every time they counted themselves it only made thirteen. They shouted and called: \'93Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?\'94 and other things of that sort, but there was no answer.\
They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. It took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when he was awake he was not pleased at all.\
\'93I was having such a lovely dream,\'94 he grumbled, \'93all about having a most gorgeous dinner.\'94\
\
 \'93Good heavens! he has gone like Bombur,\'94 they said. \'93Don\'92t tell us about dreams. Dream- dinners aren\'92t any good, and we can\'92t share them.\'94\
\'93They are the best I am likely to get in this beastly place,\'94 he muttered, as he lay down beside the dwarves and tried to go back to sleep and find his dream again.\
But that was not the last of the lights in the forest. Later when the night must have been getting old, Kili who was watching then, came and roused them all again, saying:\
\'93There\'92s a regular blaze of light begun not far away\'97hundreds of torches and many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and the harps!\'94\
After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try once more to get help. Up they got again; and this time the result was disastrous. The feast that they now saw was greater and more magnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair, very much as Bombur had described the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires, and some were harping and many were singing. Their gleaming hair was\
\
 twined with flowers; green and white gems glinted on their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth. Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin in to their midst.\
Dead silence fell in the middle of a word. Out went all light. The fires leaped up in black smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with their clamour and their cries.\
Bilbo found himself running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling: \'93Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield,\'94 while people he could not see or feel were doing the same all round him (with an occasional \'93Bilbo!\'94 thrown in). But the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left alone in complete silence and darkness.\
That was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that it was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and quite useless to go\
\
 blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its beautiful pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.\
Then the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came from behind him and came at him. He could only see the thing\'92s eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round and round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight before he got free. He beat the creature off with his hands\'97it was trying to poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders do to flies\'97until he remembered his sword and drew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose. After that it was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was not used to things that carried such stings at their sides, or it would have hurried away\
\
 quicker. Bilbo came at it before it could disappear and stuck it with his sword right in the eyes. Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, until he killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and remembered nothing more for a long while.\
There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about him when he came to his senses. The spider lay dead beside him, and his sword-blade was stained black. Somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath.\
\'93I will give you a name,\'94 he said to it, \'93and I shall call you Sting.\'94\
After that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves.\
\
 \'93O! why did we not remember Beorn\'92s advice, and Gandalf\'92s!\'94 he lamented. \'93What a mess we are in now! We! I only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone.\'94\
In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for help had come in the night\'97and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) he guessed more or less right, as you will see. Having made up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in woods, as I have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before he started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming.\
He had picked his way stealthily for some distance, when he noticed a place of dense black shadow ahead of him, black even for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was made by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were\
\
 speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said. They were talking about the dwarves!\
\'93It was a sharp struggle, but worth it,\'94 said one. \'93What nasty thick skins they have to be sure, but I\'92ll wager there is good juice inside.\'94\
\'93Aye, they\'92ll make fine eating, when they\'92ve hung a bit,\'94 said another.\
\'93Don\'92t hang \'92em too long,\'94 said a third. \'93They\'92re not as fat as they might be. Been feeding none too well of late, I should guess.\'94\
\'93Kill \'92em, I say,\'94 hissed a fourth; \'93kill \'92em now and hang \'92em dead for a while.\'94\
\'93They\'92re dead now, I\'92ll warrant,\'94 said the first.\
\'93That they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. Just coming round again, I should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I\'92ll show you.\'94\
With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a row from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, now that he noticed them for the first time dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles, or here and there the tip of a nose, or abitofbeardorofahood.\
To the fattest of these bundles the spider went\'97\'93It is poor old Bombur, I\'92ll bet,\'94 thought\
\
 Bilbo\'97and nipped hard at the nose that stuck out. There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard. There was life in Bombur still. There was a noise like the kicking of a flabby football, and the enraged spider fell off the branch, only catching itself with its own thread just in time.\
The others laughed. \'93You were quite right,\'94 they said, \'93the meat\'92s alive and kicking!\'94\
\'93I\'92ll soon put an end to that,\'94 hissed the angry spider climbing back onto the branch.\
Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of\
\
 the aiming and throwing sort\'97indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven\'92t had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up.\
The next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was a deal of commotion in the spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a bit, I can tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they came running and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of waving snares.\
Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious spiders further and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, excited and angry all at once. When about fifty had gone off to the place where he had stood before, he threw some more stones at these,\
\
 and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he began to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice.\
This is what he sang:\
Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can\'92t see me!\
Attercop! Attercop! Won\'92t you stop,\
Stop your spinning and look for me?\
Old Tomnoddy, all big body, Old Tomnoddy can\'92t spy me!\
Attercop! Attercop! Down you drop!\
You\'92ll never catch me up your tree!\
Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up himself, on the spur of a very awkward moment. It did what he wanted any way. As he sang he threw some more stones and stamped. Practically all the spiders in the place came after him: some\
\
 dropped to the ground, others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark spaces. They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected. They were frightfully angry. Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.\
Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of the spiders had run now to different points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round him\'97that at least was the spiders\'92 idea. Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up his courage and began a new song:\
Lazy Lob and crazy Cob\
are weaving webs to wind me.\
I am far more sweet than other meat, but still they cannot find me!\
Here am I, naughty little fly;\
\
 you are fat and lazy.\
You cannot trap me, though you try, in your cobwebs crazy.\
With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had been closed with a web\'97but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double-thick spider-rope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to trunk. Out came his little sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off singing.\
The spiders saw the sword, though I don\'92t suppose they knew what it was, and at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as he dared. Then quieter than a mouse he stole back.\
He had precious little time, he knew, before the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees where the dwarves were hung. In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don\'92t suppose he would have managed it, if a spider had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its\
\
 help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he scrambled up\'97only to meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. It had thought of starting the feast while the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry, and before the spider knew what was happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch dead.\
Bilbo\'92s next job was to loose a dwarf. What was he to do? If he cut the string which hung him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch (which made all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle.\
\'93Fili or Kili,\'94 he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top. \'93Most likely Fili,\'94 he thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding threads. He managed by leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a struggle most of Fili emerged. I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on the spider-string under his armpits, just like one of those funny toys bobbing on a wire.\
Somehow or other Fili was got on to the\
\
 branch, and then he did his best to help the hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill from spider-poison, and from hanging most of the night and the next day wound round and round with only his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well, between them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe at all (long noses are sometimes useful you see) and some had been more poisoned.\
In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur was so exhausted\'97he was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked\'97that he just rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves hanging at the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full of rage than ever.\
Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten to put it on again, so now they all began to splutter and hiss:\
\
 \'93Now we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you and leave your bones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he\'92s got a sting has he? Well, we\'92ll get him all the same, and then we\'92ll hang him head downwards for a day or two.\'94\
While this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the captives, and cutting at the threads with their knives. Soon all would be free, though it was not clear what would happen after that. The spiders had caught them pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the dark. This time there looked like being a horrible battle.\
Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old Bombur on the floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. He gave a shout and slashed at the spiders in front of him. They quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those on the ground. His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them. How it darted to and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen were killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo.\
\'93Come down! Come down!\'94 he shouted to the dwarves on the branch. \'93Don\'92t stay up there and be netted!\'94 For he saw spiders swarming\
\
 up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the dwarves.\
Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very shaky and little use on their legs. There they were at last, twelve of them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either side by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round and about and above. It looked pretty hopeless.\
Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had his elvish dagger. Again and again the spiders were beaten off, and many of them were killed. But it could not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already the spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree.\
In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of his ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped.\
\'93I am going to disappear,\'94 he said. \'93I shall\
\
 draw the spiders off, if I can; and you must keep together and make in the opposite direction. To the left there, that is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elf- fires.\'94\
It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last Bilbo felt he could delay no longer\'97the spiders were drawing their circle ever closer. He suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great astonishment of the dwarves he vanished.\
Soon there came the sound of \'93Lazy Lob\'94 and \'93Attercop\'94 from among the trees away on the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They stopped advancing, and some went off in the direction of the voice. \'93Attercop\'94 made them so angry that they lost their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo\'92s plan better than the rest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower of stones they drove at the spiders on the left, and burst through the ring. Away behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped.\
Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on. Not fast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better than a hobble and a\
\
 wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind. Every now and then they had to turn and fight the creatures that were overtaking them; and already some spiders were in the trees above them and throwing down their long clinging threads.\
Things were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side.\
\'93Go on! Go on!\'94 he shouted. \'93I will do the stinging!\'94\
And he did. He darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if they came too near. The spiders swelled with rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed out horrible curses; but they had become mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come very near, now that it had come back. So curse as they would, their prey moved slowly but steadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single stroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it up, and followed them no more, but went back disappointed to their dark colony.\
The dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had\
\
 been. Whether it was one of those they had seen the night before, they could not tell. But it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots, which the spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath.\
There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. But very soon they began to ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while they forgot their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper place. But after a time the light began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where were they, and where was their path, and where was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From which you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have a great respect for him (as Gandalf had said they would). Indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful plan for helping them, and were not merely grumbling. They knew only too\
\
 well that they would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. Some of them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over with the effort, and could not get on their legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not lessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as well as luck and a magic ring\'97 and all three are very useful possessions. In fact they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there really was something of a bold adventurer about himself after all, though he would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat.\
But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them were fit to go and look for anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost path! No other idea would come into Bilbo\'92s tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin. Long after the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself.\
\'93Gollum! Well I\'92m blest! So that\'92s how he sneaked past me, is it? Now I know! Just crept quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all over the doorstep! Good old Bilbo\'97Bilbo\'97 Bilbo\'97bo\'97bo\'97bo\'97\'94 And then he fell asleep,\
\
 and there was complete silence for a long while.\
All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. \'93Where is Thorin?\'94 he asked.\
It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They wondered what evil fate had befallen him, magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest. There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and there we must leave them for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or to take turns at watching.\
Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away.\
The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are not wicked folk. If they have a\
\
 fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves of the West, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of them (together with their scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were descended from the ancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There the Light- elves and the Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and wiser and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft in the making of beautiful and marvellous things, before some came back into the Wide World. In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon, but loved best the stars; and they wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often by the edges of the woods, from which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves they were and remain, and that is Good People.\
In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at this time their greatest king. Before his huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of\
\
 the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller ones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had many passages and wide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses or huts on the ground and in the branches. The beeches were their favourite trees. The king\'92s cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against their enemies.\
It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged Thorin\'97not too gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing their treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give them their pay. If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and though his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as\
\
 other elf-lords of old. His people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with trade or with tilling the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin\'92s family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of him, when they took their spell off him and he came to his senses; and also he was determined that no word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him.\
The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he was brought before him, and asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving.\
\'93Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their merrymaking?\'94 asked the king.\
\'93We did not attack them,\'94 answered Thorin; \'93we came to beg, because we were starving.\'94\
\'93Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?\'94\
\'93I don\'92t know, but I expect starving in the forest.\'94\
\'93What were you doing in the forest?\'94\
\'93Looking for food and drink, because we were starving.\'94\
\'93But what brought you into the forest at all?\'94 asked the king angrily.\
At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not\
\
 say another word.\
\'93Very well!\'94 said the king. \'93Take him away\
and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.\'94\
Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of both, if not very fine; for Wood-elves were not goblins, and were reasonably well-behaved even to their worst enemies, when they captured them. The giant spiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon.\
There in the king\'92s dungeon poor Thorin lay; and after he had got over his thankfulness for bread and meat and water, he began to wonder what had become of his unfortunate friends. It was not very long before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which the hobbit again showed his usefulness.\

 Chapter IX\
  \
 BARRELS OUT OF BOND\
 The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt.\
There was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only weapons they had, would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird\'92s eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and sat down and waited \'97all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and\
\
 slipped quickly to one side. That is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the other, and counted them, they never found or counted the hobbit.\
Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torch-light as they led off their prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see where they were going, and neither he nor the others knew where they had started from anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary as they were. The king had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the bridge. This was the bridge that led across the river to the king\'92s doors. The water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. There the great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream.\
Across the bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth, and he only made up his mind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the last elves, before the great gates of the king\
\
 closed behind them with a clang.\
Inside the passages were lit with red torch-\
light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like those of the goblin-cities; they were smaller, less deep underground, and filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring he wore a crown of woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak.\
 \
  The Elvenking's Gate.\
The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, he told his men to unbind them, for they were ragged and weary. \'93Besides they need no ropes in here,\'94 said he. \'93There is no escape from my magic doors for those who are once brought inside.\'94\
Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little more news out of them than out of Thorin. They were surly and angry and did not even pretend to be polite.\
\
 \'93What have we done, O king?\'94 said Balin, who was the eldest left. \'93Is it a crime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you angry?\'94\
Such a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: \'93It is a crime to wander in my realm without leave. Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that my people made? Did you not three times pursue and trouble my people in the forest and rouse the spiders with your riot and clamour? After all the disturbance you have made I have a right to know what brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until you have learned sense and manners!\'94\
Then he ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given food and drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons, until one at least of them was willing to tell him all he wanted to know. But he did not tell them that Thorin was also a prisoner with him. It was Bilbo who found that out.\
Poor Mr. Baggins\'97it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly\
\
 daring to sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest corners he could find. For something to do he took to wandering about the Elvenking\'92s palace. Magic shut the gates, but he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the Wood-elves, sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride out to hunt, or to other business in the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of being bumped into and discovered. And when he did go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. He was hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand.\
\'93I am like a burglar that can\'92t get away, but must go on miserably burgling the same house\
\
 day after day,\'94 he thought. \'93This is the dreariest and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with the lamp shining!\'94 He often wished, too, that he could get a message for help sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and he soon realized that if anything was to be done, it would have to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone and unaided.\
Eventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching and following the guards and taking what chances he could, he managed to find out where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very well. What was his surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of course, that that was Thorin; and after a while he found that his guess was right. At last after many difficulties he managed to find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves.\
Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was even beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low- spirited he had become), when he heard\
\
 Bilbo\'92s little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side.\
So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin\'92s message to each of the other imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand, and that no one was to reveal their errand to the king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how the hobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was determined once more not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of escaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.\
The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought their own shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the Wood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and leaving them.\
\
 Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea would come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but it was not much good among fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it happened.\
One day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of which the main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there was a water- gate. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But the portcullis was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in by the water- gate. If anyone had come in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point where it passed under the caves the roof\
\
 had been cut away and covered with great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the king\'92s cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels, and barrels; for the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.\
Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king\'92s servants, he learned how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges far into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially against the dragon of the Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were brought up the Forest River. Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.\
When the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors, opened the water- gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which\
\
 stood close to the point where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.\
For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate beginnings of a plan.\
The evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were tramping away down the passages taking the torchlight with them and leaving everything in darkness. Then Bilbo heard the king\'92s butler bidding the chief of the guards good-night.\
\'93Now come with me,\'94 he said, \'93and taste the new wine that has just come in. I shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour.\'94\
\'93Very good,\'94 laughed the chief of the guards. \'93I\'92ll taste with you, and see if it is fit for the king\'92s table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor stuff!\'94\
When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two\
\
 large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king\'92s feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler\'92s great flagons.\
Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages towards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms, and his heart was often in his mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble.\
First he unlocked Balin\'92s door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the dwarf was outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but glad as he was to get out of his wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it.\
\
 \'93No time now!\'94 said the hobbit. \'93You just follow me! We must all keep together and not risk getting separated. All of us must escape or none, and this is our last chance. If this is found out, goodness knows where the king will put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. Don\'92t argue, there\'92s a good fellow!\'94\
Then off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to twelve\'97none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with their long imprisonment. Bilbo\'92s heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. \'93Drat this dwarvish racket!\'94 he said to himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king\'92s folk were merrymaking.\
At last after much blundering they came to Thorin\'92s dungeon, far down in a deep place and fortunately not far from the cellars.\
\'93Upon my word!\'94 said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his friends, \'93Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am sure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after this. But what comes next?\'94\
Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His\
\
 fears were quite justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their danger.\
\'93We shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!\'94 they muttered. \'93We thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!\'94\
\'93Very well!\'94 said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. \'93Come along back to your nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan\'97but I don\'92t suppose I shall ever get hold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.\'94\
That was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of course, they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for them to try and find their way into the upper halls, or to fight their way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the passages until they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they crept. They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler could be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces. The wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There would be a different expression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before they went on, stole in and kind-\
\
 heartedly put the keys back on his belt.\
\'93That will save him some of the trouble he is in for,\'94 said Mr. Baggins to himself. \'93He wasn\'92t a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. It will puzzle them all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all those locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy very quick, if that is to\
happen!\'94\
Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the stream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured again. But among them were several others, which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king\'92s palace.\
They soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some were too roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves\
\
 thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping they would get inside, though Bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short time. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could be managed, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off.\
It had not been done a bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin\'92s lid had been fitted on there came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. A number of elves came laughing and talking into the cellars and singing snatches of song. They had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent on returning as soon as they could.\
\'93Where\'92s old Galion, the butler?\'94 said one. \'93I haven\'92t seen him at the tables tonight. He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done.\'94\
\'93I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,\'94 said another. \'93I have no wish to waste time down here while the song is up!\'94\
\
 \'93Ha, ha!\'94 came a cry. \'93Here\'92s the old villain with his head on a jug! He\'92s been having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain.\'94\
\'93Shake him! Wake him!\'94 shouted the others impatiently.\
Galion was not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still less at being laughed at. \'93You\'92re all late,\'94 he grumbled. \'93Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows drink and make merry and forget your tasks. Small wonder if I fall asleep from weariness!\'94\
\'93Small wonder,\'94 said they, \'93when the explanation stands close at hand in a jug! Come give us a taste of your sleeping-draught before we fall to! No need to wake the turnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it.\'94\
Then they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden. But they did not quite lose their wits. \'93Save us, Galion!\'94 cried some, \'93you began your feasting early and muddled your wits! You have stacked some full casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight.\'94\
\'93Get on with the work!\'94 growled the butler. \'93There is nothing in the feeling of weight in an idle toss-pot\'92s arms. These are the ones to go and no others. Do as I say!\'94\
\'93Very well, very well,\'94 they answered rolling the barrels to the opening. \'93On your head be it, if the king\'92s full buttertubs and his best wine is\
\
 pushed into the river for the Lake-men to feast on for nothing!\'94\
Roll\'97roll\'97roll\'97roll, roll-roll-rolling down the hole! Heave ho! Splash plump! Down they go, down they bump!\
So they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the dark opening and was pushed over into the cold water some feet below. Some were barrels really empty, some were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down they all went, one after another, with many a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones below, smacking into the water, jostling against the walls of the tunnel, knocking into one another, and bobbing away down the current.\
It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him; but I don\'92t suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of course he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if there had been a chance! It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and\
\
 have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected. He wondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, or what he had meant to do, once they were out of the wood.\
While all these thoughts were passing through his mind, the elves being very merry began to sing a song round the river-door. Some had already gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate so as to let out the barrels as soon as they were all afloat below.\
Down the swift dark stream you go Back to lands you once did know! Leave the halls and caverns deep, Leave the northern mountains steep, Where the forest wide and dim Stoops in shadowgrey and grim! Float beyond the world of trees\
Out into the whispering breeze, Past the rushes, past the reeds, Past the marsh\'92s waving weeds, Through the mist that riseth white\
\
 Up from mere and pool at night! Follow,followstarsthatleap\
Up the heavens cold and steep; Turn when dawn comes over land, Over rapid, over sand,\
South away! and South away! Seek the sunlight and the day, Back to pasture, back to mead, Where the kine and oxen feed! Back to gardens on the hills Where the berry swells and fills Under sunlight, under day!\
South away! and South away! Down the swift dark stream you go Back to lands you once did know!\
Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not knowing what else to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with the barrel on top of him.\
He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, the barrel rolled round and ducked him under again. It was really empty, and floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with\
\
above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with\
 a boom and their voices faded away. He was in the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone\'97 for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels.\
Very soon a grey patch came in the darkness ahead. He heard the creak of the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream. He had as much as he could do to prevent himself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stony arch and away. Then he saw that it would have been no good even if he had managed to get astride his barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even for a hobbit, between its top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was.\
Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs. Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside.\
\'93I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!\'94 he\
\
 thought, but before long he was worrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves. He managed to keep his head above the water, but he was shivering with the cold, and he wondered if he would die of it before the luck turned, and how much longer he would be able to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to swim to the bank.\
The luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was cold but better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once more.\
Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream, and out into the main current. Then he found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, though it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very light, and the barrel was a good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water. All the same it was like trying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied\
\
 pony that was always thinking of rolling on the grass.\
In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the king\'92s great doors. There was a dim sheet of water no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing and broken reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the hurrying water of the Forest River swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On the shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump against the stony pier.\
There were people on the look-out on the banks. They quickly poled and pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them they roped them together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and then sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water\'92s edge. He no longer thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he had been\
\
 obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now only too well what it was to be really hungry, not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled larder. Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.\
There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course helped by his magic ring he got on very well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes. Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air was chilly.\
He woke again with a specially loud\
\
 sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft- elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake-town. Bilbo sneezed again. He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over. He scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in time to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good while.\
There was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and shoved. The barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted.\
\'93This is a heavy load!\'94 some grumbled. \'93They float too deep\'97some of these are never empty. If they had come ashore in the daylight, we might have had a look inside,\'94 they said.\
\'93No time now!\'94 cried the raftman. \'93Shove off!\'94 And off they went at last, slowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles, and then quicker and quicker as they caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down towards the Lake.\
They had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but whether alive or dead still remains to be seen.\

 Chapter X\
  \
 A WARM WELCOME\
 The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river rounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The shores sank. The trees ended. Then Bilbo saw a sight:\
The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side; but still a strong water flowed on steadily through the midst. And far away, its dark head in a torn cloud, there loomed the Mountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North- East and the tumbled land that joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes to the forest. The Lonely\
\
 Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through many adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least.\
As he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of information they let fall, he soon realized that he was very fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from this distance. Dreary as had been his imprisonment and unpleasant as was his position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves underneath him) still, he had been more lucky than he had guessed. The talk was all of the trade that came and went on the waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the East towards Mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood- elves about the upkeep of the Forest River and the care of the banks. Those lands had changed much since the days when dwarves dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people now remembered only as a very shadowy tradition. They had changed even in recent years, and since the last news that Gandalf had had of them. Great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon\'97alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in\
\
 the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across. The elf-road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the mountain- shadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves\'92 king.\
So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin\'92s company. But Bilbo did not know it.\
All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After a while, however, the river took a more southerly course and the Mountain receded again, and at last, late in the day the shores\
\
 grew rocky, the river gathered all its wandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood, and they swept along at great speed.\
The sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the East the forest-river rushed into the Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth with stony clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo had never imagined that any water that was not the sea could look so big. It was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far, but it was so long that its northerly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be seen at all. Only from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were already twinkling, the Running River came down into the lake from Dale and with the Forest River filled with deep waters what must once have been a great deep rocky valley. At the southern end the doubled waters poured out again over high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still evening air the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar.\
Not far from the mouth of the Forest River was the strange town he heard the elves speak of in the king\'92s cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there were a few huts and buildings there, but right out on the surface of\
\
 the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest trees was built a busy wooden town, not a town of elves but of Men, who still dared to dwell here under the shadow of the distant dragon- mountain. They still throve on the trade that came up the great river from the South and was carted past the falls to their town; but in the great days of old, when Dale in the North was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on the waters, and some were filled with gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had been wars and deeds which were now only a legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could still be seen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.\
But men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of the dwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain- gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business.\
\
 \
  As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of the town, and voices hailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the Forest River and towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of Lake-town. There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge. Soon men would come up from the South and take some of the casks away, and others they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the Wood-elves\'92 home. In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town.\
They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down by the shore, after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen. First of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened. Groans came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet straw was in his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or\
\
 stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a famished and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you could only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit.\
\'93Well, are you alive or are you dead?\'94 asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps he had forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves, and also the use of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater allowance of air. \'93Are you still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if you want to go on with this silly adventure\'97it\'92s yours after all and not mine\'97you had better slap your arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!\'94\
Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans he got up and helped the hobbit as well as he could. In the darkness floundering in the cold water they had a difficult and very nasty job finding which were the right barrels. Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six dwarves that could answer. These were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay muttering and\
\
 moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it.\
Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking them to help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier, but they lay down and would do nothing. Fili and Kili, however, who were young (for dwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that soon wore off.\
\'93I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!\'94 said Fili. \'93My tub was full of it. To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat anything in the wide world now, for hours on end\'97but not an apple!\'94\
With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore.\
\'93Well! Here we are!\'94 said Thorin. \'93And I suppose we ought to thank our stars and Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it,\
\
 though I wish he could have arranged a more comfortable journey. Still\'97all very much at your service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?\'94\
\'93I suggest Lake-town,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93What else is there?\'94\
Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were guards at the head of it, but they were not keeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need. Except for occasional squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far away; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. That being so it is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield stepped in through the door.\
\'93Who are you and what do you want?\'94 they shouted leaping to their feet and groping for\
\
 weapons.\
\'93Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King\
under the Mountain!\'94 said the dwarf in a loud voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood. The gold gleamed on his neck and waist; his eyes were dark and deep. \'93I have come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!\'94\
Then there was tremendous excitement. Some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if they expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow right away. The captain of the guard came forward.\
\'93And who are these?\'94 he asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo.\
\'93The sons of my father\'92s daughter,\'94 answered Thorin, \'93Fili and Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West.\'94\
\'93If you come in peace lay down your arms!\'94 said the captain.\
\'93We have none,\'94 said Thorin, and it was true enough: their knives had been taken from them by the wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had his short sword, hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that. \'93We have no need of weapons, who return at last to our own as spoken of old. Nor could we fight\
\
 against so many. Take us to your master!\'94\
\'93He is at feast,\'94 said the captain.\
\'93Then all the more reason for taking us to\
him,\'94 burst in Fili, who was getting impatient at these solemnities. \'93We are worn and famished after our long road and we have sick comrades. Now make haste and let us have no more words, or your master may have something to say to you.\'94\
\'93Follow me then,\'94 said the captain, and with six men about them he led them over the bridge through the gates and into the market-place of the town. This was a wide circle of quiet water surrounded by the tall piles on which were built the greater houses, and by long wooden quays with many steps and ladders going down to the surface of the lake. From one great hall shone many lights and there came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and stood blinking in the light looking at long tables filled with folk.\
\'93I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!\'94 cried Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything.\
All leaped to their feet. The Master of the town sprang from his great chair. But none rose in greater surprise than the raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall.\
\
 Pressing forward before the Master\'92s table they cried:\
\'93These are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and molesting our people!\'94\
\'93Is this true?\'94 asked the Master. As a matter of fact he thought it far more likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever existed.\
\'93It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elvenking and imprisoned without cause as we journeyed back to our own land,\'94 answered Thorin. \'93But lock nor bar may hinder the homecoming spoken of old. Nor is this town in the Wood-elves\'92 realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the Lake, not to the raft- men of the king.\'94\
Then the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other. The Elvenking was very powerful in those parts and the Master wished for no enmity with him, nor did he think much of old songs, giving his mind to trade and tolls, to cargoes and gold, to which habit he owed his position. Others were of different mind, however, and quickly the matter was settled without him. The news had spread from the doors of the hall like fire through all the town.\
\
 People were shouting inside the hall and outside it. The quays were thronged with hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the King under the Mountain; that it was Thror\'92s grandson not Thror himself that had come back did not bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the lake.\
The King beneath the mountains, The King of carven stone,\
The lord of silver fountains Shall come into his own!\
His crown shall be upholden, His harp shall be restrung,\
His halls shall echo golden To songs of yore re-sung.\
The woods shall wave on mountains And grass beneath the sun;\
Hiswealthshallflowinfountains And the rivers golden run.\
\
 The streams shall run in gladness, The lakes shall shine and burn,\
All sorrowfail and sadness\
At the Mountain-king\'92s return!\
So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with it. Indeed such excitement had not been known in the town in the memory of the oldest grandfather. The Wood-elves themselves began to wonder greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and they began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili beside him in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of where he came in\'97no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way\'97was asked for in the general bustle.\
Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of\
\
 astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and satisfactory fashion. A large house was given up to Thorin and his company; boats and rowers were put at their service; and crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his nose.\
Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke confidently of the sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich presents coming down the river to Lake-town. These were inspired largely by the Master and they did not particularly please the dwarves, but in the meantime they were well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if his kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little pieces.\
Then, as he had said, the dwarves\'92 good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger every day. There were no more groans or grumbles. They drank his health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which was just as well, for he was\
\
 not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of the dragon, and he had besides a shocking cold. For three days he sneezed and coughed, and he could not go out, and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to \'93Thag you very buch.\'94\
In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their cargoes, and there was great excitement in the king\'92s palace. I have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of course was ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the king knew now the dwarves\'92 errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself:\
\'93Very well! We\'92ll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve them right!\'94 He at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he\
\
 strongly suspected attempted burglary or something like it\'97which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward towards the Mountain as they would go, and waited.\
At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the enthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help. It would not do to let everything cool down with delay. So he spoke to the Master and his councillors and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain.\
Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings. He had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach Smaug, but believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be turned out. He was wrong. Thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the King under the Mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the recovery of his own.\
But the Master was not sorry at all to let them go. They were expensive to keep, and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday\
\
 in which business was at a standstill. \'93Let them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes them!\'94 he thought. \'93Certainly, O Thorin Thrain\'92s son Thror\'92s son!\'94 was what he said. \'93You must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained.\'94\
So one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves were falling fast, three large boats left Lake- town, laden with rowers, dwarves, Mr. Baggins, and many provisions. Horses and ponies had been sent round by circuitous paths to meet them at their appointed landing-place. The Master and his councillors bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall that went down to the lake. People sang on the quays and out of windows. The white oars dipped and splashed, and off they went north up the lake on the last stage of their long journey. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.\

 Chapter XI\
  \
 ON THE DOORSTEP\
In two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the River Running, and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim and tall before them. The stream was strong and their going slow. At the end of the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They packed what they could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store under a tent, but none of the men of the town would stay with them even for the night so near the shadow of the Mountain.\
\'93Not at any rate until the songs have come true!\'94 said they. It was easier to believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed their stores had no need of any guard, for all the land was desolate and empty. So their escort left them, making off swiftly down the river and the shoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on.\
They spent a cold and lonely night and their spirits fell. The next day they set out again. Balin and Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden beside him; the others were some way ahead picking out a slow road, for\
 \
 there were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running, and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out southwards towards them.\
It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or song or sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old songs by the lake died away to a plodding gloom. They knew that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, and that it might be a very horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though once, as Thorin told them, it had been green and fair. There was little grass, and before long there was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished. They were come to the Desolation of the Dragon, and they were come at the waning of the year.\
They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his lair. The Mountain lay dark and silent before them and ever higher above them. They made their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur, which ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post; but they dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed.\
Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy out the land to the South where the Front Gate stood. For this\
\
 purpose he chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing swift and noisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above the stream; and gazing out from it over the narrow water, foaming and splashing among many boulders, they could see in the wide valley shadowed by the Mountain\'92s arms the grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls.\
\'93There lies all that is left of Dale,\'94 said Balin. \'93The mountain\'92s sides were green with woods and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when the bells rang in that town.\'94 He looked both sad and grim as he said this: he had been one of Thorin\'92s companions on the day the Dragon came.\
They did not dare to follow the river much further towards the Gate; but they went on beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock they could look out and see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff- wall between the arms of the Mountain. Out of it the waters of the Running River sprang; and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. Nothing moved in the waste, save the vapour and the water, and every now and again a black and ominous crow. The only sound was the sound of the stony water, and every now and again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin shuddered.\
\'93Let us return!\'94 he said. \'93We can do no good here! And I don\'92t like these dark birds, they look like spies of evil.\'94\
\
 The Front Gate.\
\'93The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then\'97or I imagine so from the smoke,\'94 said the hobbit.\
\
the smoke,\'94 said the hobbit.\
 \'93That does not prove it,\'94 said Balin, \'93though I don\'92t doubt you are right. But he might be gone away some time, or he might be lying out on the mountain-side keeping watch, and still I expect smokes and steams would come out of the gates: all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.\'94\
With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they made their weary way back to the camp. Only in June they had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and though autumn was now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now seemed years ago. They were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left.\
Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more than the others. He would often borrow Thorin\'92s map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of the moon-letters Elrond had read. It was he that made the dwarves begin the dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door. They moved their camp then to a long valley, narrower than the great dale in the South where the Gates of the river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this western side there were fewer signs of the dragon\'92s marauding feet, and there was some grass for their ponies. From this western camp, shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun\
\
 began to sink towards the forest, day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths up the mountain-side. If the map was true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley\'92s head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back to their camp without success.\
But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its southern corner. About midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain. Looking down they saw that they were at the top of the cliff at the valley\'92s head and were gazing down on to their own camp below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file along the ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. Its entrance which they had found could not be seen from below because of the overhang of the cliff, nor from further off because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was not a cave and was open to the sky above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up that in the lower part, close to the ground, was as smooth and upright as masons\'92 work, but without a joint or crevice to be seen. No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not doubt that they had found the door at last.\
\
 They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, they implored it to move, they spoke fragments of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. At last tired out they rested on the grass at its feet, and then at evening began their long climb down.\
There was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to move once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them from the river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay.\
There they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with their ropes. Down the same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the more active dwarves, such as Kili, to exchange such news as there was, or to take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to the higher camp. Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path.\
\'93I am too fat for such fly-walks,\'94 he said. \'93I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.\'94 Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.\
\
 In the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and found a path that led higher and higher on to the mountain; but they did not dare to venture very far that way, nor was there much use in it. Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. The others who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success. They were too eager to trouble about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth face of the rock the door was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town, and at first they tried to use these. But when they struck the stone the handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. Mining work, they saw clearly, was no good against the magic that had shut this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.\
Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome\'97there was not a doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening the \'93doorstep\'94 in fun, remembering Bilbo\'92s words long ago at the unexpected party in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of something. And sit and think they did, or wandered aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became.\
Their spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now they sank into their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no longer much\
\
 brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with his back to the rock-face and stare away west through the opening, over the cliff, over the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in which he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains small and far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered:\
\'93You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to mention getting inside, so I am sitting and thinking.\'94 But I am afraid he was not thinking much of the job, but of what lay beyond the blue distance, the quiet Western Land and the Hill and his hobbit-hole under it.\
A large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great snails. They seemed to love the little shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there were many of them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides.\
\'93Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,\'94 said Thorin one day.\
\'93And winter comes after autumn,\'94 said Bifur.\
\'93And next year after that,\'94 said Dwalin, \'93and our beards will grow till they hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here. What is our burglar doing for us? Since he has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially excellent performer now, I am beginning to think he might go through the Front Gate and spy things out a bit!\'94\
Bilbo heard this\'97the dwarves were on the rocks just above the enclosure where he was\
\
 sitting\'97and \'93Good Gracious!\'94 he thought, \'93so that is what they are beginning to think, is it? It is always poor me that has to get them out of their difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to do? I might have known that something dreadful would happen to me in the end. I don\'92t think I could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that steaming gate! ! !\'94\
That night he was very miserable and hardly slept. Next day the dwarves all went wandering off in various directions; some were exercising the ponies down below, some were roving about the mountain-side. All day Bilbo sat gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone, or out west through the narrow opening. He had a queer feeling that he was waiting for something. \'93Perhaps the wizard will suddenly come back today,\'94 he thought.\
If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the sun turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the last pale leaves. Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes. He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth.\
At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack!\
Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the dwarves, shouting and waving. Those that were nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him,\
\
 wondering what on earth was the matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the ropes (except Bombur, of course: he was asleep).\
Quickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. The sun sank lower and lower, and their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and disappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood almost without moving. The little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the cloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old thrush, who had been watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a sudden trill. There was a loud crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground.\
Quickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and pushed\'97in vain.\
\'93The key! The key!\'94 cried Bilbo. \'93Where is Thorin?\'94\
Thorin hurried up.\
\'93The key!\'94 shouted Bilbo. \'93The key that went with the map! Try it now while there is still time!\'94 Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key\
on its chain from round his neck. He put it to the hole. It fitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun sank, the moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky.\
Now they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rock-wall gave way. Long straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet\
\
 high and three broad was outlined, and slowly without a sound swung inwards. It seemed as if darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain-side, and deep darkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes, a yawning mouth leading in and down.\
\
 \
 Chapter XII\
  \
 INSIDE INFORMATION\
 For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last Thorin spoke:\
\'93Now is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a good companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far exceeding his size, and if I may say so possessed of good luck far exceeding the usual allowance\'97now is the time for him to perform the service for which he was included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward.\'94\
You are familiar with Thorin\'92s style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of it, though he went on a good deal longer than this. It certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.\
\
 \'93If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain\'92s son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer,\'94 he said crossly, \'93say so at once and have done! I might refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so that I am, I think, already owed some reward. But \'91third time pays for all\'92 as my father used to say, and somehow I don\'92t think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck more than I used to in the old days\'94\'97he meant last spring before he left his own house, but it seemed centuries ago\'97\'93but anyway I think I will go and have a peep at once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?\'94\
He did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and Kili looked uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering\'97except old Balin, the lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary.\
The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their best to get\
\
 him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don\'92t expect too much.\
The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than he expected. This was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves\'92 cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying slope direct\'97to some distant end in the blackness below.\
After a while Balin bade Bilbo \'93Good luck!\'94 and stopped where he could still see the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the others just outside. Then the\
\
 hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than hobbit\'92s care to make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. He was trembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. Already he was a very different hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket- handkerchief from Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on.\
\'93Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,\'94 he said to himself. \'93You went and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!\'94 said the least Tookish part of him. \'93I have absolutely no use for dragon- guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at home!\'94\
He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had faded away. He was altogether alone. Soon he thought it was beginning to feel warm. \'93Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right\
\
 ahead down there?\'94 he thought.\
It was. As he went forward it grew and grew,\
till there was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it was now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him.\
It was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit\'92s little head. Before him lies the great bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the Mountain\'92s root. It is almost dark so that its vastness can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of\
\
 Smaug!\
There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy light.\
Smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed. Behind him where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled with a wealth that could not be guessed.\
To say that Bilbo\'92s breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards\
\
 before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count.\
He gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. He grasped a great two- handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring changed its note.\
Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake\'97not yet\'97but shifted into other dreams of greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart was beating and a more fevered shaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his chief thought was: \'93I\'92ve done it! This will show them. \'91More like a grocer than a burglar\'92\
\
 indeed! Well, we\'92ll hear no more of that.\'94\
Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the back and put themselves and all their families for generations\
to come at his service.\
The dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble.\
Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be\
\
 reckoned with. It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. Dragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He had passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. There was a breath of strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? He had never felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now he glared at it in suspicion and wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down through it to his lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to sniff. Then he missed the cup!\
Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first he came to the Mountain! His rage passes description\'97the sort of rage that is only seen when rich folk that have more than they can enjoy suddenly lose something that they have long had but have never before used or wanted. His fire belched forth, the hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust his head in vain at the little hole, and then\
\
 coiling his length together, roaring like thunder underground, he sped from his deep lair through its great door, out into the huge passages of the mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate.\
To hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and trampled him was his one thought. He issued from the Gate, the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet flame. The dwarves heard the awful rumour of his flight, and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace cringing under boulders, hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the hunting dragon.\
There they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again. \'93Quick! Quick!\'94 he gasped. \'93The door! The tunnel! It\'92s no good here.\'94\
Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when Bifur gave a cry: \'93My cousins! Bombur and Bofur\'97 we have forgotten them, they are down in the valley!\'94\
\'93They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all our stores lost,\'94 moaned the others. \'93We can do nothing.\'94\
\'93Nonsense!\'94 said Thorin, recovering his\
\
 dignity. \'93We cannot leave them. Get inside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili\'97 the dragon shan\'92t have all of us. Now you others, where are the ropes? Be quick!\'94\
Those were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet. The horrible sounds of Smaug\'92s anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above; at any moment he might come blazing down or fly whirling round and find them there, near the perilous cliff\'92s edge hauling madly on the ropes. Up came Bofur, and still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then danger was upon them.\
A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points of standing rocks. The dragon came.\
They had barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled the grass before the door, and drove in through the crack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid. Flickering fires leaped up and black rock- shadows danced. Then darkness fell as he passed again. The ponies screamed with\
\
 terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.\
\'93That\'92ll be the end of our poor beasts!\'94 said Thorin. \'93Nothing can escape Smaug once he sees it. Here we are and here we shall have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river with Smaug on the watch!\'94\
It was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there they lay and shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale through the crack of the door. Every now and again through the night they could hear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted round and round the mountain-sides.\
He guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps he had discovered, that men had come up from the river and the lake and had scaled the mountain-side from the valley where the ponies had been standing; but the door withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden couch to sleep\'97and to gather new strength. He would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a thousand years turned him to smouldering\
\
 stone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and silent he crept back to his lair and half closed his eyes.\
When morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. They realized that dangers of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving up their quest yet. Nor could they get away just now, as Thorin had pointed out. Their ponies were lost or killed, and they would have to wait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot. Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them still for some time.\
They debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of getting rid of Smaug\'97which had always been a weak point in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for what had at first so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug\'92s wrath so soon.\
\'93What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?\'94 asked Bilbo angrily. \'93I was not engaged to kill dragons, that is warrior\'92s work, but to steal treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to\
\
 be done, I think I might have a say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. I should want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit.\'94\
After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. \'93What then do you propose we should do, Mr. Baggins?\'94 asked Thorin politely.\
\'93I have no idea at the moment\'97if you mean about removing the treasure. That obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to think about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at home.\'94\
\'93Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now, to-day?\'94\
\'93Well, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but stay where we are. By day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air. Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside the tunnel by night.\
\'93Now I will make you an offer. I have got my\
\
 ring and will creep down this very noon\'97then if ever Smaug ought to be napping\'97and see what he is up to. Perhaps something will turn up. \'91Every worm has his weak spot,\'92 as my father used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience.\'94\
Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. When midday came he got ready for another journey down into the Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it was not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of him. Had he known more about dragons and their wily ways, he might have been more frightened and less hopeful of catching this one napping.\
The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent was his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it, and he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the lower door. There was only the very faintest glow to be seen.\
\'93Old Smaug is weary and asleep,\'94 he thought. \'93He can\'92t see me and he won\'92t hear me. Cheer up Bilbo!\'94 He had forgotten or had\
\
 never heard about dragons\'92 sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact that they can keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.\
Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of Smaug\'92s left eye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the tunnel entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck of his ring. Then Smaug spoke.\
\'93Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!\'94\
But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. \'93No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!\'94 he replied. \'93I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did not believe them.\'94\
\
 \'93Do you now?\'94 said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not believe a word ofit.\
\'93Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities,\'94 replied Bilbo.\
\'93You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\'94 said the dragon. \'93You seem familiar with my name, but I don\'92t seem to remember smelling you before. Who are you and where do you come from, may I ask?\'94\
\'93You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led. And through the air. I am he that walks unseen.\'94\
\'93So I can well believe,\'94 said Smaug, \'93but that is hardly your usual name.\'94\
\'93I am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.\'94\
\'93Lovely titles!\'94 sneered the dragon. \'93But lucky numbers don\'92t always come off.\'94\
\'93I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me.\'94\
\'93These don\'92t sound so creditable,\'94 scoffed Smaug.\
\'93I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I\
\
 am Barrel-rider,\'94 went on Bilbo beginning to be pleased with his riddling.\
\'93That\'92s better!\'94 said Smaug. \'93But don\'92t let your imagination run away with you!\'94\
This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don\'92t want to reveal your proper name (which is wise), and don\'92t want to infuriate them by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about Bilbo\'92s adventures to which he was referring), but he thought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside.\
\'93I thought so last night,\'94 he smiled to himself. \'93Lake-men, some nasty scheme of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I\'92m a lizard. I haven\'92t been down that way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!\'94\
\'93Very well, O Barrel-rider!\'94 he said aloud. \'93Maybe Barrel was your pony\'92s name; and maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way. Let me tell you I ate six ponies last night and I shall catch and eat all the others before long. In\
\
 return for the excellent meal I will give you one piece of advice for your good: don\'92t have more to do with dwarves than you can help!\'94\
\'93Dwarves!\'94 said Bilbo in pretended surprise.\
\'93Don\'92t talk to me!\'94 said Smaug. \'93I know the smell (and taste) of dwarf\'97no one better. Don\'92t tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not know it! You\'92ll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends, Thief Barrel-rider. I don\'92t mind if you go back and tell them so from me.\'94 But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily.\
\'93I suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?\'94 he went on. \'93Come now, did you? Nothing at all! Well, that\'92s just like them. And I suppose they are skulking outside, and your job is to do all the dangerous work and get what you can when I\'92m not looking\'97for them? And you will get a fair share? Don\'92t you believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky.\'94\
Bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug\'92s roving eye, seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across\
\
 him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again.\
\'93You don\'92t know everything, O Smaug the Mighty,\'94 said he. \'93Not gold alone brought us hither.\'94\
\'93Ha! Ha! You admit the \'91us\'92\'94 laughed Smaug. \'93Why not say \'91us fourteen\'92 and be done with it, Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you had other business in these parts besides my gold. In that case you may, perhaps, not altogether waste your time.\
\'93I don\'92t know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit by bit\'97a matter of a hundred years or so\'97you could not get it very far? Not much use on the mountain- side? Not much use in the forest? Bless me! Had you never thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it, those were the terms, eh? But what about delivery? What about cartage? What about armed guards and tolls?\'94 And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily heart, and he knew his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was\
\
 meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had been called Esgaroth.\
You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback. So far all his thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain and finding the entrance. He had never bothered to wonder how the treasure was to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill.\
Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind\'97had the dwarves forgotten this important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? That is the effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming personality.\
\'93I tell you,\'94 he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, \'93that gold was only an afterthought with us. We came over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for Revenge. Surely, O Smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?\'94\
Then Smaug really did laugh\'97a devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end.\
\
 \'93Revenge!\'94 he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet lightning. \'93Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and where are his kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons\'92 sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the warriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!\'94 he gloated. \'93My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!\'94\
\'93I have always understood,\'94 said Bilbo in a frightened squeak, \'93that dragons were softer underneath, especially in the region of the\'97er \'97chest; but doubtless one so fortified has thought of that.\'94\
The dragon stopped short in his boasting. \'93Your information is antiquated,\'94 he snapped. \'93I am armoured above and below with iron scales and hard gems. No blade can pierce me.\'94\
\'93I might have guessed it,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!\'94\
\
 \'93Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,\'94 said Smaug absurdly pleased. He did not know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his own. The dragon rolled over. \'93Look!\'94 he said. \'93What do you say to that?\'94\
\'93Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!\'94 exclaimed Bilbo aloud, but what he thought inside was: \'93Old fool! Why, there is a large patch in the hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!\'94\
After he had seen that Mr. Baggins\'92 one idea was to get away. \'93Well, I really must not detain Your Magnificence any longer,\'94 he said, \'93or keep you from much needed rest. Ponies take some catching, I believe, after a long start. And so do burglars,\'94 he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel.\
It was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him, and fast though he sped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far enough to be comfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the opening behind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather\
\
 pleased with the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense.\
\'93Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!\'94 he said to himself, and it became a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb. \'93You aren\'92t nearly through this adventure yet,\'94 he added, and that was pretty true as well.\
The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint on the \'91doorstep\'92. The dwarves revived him, and doctored his scorches as well as they could; but it was a long time before the hair on the back of his head and his heels grew properly again: it had all been singed and frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped.\
But the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getting anything out of him. On thinking things over he was now regretting some of the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat\
\
 them. The old thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side, listening to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back.\
\'93Drat the bird!\'94 said Bilbo crossly. \'93I believe he is listening, and I don\'92t like the look of him.\'94\
\'93Leave him alone!\'94 said Thorin. \'93The thrushes are good and friendly\'97this is a very old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of my father and grandfather. They were a long-lived and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were alive then, a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have the trick of understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake and elsewhere.\'94\
\'93Well, he\'92ll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after,\'94 said Bilbo; \'93though I don\'92t suppose there are any people left there that trouble with thrush-language.\'94\
\'93Why what has happened?\'94 cried the dwarves. \'93Do get on with your tale!\'94\
So Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his\
\
 riddles added to the camps and the ponies. \'93I am sure he knows we came from Lake-town and had help from there; and I have a horrible feeling that his next move may be in that direction. I wish to goodness I had never said that about Barrel-rider; it would make even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake- men.\'94\
\'93Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I have always heard,\'94 said Balin anxious to comfort him. \'93I think you did very well, if you ask me\'97you found out one very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is more than most can say who have had words with the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare patch in the old Worm\'92s diamond waistcoat.\'94\
That turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon-slayings historical, dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different arts devices and stratagems by which they had been accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely to end in disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while they talked the thrush listened, till at last when\
\
 the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread its wings and flew away. And all the while they talked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo became more and more unhappy and his foreboding grew.\
At last he interrupted them. \'93I am sure we are very unsafe here,\'94 he said, \'93and I don\'92t see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the night has come and it is cold. But I feel it in my bones that this place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, and you can trust him to guess where the other end of the tunnel is. He will break all this side of the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our entrance, and if we are smashed with it the better he will like it.\'94\
\'93You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!\'94 said Thorin. \'93Why has not Smaug blocked the lower end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not, or we should have heard him.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t know, I don\'92t know\'97because at first he wanted to try and lure me in again, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight\'92s hunt, or because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it\'97but I wish you would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the\
\
 door.\'94\
He seemed so much in earnest that the\
dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting the door\'97it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew whether or how they could get it open again from the inside, and the thought of being shut in a place from which the only way out led through the dragon\'92s lair was not one they liked. Also everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and down the tunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the half-open door and went on talking.\
The talk turned to the dragon\'92s wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard them, or at least that he could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been won. \'93We knew it would be a desperate venture,\'94 said Thorin, \'93and we know that still; and I still think that when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. Baggins, I assure you we are more than grateful and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as soon as we have anything to divide. I am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties are great\'97the lands have not\
\
 become less wild with the passing of time, rather the reverse\'97but we will do whatever we can for you, and take our share of the cost when the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!\'94\
From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in the hall below: the spears that were made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for; shields made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two- handed, hammered and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel. But fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.\
\'93The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!\'94 murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with\
\
 his chin upon his knees. \'93It was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!\'94\
But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through their talk he was only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound without, his other was alert for echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a movement from far below.\
Darkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. \'93Shut the door!\'94 he begged them, \'93I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!\'94\
Something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain!\
And not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on\
\
 their heads. What would have happened if the door had still been open I don\'92t like to think. They fled further down the tunnel glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of Smaug\'92s fury. He was breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their little lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, the thrush\'92s stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the valley below.\
Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares something or somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the thief had used. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see nothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.\
After he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in his heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In the meanwhile he had further vengeance to take. \'93Barrel-rider!\'94 he snorted. \'93Your feet came from the waterside and up the water you came without a doubt. I don\'92t know your smell, but if\
\
 you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!\'94\
He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.\
\
 \
 Chapter XIII\
  \
 NOT AT HOME\
 In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing of time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no longer. They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon\'92s return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could not sit there for ever.\
Thorin spoke: \'93Let us try the door!\'94 he said. \'93I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here!\'94 So several of\
\
 the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would ever open that door again.\
\'93We are trapped!\'94 they groaned. \'93This is the end. We shall die here.\'94\
But somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his waistcoat.\
\'93Come, come!\'94 he said. \'93\'91While there\'92s life there\'92s hope!\'92 as my father used to say, and \'91Third time pays for all.\'92 I am going down the tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, when I knew there was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the only way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me.\'94\
In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo\'92s side.\
\'93Now do be careful!\'94 whispered the hobbit, \'93and as quiet as you can be! There may be no Smaug at the bottom, but then again there may be. Don\'92t let us take any unnecessary risks!\'94\
Down, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real\
\
 stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every now and again Bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well as he could judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into the hall!\
There he lay face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a gleam of light\'97unless, as it seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his tongue.\
At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. \'93Confound you, Smaug, you worm!\'94 he squeaked aloud. \'93Stop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can catch me!\'94\
Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer.\
\
 Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.\
\'93Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,\'94 he said. \'93He is not at home today (or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not lost their tinder-boxes, perhaps we can make a little light, and have a look round before the luck turns.\'94\
\'93Light!\'94 he cried. \'93Can anybody make a light?\'94\
The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end of the tunnel.\
\'93Sh! sh!\'94 they hissed, when they heard his voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find out where they were, it was some time before he could get anything else out of them. But in the end, when Bilbo actually began to stamp on the floor, and screamed out \'93light!\'94 at the top of his shrill voice, Thorin gave way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel.\
After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others\
\
 under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As Thorin carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door and watched.\
They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise dancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon he stood upon the top, and still went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason.\
It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin\'92s description; but indeed there could not be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many\
\
 colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch. At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.\
Suddenly Bilbo\'92s arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment. His small hand would not close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket.\
\'93Now I am a burglar indeed!\'94 thought he. \'93But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it\'97 some time. They did say I could pick and choose my own share; and I think I would choose this, if they took all the rest!\'94 All the same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it.\
Now he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall.\
\
 He went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped timidly through, and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at him, and brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped head downwards and went out!\
\'93Only a bat, I suppose and hope!\'94 he said miserably. \'93But now what am I to do? Which is East, South, North, or West?\'94\
\'93Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!\'94 he cried as loud as he could\'97it seemed a thin little noise in the wide blackness. \'93The light\'92s gone out! Someone come and find me and help me!\'94 For the moment his courage had failed altogether.\
Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could catch was \'93help!\'94\
\'93Now what on earth or under it has happened?\'94 said Thorin. \'93Certainly not the dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.\'94\
They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact\
\
 but Bilbo\'92s distant voice. \'93Come, one of you, get another light or two!\'94 Thorin ordered. \'93It seems we have got to go and help our burglar.\'94\
\'93It is about our turn to help,\'94 said Balin, \'93and I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it is safe for the moment.\'94\
Gloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and went along the wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long before they met Bilbo himself coming back towards them. His wits had quickly returned as soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights.\
\'93Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!\'94 he said in answer to their questions. Though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don\'92t know. The mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he may become fierce.\
The dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to explore the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, Smaug was away from\
\
 home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and even caution. They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light, caressing and fingering them.\
Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small interest in music) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that had long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they gathered gems and stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry fall back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin was not least among these; but always he searched from side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone; but he spoke of it yet to no one.\
Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver- hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.\
\'93Mr. Baggins!\'94 he cried. \'93Here is the first payment of your reward! Cast off your old coat\
\
 and put on this!\'94\
With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of\
mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long ago. It was of silver-steel, which the elves call mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm of figured leather, strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the brim with white gems, was set upon the hobbit\'92s head.\
\'93I feel magnificent,\'94 he thought; \'93but I expect I look rather absurd. How they would laugh on the Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking- glass handy!\'94\
All the same Mr. Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures, he became weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. \'93I would give a good many of these precious goblets,\'94 he thought, \'93for a drink of something cheering out of one of Beorn\'92s wooden bowls!\'94\
\'93Thorin!\'94 he cried aloud. \'93What next? We are armed, but what good has any armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet won back. We are not looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; and we have tempted luck too long!\'94\
\
 \'93You speak the truth!\'94 answered Thorin, recovering his wits. \'93Let us go! I will guide you. Not in a thousand years should I forget the ways of this palace.\'94 Then he hailed the others, and they gathered together, and holding their torches above their heads they passed through the gaping doors, not without many a backward glance of longing.\
Their glittering mail they had covered again with their old cloaks and their bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often, listening in fear once more for any rumour of the dragon\'92s coming.\
Though all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and though all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the monster, Thorin knew every passage and every turn. They climbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair; and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts.\
The steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he\
\
 could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their torch-light. A white glimmer could be seen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter. Before them light came dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt.\
\'93This is the great chamber of Thror,\'94 said Thorin; \'93the hall of feasting and of council. Not far off now is the Front Gate.\'94\
They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were upon the floor among flagons and bowls and broken drinking- horns and dust. As they came through yet more doors at the further end, a sound of water fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full.\
\'93There is the birth of the Running River,\'94 said Thorin. \'93From here it hastens to the Gate. Let us follow it!\'94\
Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn\'97and\
\
 behold! before them stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall arch, still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered and blackened though it was. A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold.\
A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over them; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon. Now before them the water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to the ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes. They were come to the Front Gate, and were looking out upon Dale.\
\'93Well!\'94 said Bilbo, \'93I never expected to be looking out of this door. And I never expected to be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel the wind on my face. But, ow! this wind is cold!\'94\
It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragon- haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun.\
Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry indeed. \'93It seems to\
\
 be late morning,\'94 he said, \'93and so I suppose it is more or less breakfast-time\'97if there is any breakfast to have. But I don\'92t feel that Smaug\'92s front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let\'92s go somewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!\'94\
\'93Quite right!\'94 said Balin. \'93And I think I know which way we should go: we ought to make for the old look-out post at the South-West corner of the Mountain.\'94\
\'93How far is that?\'94 asked the hobbit.\
\'93Five hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from the Gate along the left edge of the stream seems all broken up. But look down there! The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that climbed up the right bank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that left the road and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps are still there.\'94\
\'93Dear me!\'94 grumbled the hobbit. \'93More walking and more climbing without breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?\'94\
As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not altogether\
\
 without food) since the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had quite lost count, and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all he could tell.\
\'93Come, come!\'94 said Thorin laughing\'97his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled the precious stones in his pockets. \'93Don\'92t call my palace a nasty hole! You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated!\'94\
\'93That won\'92t be till Smaug\'92s dead,\'94 said Bilbo glumly. \'93In the meanwhile where is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the Mountain looking down at us!\'94\
That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo and Balin were right.\
\'93We must move away from here,\'94 said Dori. \'93I feel as if his eyes were on the back of my head.\'94\
\'93It\'92s a cold lonesome place,\'94 said Bombur. \'93There may be drink, but I see no sign of food. A dragon would always be hungry in such parts.\'94\
\'93Come on! Come on!\'94 cried the others. \'93Let us follow Balin\'92s path!\'94\
Under the rocky wall to the right there was no\
\
 path, so on they trudged among the stones on the left side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon sobered even Thorin again. The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old road, and before long came to a deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don\'92t know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.)\
After that they went on again; and now the road struck westwards and left the river, and the great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain- spur drew ever nearer. At length they reached the hill path. It scrambled steeply up, and they plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon they came to the top of the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West.\
Here they found a flat place without a wall\
\
 on three sides, but backed to the North by a rocky face in which there was an opening like a door. From that door there was a wide view East and South and West.\
\'93Here,\'94 said Balin, \'93in the old days we used always to keep watchmen, and that door behind leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made here as a guardroom. There were several places like it round the Mountain. But there seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards were made over comfortable, perhaps\'97otherwise we might have had longer warning of the coming of the dragon, and things might have been different. Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without being seen.\'94\
\'93Not much use, if we have been seen coming here,\'94 said Dori, who was always looking up towards the Mountain\'92s peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple.\
\'93We must take our chance of that,\'94 said Thorin. \'93We can go no further to-day.\'94\
\'93Hear, hear!\'94 cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground.\
In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber further in, more removed from the cold outside. It was quite deserted; not even wild\
\
 animals seemed to have used it in all the days of Smaug\'92s dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their plans. In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug? They looked West and there was nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the South there was no sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many birds. At that they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.\
\
 \
 Chapter XIV\
  \
 FIRE AND WATER\
 Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before.\
The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in the sky. From their town the Lonely Mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through a gap in which the Running River came down from the North. Only its high peak could they see in clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and drear even in the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone, blotted in the dark.\
Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief\
\
 glow touched it and faded.\
\'93Look!\'94 said one. \'93The lights again! Last\
night the watchmen saw them start and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there.\'94\
\'93Perhaps the King under the Mountain is forging gold,\'94 said another. \'93It is long since he went North. It is time the songs began to prove themselves again.\'94\
\'93Which king?\'94 said another with a grim voice. \'93As like as not it is the marauding fire of the Dragon, the only king under the Mountain we have ever known.\'94\
\'93You are always foreboding gloomy things!\'94 said the others. \'93Anything from floods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!\'94\
Then suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the northern end of the lake turned golden. \'93The King beneath the Mountain!\'94 they shouted. \'93His wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Mountain!\'94 they cried, and everywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying.\
There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But the grim- voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. \'93The dragon is coming or I am a fool!\'94 he cried. \'93Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!\'94\
\
 Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread. So it was that the dragon did not find them quite unprepared.\
Before long, so great was his speed, they could see him as a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright, and not the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. Still they had a little time. Every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior was armed, every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and destroyed, before the roar of Smaug\'92s terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire beneath the awful beating of his wings.\
Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them, swept towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on an island in deep water\'97too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If he plunged into it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier than he, it would quench him before he could pass through.\
Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and\
\
 rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled by his breath burning and hissing into the lake. No fireworks you ever imagined equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the trumpets the dragon\'92s wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. No one had dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor would they have dared now, if it had not been for the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight to the last arrow.\
Fire leaped from the dragon\'92s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight through the arrow- storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze.\
Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and past and round again, though all had been drenched with water before he came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the\
\
 Great House crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. Another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes.\
Already men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and children were being huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. Weapons were flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake.\
That was the dragon\'92s hope. They could all get into boats for all he cared. There he could have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. Soon he would set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. Just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed\
\
 anything for years.\
But there was still a company of archers\
that held their ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose friends had accused him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, though they knew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long ago. Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He bent his bow for the last time.\
Suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He started\'97but it was only an old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for he was of the race of Dale.\
\'93Wait! Wait!\'94 it said to him. \'93The moon is rising. Look for the hollow of the left breast as he flies and turns above you!\'94 And while Bard paused in wonder it told him of tidings up in the Mountain and of all that it had heard.\
Then Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings.\
\
 \'93Arrow!\'94 said the bowman. \'93Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true king under the Mountain, go now and speed well!\'94\
The dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived down his belly glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon\'97but not in one place. The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide. In it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight. With a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into the air, turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin.\
Full on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. The lake roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon. There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was the end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard.\
The waxing moon rose higher and higher and\
\
 the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses. But they had really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly be expected that they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at least escaped alive; their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of their boats remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet realized.\
They gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores, shivering in the cold wind, and their first complaints and anger were against the Master, who had left the town so soon, while some were still willing to defend it.\
\'93He may have a good head for business\'97 especially his own business,\'94 some murmured, \'93but he is no good when anything serious happens!\'94 And they praised the courage of Bard and his last mighty shot. \'93If only he had not been killed,\'94 they all said, \'93we would make him a king. Bard the Dragon-shooter of the line of\
\
 Girion! Alas that he is lost!\'94\
And in the very midst of their talk a tall figure\
stepped from the shadows. He was drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and a fierce light was in his eyes.\
\'93Bard is not lost!\'94 he cried. \'93He dived from Esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. I am Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon!\'94\
\'93King Bard! King Bard!\'94 they shouted; but the Master ground his chattering teeth.\
\'93Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth,\'94 he said. \'93In the Lake-town we have always elected masters from among the old and wise, and have not endured the rule of mere fighting men. Let \'91King Bard\'92 go back to his own kingdom\'97Dale is now freed by his valour, and nothing hinders his return. And any that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold stones under the shadow of the Mountain to the green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in time its peace and riches.\'94\
\'93We will have King Bard!\'94 the people near at hand shouted in reply. \'93We have had enough of the old men and the money-counters!\'94 And people further off took up the cry: \'93Up the Bowman, and down with Moneybags,\'94 till the\
\
 clamour echoed along the shore.\
\'93I am the last man to undervalue Bard the\
Bowman,\'94 said the Master warily (for Bard now stood close beside him). \'93He has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of many imperishable songs. But, why O People?\'94\'97and here the Master rose to his feet and spoke very loud and clear\'97\'93Why do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed? Who aroused the dragon from his slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that old songs could come true? Who played on our soft hearts and our pleasant fancies? What sort of gold have they sent down the river to reward us? Dragon-fire and ruin! From whom should we claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?\'94\
As you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of his words was that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their angry thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them deliberately!\
\
 \'93Fools!\'94 said Bard. \'93Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless they perished first in fire, before Smaug came to us.\'94 Then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of the Master\'92s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could but find the men.\
At length he spoke again: \'93This is no time for angry words, Master, or for considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still\'97though after a while I may think again of your words and go North with any that will follow me.\'94\
Then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and the wounded. But the Master scowled at his back as he went, and remained sitting on the ground. He thought much but said little, unless it was to call loudly for men to bring him fire and food.\
Now everywhere Bard went he found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of the recompense for all their harm that they would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and it cheered them greatly in their\
\
 plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master had one) and there was little food (even the Master went short). Many took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much sickness and great hunger.\
Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always in the Master\'92s name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most of them would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood, and these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of Smaug.\
The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. Very great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks,\
\
 and their swift-flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the borders of the Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: \'93Smaug is dead!\'94 Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at council in their caves.\
\'93That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,\'94 said the king. \'93He would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all the same,\'94 he added, \'93that blows no one any good.\'94 For he too had not forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard\'92s messengers found him now marching with many spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick above him, for they thought that war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age.\
But the king, when he received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the Mountain, he hastened now down the river to the Long Lake. He had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were forced to go the slower way\
\
 by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water. Still elves are light-footed, and though they were not in these days much used to the marches and the treacherous lands between the Forest and the Lake, their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the shores and looked on the ruins of the town. Their welcome was good, as may be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the future in return for the Elvenking\'92s aid.\
Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master remained behind; and with him were some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and they busied themselves felling trees, and collecting the timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about raising many huts by the shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master\'92s direction they began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than before, but not in the same place. They removed northward higher up the shore; for ever after they had a dread of the water where the dragon lay. He would never again return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined\
\
 piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the precious stones that fell from his rotting carcase.\
But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking\'92s array, got ready to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate lands.\

 Chapter XV\
  \
 THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS\
  Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had watched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling and crying unceasingly above.\
\'93Something strange is happening,\'94 said Thorin. \'93The time has gone for the autumn wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!\'94\
Suddenly Bilbo pointed: \'93There is that old thrush again!\'94 he cried. \'93He seems to have escaped, when Smaug smashed the mountain- side, but I don\'92t suppose the snails have!\'94\
\
 Sure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and perched on a stone near by. Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his head on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang, and again he listened.\
\'93I believe he is trying to tell us something,\'94 said Balin; \'93but I cannot follow the speech of such birds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you make it out Baggins?\'94\
\'93Not very well,\'94 said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at all); \'93but the old fellow seems very excited.\'94\
\'93I only wish he was a raven!\'94 said Balin.\
\'93I thought you did not like them! You seemed very shy of them, when we came this way before.\'94\
\'93Those were crows! And nasty suspicious- looking creatures at that, and rude as well. You must have heard the ugly names they were calling after us. But the ravens are different. There used to be great friendship between them and the people of Thror; and they often brought us secret news, and were rewarded with such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings.\
\'93They live many a year, and their memories are long, and they hand on their wisdom to their children. I knew many among the ravens of the\
\
 rocks when I was a dwarf-lad. This very height was once named Ravenhill, because there was a wise and famous pair, old Carc and his wife, that lived here above the guard-chamber. But I don\'92t suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now.\'94\
No sooner had he finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call, and immediately flew away.\
\'93We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure,\'94 said Balin. \'93Keep watch now, and see what happens!\'94\
Before long there was a fluttering of wings, and back came the thrush; and with him came a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, and the top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings, and bobbed towards Thorin.\
\'93O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin,\'94 he croaked (and Bilbo could understand what he said, for he used ordinary language and not bird-speech). \'93I am Ro\'e4c son of Carc. Carc is dead, but he was well known to you once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg, but I do not forget what my father told me. Now I am the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was\
\
 of old. Most of my people are abroad, for there are great tidings in the South\'97some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good.\
\'93Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from South and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!\'94\
\'93Dead! Dead?\'94 shouted the dwarves. \'93Dead! Then we have been in needless fear\'97 and the treasure is ours!\'94 They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy.\
\'93Yes, dead,\'94 said Ro\'e4c. \'93The thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we may trust his words. He saw him fall in battle with the men of Esgaroth the third night back from now at the rising of the moon.\'94\
It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the raven\'92s news. At length when he had told all the tale of the battle he went on:\
\'93So much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You may go back to your halls in safety; all the treasure is yours\'97for the moment. But many are gathering hither beside the birds. The news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share of the spoil.\
\
 Already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and slaughter. By the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and Smaug has destroyed their town. They too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead.\
\'93Your own wisdom must decide your course; but thirteen is small remnant of the great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you will listen to my counsel, you will not trust the Master of the Lake-men, but rather him that shot the dragon with his bow. Bard is he, of the race of Dale, of the line of Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more among dwarves and men and elves after the long desolation; but it may cost you dear in gold. I have spoken.\'94\
Then Thorin burst forth in anger: \'93Our thanks, Ro\'e4c Carc\'92s son. You and your people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent carry off while we are alive. If you would earn our thanks still more, bring us news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any of you are still young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains of the North, both west from here and east, and tell\
\
 them of our plight. But go specially to my cousin Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him hasten!\'94\
\'93I will not say if this counsel be good or bad,\'94 croaked Ro\'e4c, \'93but I will do what can be done.\'94 Then off he slowly flew.\
\'93Back now to the Mountain!\'94 cried Thorin. \'93We have little time to lose.\'94\
\'93And little food to use!\'94 cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. In any case he felt that the adventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the dragon\'97in which he was much mistaken\'97and he would have given most of his share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs.\
\'93Back to the Mountain!\'94 cried the dwarves as if they had not heard him; so back he had to go with them.\
As you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before them. They explored the caverns once more, and found, as they expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked by\
\
 Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled.\
As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they learned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a breathing space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from where the rest of their stores had been left. So while the others went on with their work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring back all they could.\
They were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies of the Lake- men and the Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now their hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care\'97 chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing\'97and already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high, across the opening. There were holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot), but\
\
 no entrance. They climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain- wall to the head of the fall over which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they had brought only to the head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden them return to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South.\
There came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches away south in Dale before them.\
\'93They have come!\'94 called Balin. \'93And their camp is very great. They must have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river.\'94\
That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a company approaching. From behind their wall they watched them come up to the valley\'92s head\
\
 and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were among them. At length the foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.\
As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: \'93Who are you,\'94 he called in a very loud voice, \'93that come as if in war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you desire?\'94\
But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them. That day the camp was moved to the east of the river, right between the arms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven- harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.\
Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth and feasting by the fires. Some of the younger\
\
 dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled.\
Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo\'92s little hobbit-hole.\
Under the Mountain dark and tall The King has come unto his hall! His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread, And ever so his foes shall fall.\
The sword is sharp, the spear is long, The arrowswift, the Gate is strong;\
The heart is bold that looks on gold; The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.\
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells\
\
 In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollowhalls beneath the fells.\
On silver necklaces they strung\
The light of stars, on crowns they hung The dragon-fire, from twisted wire\
The melody of harps they wrung.\
The mountain throne once more is freed! O! wandering folk, the summons heed! Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!\
The king of friend and kin has need.\
Nowcallweovermountainscold, \'91Come back unto the caverns old\'92! Here at the Gates the king awaits,\
His hands are rich with gems and gold.\
\
 The king is come unto his hall\
Under the Mountain dark and tall. The Worm of Dread is slain and dead, And ever so our foes shall fall!\
This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain, if he had set out as soon as the message reached him. But Bilbo\'92s heart fell, both at the song and the talk: they sounded much too warlike.\
The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river, and marching up the valley. They bore with them the green banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until they stood right before the wall at the Gate.\
Again Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: \'93Who are you that come armed for war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?\'94 This time he was answered.\
A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried: \'93Hail Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope. We came expecting to\
\
alive beyond our hope. We came expecting to\
 find none living here; yet now that we are met there is matter for a parley and a council.\'94\
\'93Who are you, and of what would you parley?\'94\
\'93I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter of which we may speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth, and I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought for the sorrow and misery of his people. They aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.\'94\
Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of course, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragon\'92s weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours\
\
brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours\
 in the past days Thorin had spent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race.\
\'93You put your worst cause last and in the chief place,\'94 Thorin answered. \'93To the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of life or home. The treasure was not his that his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it. The price of the goods and the assistance that we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay\'97in due time. But nothing will we give, not even a loaf\'92s worth, under threat of force. While an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves.\
\'93It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain.\'94\
\'93A just question,\'94 replied Bard. \'93But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain\
\
 unanswered.\'94\
\'93I will not parley, as I have said, with armed\
men at my gate. Nor at all with the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you would speak with me again, first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it belongs, and then return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold.\'94\
\'93The Elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the Lake in their need, though they had no claim but friendship on him,\'94 answered Bard. \'93We will give you time to repent your words. Gather your wisdom ere we return!\'94 Then he departed and went back to the camp.\
Ere many hours were past, the banner- bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth and blew a blast:\
\'93In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,\'94 one cried, \'93we speak unto Thorin Thrain\'92s son Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the Mountain, and we bid him consider well the claims that have been urged, or be declared our foe. At the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the treasure unto Bard, as the dragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From that portion Bard will himself contribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the\
\
 friendship and honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the Lake.\'94\
Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. It smote into his shield and stuck there quivering.\
\'93Since such is your answer,\'94 he called in return, \'93I declare the Mountain besieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to your gold. You may eat that, if you will!\'94\
With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider their case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the others would not have dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of them seemed to share his mind\'97except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had more than enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste.\
\'93The whole place still stinks of dragon,\'94 he grumbled to himself, \'93and it makes me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my throat.\'94\
\
 \
 \
 Chapter XVI\
  \
 A THIEF IN THE NIGHT\
 Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time piling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every corner.\
\'93For the Arkenstone of my father,\'94 he said, \'93is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and to me it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it.\'94\
Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found\'97wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head.\
\
 Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now within about two days\'92 march of Dale, coming from the North-East.\
\'93But they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked,\'94 said Ro\'e4c, \'93and I fear lest there be battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel good. Though they are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome the host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!\'94\
But Thorin was not moved. \'93Winter and snow will bite both men and elves,\'94 he said, \'93and they may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with.\'94\
That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon as it was full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a\
\
 time.\
\'93It is mighty cold!\'94 said Bombur. \'93I wish we\
could have a fire up here as they have in the camp!\'94\
\'93It is warm enough inside,\'94 said Bilbo.\
\'93I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,\'94 grumbled the fat dwarf. \'93A sorry business altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck.\'94\
\'93Not as stiff as my legs,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I would give a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes.\'94\
\'93I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after a good supper!\'94\
\'93I can\'92t give you those, while the siege is going on. But it is long since I watched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like. There is no sleep in me tonight.\'94\
\'93You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly. If there should be anything to note, rouse me first, mind you! I will lie in the inner chamber to the left, not far away.\'94\
\'93Off you go!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the next watchman.\'94\
As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on\
\
 his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over the wall, and was gone. He had about five hours before him. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, and ever since the adventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams he had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would come out on the wall until it was their turn.\
It was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made path and climbed down towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him. At last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he was to make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but already broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly across when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the cold water with a splash. He had barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise.\
\'93That was no fish!\'94 one said. \'93There is a spy about. Hide your lights! They will help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their servant.\'94\
\'93Servant, indeed!\'94 snorted Bilbo; and in the\
\
 middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound.\
\'93Let\'92s have a light!\'94 he said. \'93I am here, if you want me!\'94 and he slipped off his ring, and popped from behind a rock.\
They seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. \'93Who are you? Are you the dwarves\'92 hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get so far past our sentinels?\'94 they asked one after another.\
\'93I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,\'94 he answered, \'93companion of Thorin, if you want to know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn\'92t know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want to see.\'94\
\'93Indeed!\'94 said they, \'93and what may be your business?\'94\
\'93Whatever it is, it\'92s my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get back to your own woods from this cold cheerless place,\'94 he answered shivering, \'93you will take me along quick to a fire, where I can dry\'97and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or two to spare.\'94\
That is how it came about that some two hours\
\
 after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them.\
\'93Really you know,\'94 Bilbo was saying in his best business manner, \'93things are impossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West in my own home, where folk are more reasonable. But I have an interest in this matter\'97one fourteenth share, to be precise, according to a letter, which fortunately I believe I have kept.\'94 He drew from a pocket in his old jacket (which he still wore over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin\'92s letter that had been put under the clock on his mantelpiece in May!\
\'93A share in the profits, mind you,\'94 he went on. \'93I am aware of that. Personally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own claim. However you don\'92t know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here.\'94\
\'93Well, let him!\'94 said Bard. \'93Such a fool deserves to starve.\'94\
\'93Quite so,\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I see your point of\
\
 view. At the same time winter is coming on fast. Before long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult\'97even for elves I imagine. Also there will be other difficulties. You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?\'94\
\'93We have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?\'94 asked the king.\
\'93I thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got. Dain, I may tell you, is now less than two days\'92 march off, and has at least five hundred grim dwarves with him \'97a good many of them have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard. When they arrive there may be serious trouble.\'94\
\'93Why do you tell us this? Are you betraying your friends, or are you threatening us?\'94 asked Bard grimly.\
\'93My dear Bard!\'94 squeaked Bilbo. \'93Don\'92t be so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will make you an offer! !\'94\
\'93Let us hear it!\'94 they said.\
\'93You may see it!\'94 said he. \'93It is this!\'94 and he drew forth the Arkenstone, and threw away the wrapping.\
The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up\
\
 in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars.\
\'93This is the Arkenstone of Thrain,\'94 said Bilbo, \'93the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. It will aid you in your bargaining.\'94 Then Bilbo, not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it in his hand, as though dazed.\
\'93But how is it yours to give?\'94 he asked at last with an effort.\
\'93O well!\'94 said the hobbit uncomfortably. \'93It isn\'92t exactly; but, well, I am willing to let it stand against all my claim, don\'92t you know. I may be a burglar\'97or so they say: personally I never really felt like one\'97but I am an honest one, I hope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. I hope you will find it useful.\'94\
The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder. \'93Bilbo Baggins!\'94 he said. \'93You are more worthy to wear the armour of elf-princes than many that have looked more comely in it. But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps. I advise you to remain\
\
 with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome.\'94\
\'93Thank you very much I am sure,\'94 said Bilbo with a bow. \'93But I don\'92t think I ought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at midnight, too! Really I must be going, and quickly.\'94\
Nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as he went both the king and Bard saluted him with honour. As they passed through the camp an old man, wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door where he was sitting and came towards them.\
\'93Well done! Mr. Baggins!\'94 he said, clapping Bilbo on the back. \'93There is always more about you than anyone expects!\'94 It was Gandalf.\
For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask.\
\'93All in good time!\'94 said Gandalf. \'93Things are drawing towards the end now, unless I am mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep your heart up! You may come through all right. There is news brewing that even the ravens have not heard. Good night!\'94\
Puzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set across dry,\
\
 and then he said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before midnight when he clambered up the rope again\'97it was still where he had left it. He untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously what would happen next.\
At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without listening to the old dwarf\'92s thanks (which he felt he had hardly earned). He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning. As a matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon.\

  \
 THE CLOUDS BURST\
 Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed.\
\'93That will be Dain!\'94 said Thorin when he heard. \'93They will have got wind of his coming. I thought that would alter their mood! Bid them come few in number and weaponless, and I will hear,\'94 he called to the messenger.\
About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company of twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the narrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and came on towards the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and\
\
 hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound wood. \'93Hail Thorin!\'94 said Bard. \'93Are you still of the\
same mind?\'94\
\'93My mind does not change with the rising\
and setting of a few suns,\'94 answered Thorin. \'93Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has not departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain to bargain with me.\'94\
\'93Is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?\'94\
\'93Nothing that you or your friends have to offer.\'94\
\'93What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?\'94 said he, and at the same moment the old man opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the morning.\
Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke for a long while.\
Thorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with wrath. \'93That stone was my father\'92s, and is mine,\'94 he said. \'93Why should I purchase my own?\'94 But wonder overcame him and he added: \'93But how came you by the heirloom of my house\'97if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?\'94\
\'93We are not thieves,\'94 Bard answered. \'93Your own we will give back in return for our own.\'94\
\
 \'93How came you by it?\'94 shouted Thorin in gathering rage.\
\'93I gave it to them!\'94 squeaked Bilbo, who was peering over the wall, by now in a dreadful fright.\
\'93You! You!\'94 cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. \'93You miserable hobbit! You undersized\'97burglar!\'94 he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit.\
\'93By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!\'94 he cried and lifted Bilbo in his arms.\
\'93Stay! Your wish is granted!\'94 said a voice. The old man with the casket threw aside his hood and cloak. \'93Here is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you don\'92t like my Burglar, please don\'92t damage him. Put him down, and listen first to what he has to say!\'94\
\'93You all seem in league!\'94 said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall. \'93Never again will I have dealings with any wizard or his friends. What have you to say, you descendant of rats?\'94\
\'93Dear me! Dear me!\'94 said Bilbo. \'93I am sure this is all very uncomfortable. You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally\
\
 \'97I have been told that dwarves are sometimes politer in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you seemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this all the service of you and your family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share as I wished, and let it go at that!\'94\
\'93I will,\'94 said Thorin grimly. \'93And I will let you go at that\'97and may we never meet again!\'94 Then he turned and spoke over the wall. \'93I am betrayed,\'94 he said. \'93It was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of this traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He will get little enough, I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live; and no friendship of mine goes with him.\
\'93Get down now to your friends!\'94 he said to Bilbo, \'93or I will throw you down.\'94\
\'93What about the gold and silver?\'94 asked Bilbo.\
\'93That shall follow after, as can be arranged,\'94 said he. \'93Get down!\'94\
\'93Until then we keep the stone,\'94 cried Bard. \'93You are not making a very splendid figure\
\
 as King under the Mountain,\'94 said Gandalf. \'93But things may change yet.\'94\
\'93They may indeed,\'94 said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward.\
And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than one of the dwarves in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going.\
\'93Farewell!\'94 he cried to them. \'93We may meet again as friends.\'94\
\'93Be off!\'94 called Thorin. \'93You have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too good for you. It cannot be pierced by arrows; but if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!\'94\
\'93Not so hasty!\'94 said Bard. \'93We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf- host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!\'94\
With that they went back to the camp; but\
\
 Thorin sent messengers by Ro\'e4c telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.\
That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain\'92s people. The dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong even for dwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had also a short broad sword at his side and a roundshield slung at his back. Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.\
Trumpets called men and elves to arms.\
\
 Before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the valley at a great pace. They halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their hands in sign of peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo.\
\'93We are sent from Dain son of Nain,\'94 they said when questioned. \'93We are hastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended walls?\'94 This, of course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, meant simply: \'93You have no business here. We are going on, so make way or we shall fight you!\'94 They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the river; for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded.\
Bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. He was determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the Arkenstone; for he did not believe that this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company. They had brought with them a great store of supplies; for\
\
 the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, and nearly all of Dain\'92s folk, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge packs on their backs in addition to their weapons. They would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not sufficient numbers.\
These were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. Arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of Dain were advancing along the eastern bank.\
\'93Fools!\'94 laughed Bard, \'93to come thus beneath the Mountain\'92s arm! They do not understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. There are many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks upon their right flank. Dwarf-mail\
\
 may be good, but they will soon be hard put to it. Let us set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!\'94\
But the Elvenking said: \'93Long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows.\'94\
But he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone was in the hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the hesitation of Bard and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated.\
Suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined.\
Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit its peak. And beneath the thunder another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings.\
\
 \'93Halt!\'94 cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. \'93Halt!\'94 he called in a voice like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. \'93Dread has come upon you all! Alas! it has come more swiftly than I guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg* of the North is coming, O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his army like a sea of locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!\'94\
Amazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. The elves cried out with many voices.\
\'93Come!\'94 called Gandalf. \'93There is yet time for council. Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to us!\'94\
So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their\
 \
 race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon the South. Then they learned of the death of Smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault.\
This is the plan that he made in council with the Elven-king and with Bard; and with Dain, for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms\
\
 of the Mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no time to make any other plan, or to summon any help.\
Soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the South-East; but the bat-cloud came, flying lower, over the shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light and filling them with dread.\
\'93To the Mountain!\'94 called Bard. \'93To the Mountain! Let us take our places while there is yet time!\'94\
On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain\'92s feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur\'92s end and came rushing into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before the rest\
\
 drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had gathered behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their banners were countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.\
It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo\'92s experiences, and the one which at the time he hated most\'97which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman.\
The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them. As soon as the host of their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each\
\
 flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were stained black with goblin blood.\
Just as the goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rose from across the valley a deep- throated roar. With cries of \'93Moria!\'94 and \'93Dain, Dain!\'94 the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and beside them came the men of the Lake with long swords.\
Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed numbers. Already many of the goblins were flying back down the river to escape from the trap; and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above.\
Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs from above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass of the Mountain in the centre;\
\
 and the defenders had too few to bar the way for long. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide.\
Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs came ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.\
Suddenly there was a great shout, and from the Gate came a trumpet call. They had forgotten Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his companions followed him. Hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining armour, and red light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire.\
Rocks were hurled down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on, leapt down to the falls\'92 foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell or fled before them. Thorin\
\
 wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him.\
\'93To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!\'94 he cried, and his voice shook like a horn in the valley.\
Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too came many of the Lake-men, for Bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side came many of the spearmen of the elves. Once again the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous with their corpses. The Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right against the bodyguard of Bolg. But he could not pierce their ranks.\
Already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. Their friends could not help them, for the assault from the Mountain\
\
 was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly beaten down.\
On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves\'97 partly because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end.\
That did not seem far off. \'93It will not be long now,\'94 thought Bilbo, \'93before the goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out of it.\'94\
\
 The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round. He gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against the distant glow.\
\'93The Eagles! The Eagles!\'94 he shouted. \'93The Eagles are coming!\'94\
Bilbo\'92s eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North.\
\'93The Eagles! the Eagles!\'94 Bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms. If the elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley. Many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet nothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain.\
\'93The Eagles!\'94 cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more.\
Chapter 1\
A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY\
When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\
Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.\
\'91It will have to be paid for,\'92 they said. \'91It isn\'92t natural, and trouble will come of it!\'92\
But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to for- give him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.\
\
28 the fellowship of the ring\
The eldest of these, and Bilbo\'92s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. \'91You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,\'92 said Bilbo one day; \'91and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.\'92 At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.\
Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very re- spectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an important number: the date of his \'91coming of age\'92.\
Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.\
No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his young- est son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.\
\'91A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I\'92ve always said,\'92 the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him \'91Master Hamfast\'92, and\
\
a long-expected party 29\
consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables \'96 in the matter of \'91roots\'92, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbour- hood (including himself).\
\'91But what about this Frodo that lives with him?\'92 asked Old Noakes of Bywater. \'91Baggins is his name, but he\'92s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.\'92\
\'91And no wonder they\'92re queer,\'92 put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer\'92s next-door neighbour), \'91if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That\'92s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.\'92\
\'91You\'92re right, Dad!\'92 said the Gaffer. \'91Not that the Brandy- bucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they\'92re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river \'96 and that isn\'92t natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.\'92\
\'91Drownded?\'92 said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again.\
\'91Well, so they say,\'92 said the Gaffer. \'91You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo\'92s first cousin on the mother\'92s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took\'92s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out\
\
30 the fellowship of the ring\
boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.\'92\
\'91I\'92ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,\'92 said Old Noakes; \'91and it was Drogo\'92s weight as sunk the boat.\'92\
\'91And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,\'92 said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\
\'91You shouldn\'92t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,\'92 said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. \'91There isn\'92t no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.\
\'91But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville- Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won\'92t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.\'92\
\'91There\'92s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,\'92 said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. \'91All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I\'92ve heard.\'92\
\'91Then you\'92ve heard more than I can speak to,\'92 answered the Gaffer. \'91I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I\'92d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad\'92s cousin), but he\
\
a long-expected party 31\
had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from tram- pling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don\'92t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn\'92t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He\'92s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days, he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo\'92s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters \'96 meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.\
\'91Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don\'92t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you\'92ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say it to others,\'92 he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.\
But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo\'92s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.\
\'91Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,\'92 argued the miller, voicing common opinion. \'91He\'92s often away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End\'92s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.\'92\
\'91And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,\'92 retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. \'91If that\'92s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There\'92s some not far away that wouldn\'92t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone\'92s going to be invited to the party, and there\'92s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all \'96 this very month as is.\'92\

That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks \'96 fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.\
Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbi- ton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandy- wine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit- children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo\'92s front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G   and the elf-rune,   .\
That was Gandalf\'92s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the \'91attractions\'92 at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. \'91G for Grand!\'92 they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays \'96 they now belonged to a legendary past.\
When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but\
\
a long-expected party 33\
not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the dis- appointment of the onlookers.\
\'91Run away now!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You will get plenty when the time comes.\'92 Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.\
Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.\
\'91How bright your garden looks!\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.\'92\
\'91You mean to go on with your plan then?\'92\
\'91I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven\'92t changed it.\'92\
\'91Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan \'96 your whole plan, mind \'96 and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of us.\'92\
\'91I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.\'92\
\'91Who will laugh, I wonder?\'92 said Gandalf, shaking his head. \'91We shall see,\'92 said Bilbo.\
The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have been some grumbling about \'91dealing locally\'92, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.\
Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the\
\
34 the fellowship of the ring\
Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post- office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.\
A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admit- tance except on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf \'92s arrival he remained hidden from view.\
One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo\'92s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.\
The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits\'92 mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.\
Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.\
Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident,\
\
a long-expected party 35\
but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry \'96 the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody\'92s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.\
On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magi- cal. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.\
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking \'96 continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.\
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf- fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.\
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark\
\
36 the fellowship of the ring\
smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon \'96 not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.\
\'91That is the signal for supper!\'92 said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.\
\
a long-expected party 37\
There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (re- lations of Bilbo Baggins\'92 grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation.\
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleas- ant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo\'92s catering had depleted the stocks of most of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.\
After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called \'91filling up the corners\'92. They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.\
My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. \'91Hear! Hear! Hear!\'92 they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the\
\
38 the fellowship of the ring\
golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.\
My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Good- bodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. \'91Proudfeet!\'92 shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.\
Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! \'91Hurray! Hur- ray! Many Happy Returns!\'92 they shouted, and they ham- mered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.\
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deaf- ening cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hun- dreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was neces- sary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.\
But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I have called you all together for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There was almost\
\
a long-expected party 39\
silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.\
Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of approval.\
I don\'92t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.\
Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of \'91Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,\'92 from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what was meant by \'91coming into his inheritance\'92.\
Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package. \'91One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.\'92\
It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say \'91thag you very buch\'92. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now immi- nent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn\'92t he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.\
Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an\
\
40 the fellowship of the ring\
ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret to announce that \'96 though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you \'96 this is the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!\
He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty- four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.\
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. \'91He\'92s mad. I always said so,\'92 was probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo\'92s behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.\
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: \'91There\'92s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn\'92t taken the vittles with him.\'92 He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.\
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo\'92s empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins\'92 oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-\
\
a long-expected party 41\
Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.\
As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.\
He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the enve- lope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.\
\'91Hullo!\'92 said Bilbo. \'91I wondered if you would turn up.\'92\
\'91I am glad to find you visible,\'92 replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, \'91I wanted to catch you and have a few\
\
42 the fellowship of the ring\
final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?\'92\
\'91Yes, I do,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I suppose?\'92\
\'91It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.\'92\
\'91And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busy- body,\'92 laughed Bilbo, \'91but I expect you know best, as usual.\'92 \'91I do \'96 when I know anything. But I don\'92t feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going\
any further?\'92\
\'91Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as\
I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don\'92t expect I shall return. In fact, I don\'92t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.\
\'91I am old, Gandalf. I don\'92t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!\'92 he snorted. \'91Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can\'92t be right. I need a change, or something.\'92\
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. \'91No, it does not seem right,\'92 he said thoughtfully. \'91No, after all I believe your plan is probably the best.\'92\
\'91Well, I\'92ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see moun- tains again, Gandalf \'96 mountains; and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.\'92\
Gandalf laughed. \'91I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.\'92\
\
a long-expected party 43\
\'91Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone. You\'92ll keep an eye on Frodo, won\'92t you?\'92\
\'91Yes, I will \'96 two eyes, as often as I can spare them.\'92\
\'91He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It\'92s time he was his own master now.\'92\
\'91Everything?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.\'92\
\'91Well, er, yes, I suppose so,\'92 stammered Bilbo.\
\'91Where is it?\'92\
\'91In an envelope, if you must know,\'92 said Bilbo impatiently.\
\'91There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!\'92 He hesitated. \'91Isn\'92t that odd now?\'92 he said softly to himself. \'91Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn\'92t it stay there?\'92\
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes. \'91I think, Bilbo,\'92 he said quietly, \'91I should leave it behind. Don\'92t you want to?\'92\
\'91Well yes \'96 and no. Now it comes to it, I don\'92t like parting with it at all, I may say. And I don\'92t really see why I should. Why do you want me to?\'92 he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoy- ance. \'91You are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.\'92\
\'91No, but I had to badger you,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I wanted the truth. It was important. Magic rings are \'96 well, magical; and they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have\
\
44 the fellowship of the ring\
had it quite long enough. You won\'92t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.\'92\
Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. \'91Why not?\'92 he cried. \'91And what business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.\'92\
\'91Yes, yes,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there is no need to get angry.\'92\
\'91If I am it is your fault,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91It is mine, I tell you. My own. My Precious. Yes, my Precious.\'92\
The wizard\'92s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. \'91It has been called that before,\'92 he said, \'91but not by you.\'92\
\'91But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It\'92s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.\'92\
Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. \'91You will be a fool if you do, Bilbo,\'92 he said. \'91You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.\'92\
\'91I\'92ll do as I choose and go as I please,\'92 said Bilbo obstinately.\
\'91Now, now, my dear hobbit!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91All your long life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up!\'92\
\'91Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!\'92 cried Bilbo. \'91But you won\'92t get it. I won\'92t give my Precious away, I tell you.\'92 His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.\
Gandalf\'92s eyes flashed. \'91It will be my turn to get angry soon,\'92 he said. \'91If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.\'92 He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.\
Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf\'92s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.\

\'91I don\'92t know what has come over you, Gandalf,\'92 he said. \'91You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn\'92t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn\'92t kept it. I\'92m not a thief, whatever he said.\'92\
\'91I have never called you one,\'92 Gandalf answered. \'91And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.\'92 He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.\
Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. \'91I am sorry,\'92 he said. \'91But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don\'92t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn\'92t rest without it in my pocket. I don\'92t know why. And I don\'92t seem able to make up my mind.\'92\
\'91Then trust mine,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.\'92\
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. \'91All right,\'92 he said with an effort. \'91I will.\'92 Then he shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. \'91After all that\'92s what this party business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday-presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn\'92t made it any easier in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.\'92\
\'91Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91Very well,\'92 said Bilbo, \'91it goes to Frodo with all the rest.\'92 He drew a deep breath. \'91And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn\'92t bear to do it all over again.\'92 He picked up his bag and moved to the door.\
\'91You have still got the ring in your pocket,\'92 said the wizard.\
\
46 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Well, so I have!\'92 cried Bilbo. \'91And my will and all the other documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.\'92\
\'91No, don\'92t give the ring to me,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Put it on the mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.\'92\
Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit\'92s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.\
\'91Well, that\'92s that,\'92 he said. \'91Now I\'92m off !\'92\
They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy.\
\'91Is everything ready?\'92 asked Bilbo. \'91Everything packed and labelled?\'92\
\'91Everything,\'92 they answered.\
\'91Well, let\'92s start then!\'92 He stepped out of the front-door. It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars.\
He looked up, sniffing the air. \'91What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye!\'92 he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. \'91Good-bye, Gandalf !\'92\
\'91Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.\'92\
\'91Take care! I don\'92t care. Don\'92t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,\'92 he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:\
The Road goes ever on and on\
Down from the door where it began.\
Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can,\
\
a long-expected party 47\
Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it joins some larger way\
Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.\
He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents, and followed by his three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass.\
Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. \'91Good-bye, my dear Bilbo \'96 until our next meet- ing!\'92 he said softly and went back indoors.\
Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought. \'91Has he gone?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Yes,\'92 answered Gandalf, \'91he has gone at last.\'92\
\'91I wish \'96 I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.\'92\
\'91I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Don\'92t be too troubled. He\'92ll be all right \'96 now. He left a packet for you. There it is!\'92\
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.\
\'91You\'92ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,\'92 said the wizard. \'91You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, you\'92ll find a golden ring.\'92\
\'91The ring!\'92 exclaimed Frodo. \'91Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be useful.\'92\
\'91It may, and it may not,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I should not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.\'92\

As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. About mid- night carriages came for the important folk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel- barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.\
Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handker- chiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the best- fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.\
Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: \'91Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.\'92 Some of the visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left \'91messages\'92 for them.\
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were several labels of this sort:\
For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.\
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspon- dence, with love from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo\'92s sister and the eldest surviving female rela- tive of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.\
\
a long-expected party 49\
For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.; on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.\
For ANGELICA\'92S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously con- sidered her face shapely.\
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a con- tributor; on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning them.\
For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT; on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took the spoons.\
This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo\'92s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always new; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.\
Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the South- farthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo\'92s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle.\
\

There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor mention of money or jewel- lery: not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.\
Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts.\
In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.\
\'91He is indisposed,\'92 he said. \'91He is resting.\'92\
\'91Hiding, you mean,\'92 said Lobelia. \'91Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!\'92\
Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed \'96 to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.\
The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.\
\'91Only one thing is clear to me,\'92 said Otho, \'91and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.\'92\
\
a long-expected party 51\
Otho would have been Bilbo\'92s heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).\
\'91Foiled again!\'92 he said to his wife. \'91And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!\'92 He snapped his fingers under Frodo\'92s nose and stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on, and found her still about the place, investigating nooks and corners, and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:\
\'91You\'92ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn\'92t you go too? You don\'92t belong here; you\'92re no Baggins \'96 you \'96 you\'92re a Brandybuck!\'92\
\'91Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,\'92 said Frodo as he shut the door on her.\
\'91It was a compliment,\'92 said Merry Brandybuck, \'91and so, of course, not true.\'92\
Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot\'92s grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo\'92s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows, anyone\'92s for the finding \'96 unless the search is interrupted.\
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. \'91It\'92s time to close the shop, Merry,\'92 he said. \'91Lock the door, and don\'92t open it to\
\
52 the fellowship of the ring\
anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.\'92 Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.\
He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. \'91Lobelia again most likely,\'92 he thought. \'91She must have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.\'92\
He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard\'92s head appeared at the window.\
\'91If you don\'92t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill,\'92 he said.\
\'91My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!\'92 cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door. \'91Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.\'92\
\'91Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.\'92\
\'91She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo\'92s ring. I longed to disappear.\'92\
\'91Don\'92t do that!\'92 said Gandalf, sitting down. \'91Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last word.\'92\
\'91Well, what about it?\'92\
\'91What do you know already?\'92\
\'91Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he\
found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.\'92 \'91Which story, I wonder,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,\'92\
said Frodo. \'91He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. \'91\'91No secrets between us, Frodo,\'92\'92 he said; \'91\'91but they are not to go any further. It\'92s mine anyway.\'92\'92 \'92\
\'91That\'92s interesting,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Well, what did you think of it all?\'92\
\'91If you mean, inventing all that about a \'91\'91present\'92\'92, well, I thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn\'92t see\
\
a long-expected party 53\
the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather odd.\'92\
\'91So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures \'96 if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t understand,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Neither do I,\'92 answered the wizard. \'91I have merely begun to wonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!\'92\
\'91You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of ?\'92\
\'91I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for the present.\'92 He got up.\
\'91At once!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I was looking forward to your help.\'92\
\'91I did mean to \'96 but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I\'92ll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan\'92t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actu- ally accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.\'92\
\'91Some people!\'92 exclaimed Frodo. \'91You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else, if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.\'92\
\'91So do I,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!\'92\

Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.\
\
Chapter 2\
THE SHADOW OF THE PAST\
The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was dis- cussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten.\
But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbour- hood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.\
\'91If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he\'92ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,\'92 they said. And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo\'92s reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo\'92s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called a Hundred- weight Feast. But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say.\
Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo\'92s Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said that he did not think Bilbo was\
\
56 the fellowship of the ring\
dead. When they asked: \'91Where is he then?\'92 he shrugged his shoulders.\
He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.\
As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good \'91preservation\'92: outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. \'91Some folk have all the luck,\'92 they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.\
Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams. He began to say to himself: \'91Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.\'92 To which the other half of his mind always replied: \'91Not yet.\'92\
So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too\
\
the shadow of the past 57\
well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.\
There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient East\'96West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits\'92 chief source of news from distant parts \'96 if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.\
That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name.\

\

Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo\'92s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.\
Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the miller\'92s son; and there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk.\
\'91Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,\'92 said Sam.\
\'91Ah,\'92 said Ted, \'91you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside- tales and children\'92s stories at home, if I want to.\'92\
\'91No doubt you can,\'92 retorted Sam, \'91and I daresay there\'92s more truth in some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take dragons now.\'92\
\'91No thank \'92ee,\'92 said Ted, \'91I won\'92t. I heard tell of them when I was a youngster, but there\'92s no call to believe in them now. There\'92s only one Dragon in Bywater, and that\'92s Green,\'92 he said, getting a general laugh.\
\'91All right,\'92 said Sam, laughing with the rest. \'91But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.\'92\
\'91Who\'92s they?\'92\
\'91My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.\'92\
\'91Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal\'92s always saying he\'92s seen things; and maybe he sees things that ain\'92t there.\'92\
\'91But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking \'96 walking seven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.\'92\
\'91Then I bet it wasn\'92t an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as not.\'92\
\'91But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain\'92t no elm tree on the North Moors.\'92\
\
the shadow of the past 59\
\'91Then Hal can\'92t have seen one,\'92 said Ted. There was some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point.\
\'91All the same,\'92 said Sam, \'91you can\'92t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire \'96 crossing it, mind you: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never been so busy before.\
\'91And I\'92ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.\'92 Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return.\
\'91They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into the West and leaving us,\'92 said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.\
\'91Well, that isn\'92t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I don\'92t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven\'92t seen them doing it; nor anyone else in the Shire.\'92\
\'91Well, I don\'92t know,\'92 said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. \'91There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them,\'92 he said. \'91There\'92s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many\'92s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.\'92\
\'91Oh, they\'92re both cracked,\'92 said Ted. \'91Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo\'92s cracking. If that\'92s where you get your news from, you\'92ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I\'92m off home. Your good health!\'92 He drained his mug and went out noisily.\

Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.\
It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.\
It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo\'92s health and doings.\
Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.\
Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at one another.\
\'91All well eh?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You look the same as ever, Frodo!\'92\
\'91So do you,\'92 Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night.\
Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire\
\
the shadow of the past 61\
was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees\'92 fingers.\
Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a hand- kerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.\
He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.\
\'91Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,\'92 he said. \'91And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight. Don\'92t you think you had better finish now? You say the ring is danger- ous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?\'92\
\'91In many ways,\'92 answered the wizard. \'91It is far more power- ful than I ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.\
\'91In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles \'96 yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous.\
\'91A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings.\
\
62 the fellowship of the ring\
Yes, sooner or later \'96 later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last \'96 sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.\'92\
\'91How terrifying!\'92 said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.\
\'91How long have you known this?\'92 asked Frodo at length. \'91And how much did Bilbo know?\'92\
\'91Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or queer, it was himself. He said that it was \'91\'91growing on his mind\'92\'92, and he was always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.\'92\
\'91Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,\'92 said Frodo, \'91so I have always kept it on its chain.\'92\
\'91Very wise,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy. Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.\'92\
\'91How long have you known all this?\'92 asked Frodo again.\
\'91Known?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean \'91\'91known about this ring\'92\'92, well, I still do not know, one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.\
\'91When did I first begin to guess?\'92 he mused, searching back in memory. \'91Let me see \'96 it was in the year that the White Council drove the Dark Power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow\
\
the shadow of the past 63\
fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was \'96 that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo\'92s strange story of how he had \'91\'91won\'92\'92 it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his \'91\'91birthday- present\'92\'92. The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held me back.\'92\
\'91Who is he?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91I have never heard of him before.\'92\
\'91Maybe not,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91Hobbits are, or were, no concern of his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings were debated in the Coun- cil, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept \'96 but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.\
\'91And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they passed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: \'91\'91After all he comes of a long-lived family on his mother\'92s side. There is time yet. Wait!\'92\'92\
\'91And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could allay. I knew at last that something\
\
64 the fellowship of the ring\
dark and deadly was at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.\'92\
\'91There wasn\'92t any permanent harm done, was there?\'92 asked Frodo anxiously. \'91He would get all right in time, wouldn\'92t he? Be able to rest in peace, I mean?\'92\
\'91He felt better at once,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe. I don\'92t think you need worry about Bilbo.\
\'91Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off \'96 before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for you that I feel responsible.\
\'91Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.\'92\
Frodo shuddered. \'91But why should we be?\'92 he asked. \'91And why should he want such slaves?\'92\
\'91To tell you the truth,\'92 replied Gandalf, \'91I believe that hitherto \'96 hitherto, mark you \'96 he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you \'96 he has many more useful servants \'96 but he won\'92t forget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than\
\
the shadow of the past 65\
hobbits happy and free. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.\'92\
\'91Revenge?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Revenge for what? I still don\'92t understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.\'92\
\'91It has everything to do with it,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You do not know the real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.\'92\
Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluc- tant for Gandalf to touch it.\
Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. \'91Can you see any markings on it?\'92 he asked.\
\'91No,\'92 said Frodo. \'91There are none. It is quite plain, and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear.\'92\
\'91Well then, look!\'92 To Frodo\'92s astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back.\
\'91Wait!\'92 he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows.\
No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam\'92s shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped.\
\'91It is quite cool,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Take it!\'92 Frodo received it on his shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever.\
\'91Hold it up!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91And look closely!\'92\
\
66 the fellowship of the ring\
As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.\
\'91I cannot read the fiery letters,\'92 said Frodo in a quavering voice.\
\'91No,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient mode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:\
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\
It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:\
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,\
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,\
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne\
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,\
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them\
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.\'92\
He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: \'91This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening\
 \
the shadow of the past 67\
of his power. He greatly desires it \'96 but he must not get it.\'92 Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him. \'91This ring!\'92 he stammered. \'91How, how on\
earth did it come to me?\'92\
\'91Ah!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91That is a very long story. The begin- nings lie back in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed into Winter.\
\'91But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another shape and grows again.\'92\
\'91I wish it need not have happened in my time,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91So do I,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.\
\'91The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.\
\'91The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most\
\
68 the fellowship of the ring\
terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire.\
\'91So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no longer troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever.\
\'91And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and our great fear.\'92\
\'91Why, why wasn\'92t it destroyed?\'92 cried Frodo. \'91And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?\'92 He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it.\
\'91It was taken from him,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91The strength of the Elves to resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged from them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.\
\'91But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil\'92s son cut the Ring\
\
the shadow of the past 69\
from Sauron\'92s hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.\
\'91But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and vanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him with arrows.\'92\
Gandalf paused. \'91And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,\'92 he said, \'91the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of its history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think.\
\'91Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever-handed and quiet-footed little people. I guess they were of hobbit- kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise 
\f1 in old lore, such as they had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Sme\uc0\u32 \u769 agol. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and
\f0  he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91He had a friend called De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol, of similar sort, sharper- eyed but not so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There Sme\u32 \u769 agol got out and went nosing about the banks but De\u32 \u769 agol sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
70 the fellowship of the ring\
knew where he was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; and holding his breath he grabbed at it.\
\'91Then up he came splu
\f1 ttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, there in his hand lay a beauti- ful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad. But Sme\uc0\u32 \u769 agol had been watching him from behind a tree, and as De\u32 \u769 agol gloated over the ring, Sme\u32 \u769 agol came softly up behind.\
\'91\'91\'91Give us that, De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol, my love,\'92\'92 said Sme\u32 \u769 agol, over his friend\'92s shoulder.\
\'91 \'91\'91Why?\'92\'92 said De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol.\

\f0 \'91 \'91\'91Because it\'92s my birthday, my love, a
\f1 nd I wants it,\'92\'92 said Sme\uc0\u32 \u769  agol.\
\'91\'91\'91I don\'92t care,\'92\'92 said De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol. \'91\'91I have given you a present already, more than I could afford. I found this, and I\'92m going to keep it.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91Oh, are you indeed, my love,\'92\'92 said Sme\uc0\u32 \u769 agol; and he caught De\u32 \u769 agol by the th
\f0 roat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91No one ever found out what had become of De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol; he was murdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Sme\u32 \u769 agol returned alone;
\f0  and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when vis- ible) by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to thieving, and going about muttering to him- self, and gurgling in his throat. So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grand-\
\
the shadow of the past 71\
mother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole.\
\'91He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hard- ness of the world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head, and a dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her.\
\'91But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far ahead the tops of the Misty Mountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: \'91\'91It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.\'92\'92\
\'91So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothing of it.\'92\
\'91Gollum!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!\'92\
\'91I think it is a sad story,\'92 said the wizard, \'91and it might have happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.\'92 \'91I can\'92t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,\'92 said Frodo with some heat. \'91What an\
abominable notion!\'92\
\'91It is true all the same,\'92 replied Gandalf. \'91About their\
origins, at any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo\'92s story suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories\
\
72 the fellowship of the ring\
that was very similar. They understood one another remark- ably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for one thing.\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and of much the same sort. And hobbits don\'92t cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.\'92\
\'91Only too true, I fear,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there was some- thing else in it, I think, which you don\'92t see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed \'96 as a hobbit might. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things.\
\'91But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end \'96 unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.\'92 Gandalf sighed. \'91Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never \'91\'91faded\'92\'92. He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable.\
\'91All the \'91\'91great secrets\'92\'92 under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Surely the Ring was his Precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn\'92t he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?\'92\
\
the shadow of the past 73\
\'91You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.\
\'91A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone else\'92s care \'96 and that only at an early stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him.\'92\
\'91What, just in time to meet Bilbo?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Wouldn\'92t an Orc have suited it better?\'92\
\'91It is no laughing matter,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Not for you. It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo\'92s arrival just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.\

\f1 \'91There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur\'92s hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol, and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devou
\f0 red him. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!\
\'91Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought.\'92\
\'91It is not,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Though I am not sure that I under- stand you. But how have you learned all this about the Ring,\
\

and about Gollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?\'92\
Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. \'91I knew much and I have learned much,\'92 he answered. \'91But I am not going to give an account of all my doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire- writing alone, apart from any other evidence.\'92\
\'91And when did you discover that?\'92 asked Frodo, inter- rupting.\
\'91Just now in this room, of course,\'92 answered the wizard sharply. \'91But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum\'92s part, and fitting it into the gap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.\'92\
\'91You have seen Gollum?\'92 exclaimed Frodo in amazement.\
\'91Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long ago; but I have managed it at last.\'92\
\'91Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?\'92\
\'91Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell \'96 though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a liar, and you
\f1  have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his \'91\'91birthday-present\'92\'92, and he stuck to that. He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Sme\uc0\u32 \u769 agol\'92s grandmother 
\f0 was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of truth.\

\f1 \'91The murder of De\uc0\u32 \u769 agol haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, repeating it to his \'91\'91Precious\'92\'92 over and over again, as he gnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it. It was his birthday. De\u32 \u769 agol ought to have given the ring to him. It had obviously turned up just so as to be\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
the shadow of the past 75\
a present. It was his birthday-present, and so on, and on.\
\'91I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desper- ately important, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo\'92s escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was going to get his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed\
his name. What is more, he knew where he came from.\'92 \'91But how did he find that out?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum\
himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.\
\'91Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into Mirkwood, as one would expect.\'92\
\'91Is that where you found him?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I saw him there,\'92 answered Gandalf, \'91but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo\'92s trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain, for his talk was con- stantly interrupted by curses and threats. \'91\'91What had it got\
\
76 the fellowship of the ring\
in its pocketses?\'92\'92 he said. \'91\'91It wouldn\'92t say, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!\'92\'92\
\'91That is a sample of his talk. I don\'92t suppose you want any more. I had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo\'92s name and knew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West. Gollum\'92s sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.\'92\
\'91Then why didn\'92t he track Bilbo further?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91Why didn\'92t he come to the Shire?\'92\
\'91Ah,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.\
\'91The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though they never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.\
\'91But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves\'92 ken, and was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman.\
\'91Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I\
\
the shadow of the past 77\
took it up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other paths, Gollum was found. My friend returned out of great perils bringing the miserable creature with him.\
\'91What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.\'92\
A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam\'92s shears could now be heard.\
\'91Yes, to Mordor,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!\
\'91Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would be caught, and taken \'96 for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief was done.\
\'91Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that it is not one\
\
78 the fellowship of the ring\
of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and the Shire.\
\'91The Shire \'96 he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.\'92\
\'91But this is terrible!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!\'92\
\'91Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.\'92\
\'91I am sorry,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.\'92\
\'91You have not seen him,\'92 Gandalf broke in.\
\'91No, and I don\'92t want to,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I can\'92t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.\'92\
\'91Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judge- ment. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many \'96 yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.\'92\
\
the shadow of the past 79\
\'91All the same,\'92 said Frodo, \'91even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn\'92t you make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?\'92\
\'91Let you? Make you?\'92 said the wizard. \'91Haven\'92t you been listening to all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of being found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself.\
\'91Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some risk \'96 though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.\'92\
\'91But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?\'92 cried Frodo again. \'91If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would have done away with it.\'92\
\'91Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?\'92 \'91No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.\'92 \'91Try!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Try now!\'92\
Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and\
\
80 the fellowship of the ring\
forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away \'96 but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.\
Gandalf laughed grimly. \'91You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not \'91\'91make\'92\'92 you \'96 except by force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is useless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.\
\'91Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there is no smith\'92s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.\
\'91There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.\'92\
\'91I do really wish to destroy it!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?\'92\
\'91Such questions cannot be answered,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.\'92\
\'91But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you not take the Ring?\'92\
\'91No!\'92 cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. \'91With that power\
\
the shadow of the past 81\
I should have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.\'92 His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within. \'91Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie before me.\'92\
He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along the path outside whistling. \'91And now,\'92 said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, \'91the decision lies with you. But I will always help you.\'92 He laid his hand on Frodo\'92s shoulder. \'91I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.\'92\
There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and the terror of the Fiery Mountain.\
\'91Well!\'92 said Gandalf at last. \'91What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?\'92\
\'91No!\'92 answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of dark- ness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the sunlit garden. \'91Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me.\'92\
\'91Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91I hope so,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that\
\
82 the fellowship of the ring\
I am a danger, a danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.\'92 He sighed.\
\'91I should like to save the Shire, if I could \'96 though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I don\'92t feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.\
\'91Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo\'92s or better, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well \'96 desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.\'92\
He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart \'96 to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago.\
\'91My dear Frodo!\'92 exclaimed Gandalf. \'91Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.\
\
the shadow of the past 83\
\'91But I don\'92t think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side \'96 and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.\'92\
Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee\'92s curly head hauled by one ear.\
\'91Well, well, bless my beard!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Sam Gamgee is it? Now what may you be doing?\'92\
\'91Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!\'92 said Sam. \'91Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.\'92 He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.\
\'91I don\'92t,\'92 said Gandalf grimly. \'91It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?\'92\
\'91Eavesdropping, sir? I don\'92t follow you, begging your pardon. There ain\'92t no eaves at Bag End, and that\'92s a fact.\'92\
\'91Don\'92t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?\'92 Gandalf\'92s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.\
\'91Mr. Frodo, sir!\'92 cried Sam quaking. \'91Don\'92t let him hurt me, sir! Don\'92t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!\'92\
\'91He won\'92t hurt you,\'92 said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. \'91He knows, as well as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight away!\'92\
\'91Well, sir,\'92 said Sam dithering a little. \'91I heard a deal that I didn\'92t rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and\
\
84 the fellowship of the ring\
Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and \'96 and Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn\'92t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn\'92t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?\'92\
Suddenly Gandalf laughed. \'91Come inside!\'92 he shouted, and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, right through the window and stood him on the floor. \'91Take you to see Elves, eh?\'92 he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. \'91So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?\'92\
\'91I did, sir. And that\'92s why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.\'92\
\'91It can\'92t be helped, Sam,\'92 said Frodo sadly. He had sud- denly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. \'91I shall have to go. But\'92 \'96 and here he looked hard at Sam \'96 \'91if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See? If you don\'92t, if you even breathe a word of what you\'92ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass- snakes.\'92\
Sam fell on his knees, trembling. \'91Get up, Sam!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I have thought of something better than that. Some- thing to shut your mouth, and punish you properly for listen- ing. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!\'92\
\'91Me, sir!\'92 cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. \'91Me go and see Elves and all! Hooray!\'92 he shouted, and then burst into tears.\
\
Chapter 3 THREE IS COMPANY\
\'91You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,\'92 said Gandalf. Two or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to go.\
\'91I know. But it is difficult to do both,\'92 he objected. \'91If I just vanish like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.\'92 \'91Of course you mustn\'92t vanish!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91That wouldn\'92t do at all! I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little delay. But you must\
not delay too long.\'92\
\'91What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?\'92 asked\
Frodo. \'91I think I could probably make some arrangements by then.\'92\
To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point: Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo\'92s one hundred and twenty- eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell.\
He looked at Frodo and smiled. \'91Very well,\'92 he said. \'91I think that will do \'96 but it must not be any later. I am getting very\
\
86 the fellowship of the ring\
anxious. In the meanwhile, do take care, and don\'92t let out any hint of where you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him into a toad.\'92\
\'91As for where I am going,\'92 said Frodo, \'91it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.\'92\
\'91Don\'92t be absurd!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I am not warning you against leaving an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire \'96 and that should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least set out, either North, South, West or East \'96 and the direction should cer- tainly not be known.\'92\
\'91I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of saying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,\'92 said Frodo. \'91For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose one, and not return, as far as I can see.\'92\
\'91But you cannot see very far,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Neither can I. It may be your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.\'92\
\'91No indeed!\'92 said Frodo. \'91But in the meantime what course am I to take?\'92\
\'91Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,\'92 answered the wizard. \'91If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will grow worse as the year fails.\'92\
\'91Rivendell!\'92 said Frodo. \'91Very good: I will go east, and I will make for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.\'92 He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.\
One summer\'92s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the Ivy Bush and Green Dragon. Giants and other\
\
three is company 87\
portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed he had already sold it \'96 to the Sackville-Bagginses!\
\'91For a nice bit, too,\'92 said some. \'91At a bargain price,\'92 said others, \'91and that\'92s more likely when Mistress Lobelia\'92s the buyer.\'92 (Otho had died some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)\
Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price. A few held the theory \'96 sup- ported by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself \'96 that Frodo\'92s money was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. \'91As far from the Sackville-Bagginses as may be,\'92 some added. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day, it was well known that he was \'91hiding up in the Bag End\'92. But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.\
\'91Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,\'92 he said. \'91Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.\'92\
As a matter of fact with Merry\'92s help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem credible.\
Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo\'92s plan had been\
\
88 the fellowship of the ring\
finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. \'91Only for a short while, I hope,\'92 he said. \'91But I am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.\'92\
He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. \'91Has anything happened?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the Ring. Let me impress on you once more: don\'92t use it!\'92\
He went off at dawn. \'91I may be back any day,\'92 he said. \'91At the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all you may need my company on the Road.\'92\
At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.\
Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again. September was passing and there was still no news of him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo\'92s friends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upside-down.\
On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo\'92s great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In the\
\
three is company 89\
evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled and felt in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he would break it to them.\
The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf \'92s absence. The dining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was good wine: Frodo\'92s wine had not been included in the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.\
\'91Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!\'92 said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.\
When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done together, they toasted Bilbo\'92s birthday, and they drank his health and Frodo\'92s together according to Frodo\'92s custom. Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo\'92s party was over, and Gandalf had not come.\
The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). \'91Someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive,\'92 said Merry. \'91Well, see you later \'96 the day after tomorrow, if you don\'92t go to sleep on the way!\'92\
Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going on foot. His plan \'96 for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any other reason \'96 was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it fairly easy.\
\'91I shall get myself a bit into training, too,\'92 he said, looking\
\
90 the fellowship of the ring\
at himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, he thought.\
After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo\'92s annoy- ance. \'91Ours at last!\'92 said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be for- given: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for Bag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the Gamgees\'92 in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.\
He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland \'91to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden\'92; an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.\
\'91Our last meal at Bag End!\'92 said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden. Sam dis- appeared.\
The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path, and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half\
\
three is company 91\
expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk. The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. \'91It\'92s going to be a fine night,\'92 he said aloud. \'91That\'92s good for a beginning. I feel like walking. I can\'92t bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me.\'92 He turned to go back, and then stopped, for he heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was certainly the old Gaffer\'92s; the other was strange, and some- how unpleasant. He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer\'92s answers, which were rather shrill. The old\
man seemed put out.\
\'91No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and\
my Sam went with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I tell\'92ee. Why? Why\'92s none of my business, or yours. Where to? That ain\'92t no secret. He\'92s moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is \'96 a tidy way. I\'92ve never been so far myself; they\'92re queer folks in Buckland. No, I can\'92t give no message. Good night to you!\'92\
Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief. \'91I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,\'92 he thought. \'91What an inquisitive lot they all are!\'92 He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and walked quickly back to Bag End.\
Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo stepped inside the dark door. \'91Sam!\'92 he called. \'91Sam! Time!\'92\
\'91Coming, sir!\'92 came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer-barrel in the cellar.\
\'91All aboard, Sam?\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Yes, sir. I\'92ll last for a bit now, sir.\'92\
Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key\
to Sam. \'91Run down with this to your home, Sam!\'92 he said. \'91Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at\
\
92 the fellowship of the ring\
the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes prying.\'92 Sam ran off at full speed.\
\'91Well, now we\'92re off at last!\'92 said Frodo. They shouldered their packs and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of Bag End. \'91Good-bye!\'92 said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He waved his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses.\
At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.\
\'91I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.\'92\
\'91I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,\'92 said Sam stoutly and untruthfully.\
\'91No you don\'92t, Sam!\'92 said Pippin. \'91It is good for him. He\'92s got nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He\'92s been slack lately, and he\'92ll feel the weight less when he\'92s walked off some of his own.\'92\
\'91Be kind to a poor old hobbit!\'92 laughed Frodo. \'91I shall be as thin as a willow-wand, I\'92m sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into it at our next packing.\'92 He picked up his stick again. \'91Well, we all like walking in the dark,\'92 he said, \'91so let\'92s put some miles behind us before bed.\'92\
For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again.\
\
three is company 93\
They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no noise that even hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.\
After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.\
\'91I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,\'92 he said quietly.\
When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody End, a wild corner of the Eastfarthing.\
After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they\
\
94 the fellowship of the ring\
marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and yawned.\
\'91I am so sleepy,\'92 he said, \'91that soon I shall fall down on the road. Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.\'92\
\'91I thought you liked walking in the dark,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But there is no great hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that leaves us nearly two days more. We\'92ll halt at the first likely spot.\'92\
\'91The wind\'92s in the West,\'92 said Sam. \'91If we get to the other side of this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.\'92 Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his geography.\
Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. Leaving the road they went into the deep resin- scented darkness of the trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great tree\'92s roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed.\
\'91Hobbits!\'92 he thought. \'91Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree. Three of them! There\'92s something mighty queer behind this.\'92 He was quite right, but he never found out any more about it.\
The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. \'91Walking for pleasure! Why didn\'92t I drive?\'92 he thought, as he usually did at the beginning of an\
\
three is company 95\
expedition. \'91And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.\'92 He stretched. \'91Wake up, hobbits!\'92 he cried. \'91It\'92s a beautiful morning.\'92\
\'91What\'92s beautiful about it?\'92 said Pippin, peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye. \'91Sam! Get breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got the bath-water hot?\'92\
Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. \'91No, sir, I haven\'92t, sir!\'92 he said.\
Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared.\
When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. \'91Water!\'92 shouted Pippin. \'91Where\'92s the water?\'92\
\'91I don\'92t keep water in my pockets,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91We thought you had gone to find some,\'92 said Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. \'91You had better go now.\'92\
\'91You can come too,\'92 said Frodo, \'91and bring all the water- bottles.\'92 There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.\
When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it was after ten o\'92clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed a heavy burden.\
The day\'92s march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles, however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary\
\
96 the fellowship of the ring\
zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down for the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze. They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine River. The road wound away before them like a piece of string.\
\'91The road goes on for ever,\'92 said Pippin; \'91but I can\'92t with- out a rest. It is high time for lunch.\'92 He sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round eyes were wide open \'96 for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon.\
\'91Do Elves live in those woods?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Not that I ever heard,\'92 said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:\
The Road goes ever on and on\
Down from the door where it began.\
Now far ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can,\
Pursuing it with weary feet, Until it joins some larger way,\
Where many paths and errands meet. And whither then? I cannot say.\
\'91That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo\'92s rhyming,\'92 said Pippin. \'91Or is it one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary. \'91\'91It\'92s a dangerous business,\
\
three is company 97\
Frodo, going out of your door,\'92\'92 he used to say. \'91\'91You step into the Road, and if you don\'92t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places?\'92\'92 He used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk.\'92\
\'91Well, the Road won\'92t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,\'92 said Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest.\
The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.\
\'91I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,\'92 said Sam.\
They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. \'91I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,\'92 said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.\
\'91It may not matter much,\'92 he said apologetically, \'91but I would rather not be seen on the road \'96 by anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,\'92 he added as an afterthought, \'91we can give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let\'92s get out of sight!\'92\
The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little\
\
98 the fellowship of the ring\
hollow not far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots.\
Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible.\
When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from side to side of the road.\
A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. \'91And I am still in the Shire,\'92 he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.\
Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right.\
\'91Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,\'92 said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour.\
\
three is company 99\
\'91I can\'92t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I\'92ve never seen or felt anything like it in the Shire before.\'92\
\'91But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?\'92 said Pippin. \'91And what is he doing in this part of the world?\'92 \'91There are some Men about,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have never heard of anything like this rider.\
I wonder where he comes from.\'92\
\'91Begging your pardon,\'92 put in Sam suddenly, \'91I know\
where he comes from. It\'92s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there\'92s more than one. And I know where he\'92s going to.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. \'91Why didn\'92t you speak up before?\'92\
\'91I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hallo, Sam! he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There\'92s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he\'92s only just gone. I\'92ve sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was he? says I to the Gaffer. I don\'92t know, says he; but he wasn\'92t a hobbit. He was tall and black-like, and he stooped over me. I reckon it was one of the Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny.\
\'91I couldn\'92t stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I didn\'92t give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn\'92t done no harm, sir, nor me.\'92\
\'91The Gaffer can\'92t be blamed anyway,\'92 said Frodo. \'91As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I nearly went and asked him who\
\
100 the fellowship of the ring\
it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about it before. I might have been more careful on the road.\'92\
\'91Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer\'92s stranger,\'92 said Pippin. \'91We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don\'92t see how he could have followed us.\'92\
\'91What about the smelling, sir?\'92 said Sam. \'91And the Gaffer said he was a black chap.\'92\
\'91I wish I had waited for Gandalf,\'92 Frodo muttered. \'91But perhaps it would only have made matters worse.\'92\
\'91Then you know or guess something about this rider?\'92 said Pippin, who had caught the muttered words.\
\'91I don\'92t know, and I would rather not guess,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.\'92\
\'91Yes, I think we will move on now,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but not on the road \'96 in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. We ought to do a good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.\'92\
The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they started off again. They now kept a stone\'92s throw to the left of the road, and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this hindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees began to draw together into thickets.\
The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some miles. At that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to Woodhall. \'91That is the way for us,\'92 said Frodo.\
Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches\
\
three is company 101\
that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. The hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood. They rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from time to time.\
Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure.\
Upon the hearth the fire is red, Beneath the roof there is a bed; But not yet weary are our feet, Still round the corner we may meet A sudden tree or standing stone That none have seen but we alone.\
Tree and flower and leaf and grass, Let them pass! Let them pass!\
Hill and water under sky,\
Pass them by! Pass them by!\
Still round the corner there may wait A new road or a secret gate,\
And though we pass them by today,\
\
102\
the fellowship of the ring\
Tomorrow we may come this way And take the hidden paths that run Towards the Moon or to the Sun.\
Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe, Let them go! Let them go!\
Sand and stone and pool and dell, Fare you well! Fare you well!\
Home is behind, the world ahead, And there are many paths to tread Through shadows to the edge of night, Until the stars are all alight.\
Then world behind and home ahead, We\'92ll wander back to home and bed.\
Mist and twilight, cloud and shade, Away shall fade! Away shall fade! Fire and lamp, and meat and bread, And then to bed! And then to bed!\
The song ended. \'91And now to bed! And now to bed!\'92 sang Pippin in a high voice.\
\'91Hush!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I think I hear hoofs again.\'92\
They stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree- shadows, listening. There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under the oak-trees.\
\'91Don\'92t let us go too far!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I don\'92t want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another Black Rider.\'92\
\'91Very well!\'92 said Pippin. \'91But don\'92t forget the sniffing!\'92\
The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.\
The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw\
\
three is company 103\
something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him.\
Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again.\
\'91Elves!\'92 exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. \'91Elves, sir!\'92 He would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not pulled him back.\
\'91Yes, it is Elves,\'92 said Frodo. \'91One can meet them some- times in the Woody End. They don\'92t live in the Shire, but they wander into it in spring and autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills. I am thankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he heard the voices he slipped away.\'92\
\'91What about the Elves?\'92 said Sam, too excited to trouble about the rider. \'91Can\'92t we go and see them?\'92\
\'91Listen! They are coming this way,\'92 said Frodo. \'91We have only to wait.\'92\
The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above the others. It was singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the others knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itself in their thought into words which they only partly under- stood. This was the song as Frodo heard it:\
\

the fellowship of the ring\
Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! O Queen beyond the Western Seas!\
O Light to us that wander here Amid the world of woven trees!\
Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!\
Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!\
Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee In a far land beyond the Sea.\
O stars that in the Sunless Year\
With shining hand by her were sown,\
In windy fields now bright and clear We see your silver blossom blown!\
O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!\
We still remember, we who dwell\
In this far land beneath the trees, Thy starlight on the Western Seas.\
The song ended. \'91These are High Elves! They spoke the name of Elbereth!\'92 said Frodo in amazement. \'91Few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of the Great Sea. This is indeed a strange chance!\'92\
The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came down the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. They bore no lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were now silent, and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.\
\'91Hail, Frodo!\'92 he cried. \'91You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps lost?\'92 Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and gathered round.\
\'91This is indeed wonderful!\'92 they said. \'91Three hobbits in a\
\
three is company 105\
wood at night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the meaning of it?\'92\
\'91The meaning of it, fair people,\'92 said Frodo, \'91is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are. I like walking under the stars. But I would welcome your company.\'92\
\'91But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,\'92 they laughed. \'91And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do not know whither we are going?\'92\
\'91And how do you know my name?\'92 asked Frodo in return.\
\'91We know many things,\'92 they said. \'91We have seen you often before with Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.\'92\
\'91Who are you, and who is your lord?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I am Gildor,\'92 answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. \'91Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.\'92\
\'91O Wise People!\'92 interrupted Pippin eagerly. \'91Tell us about the Black Riders!\'92\
\'91Black Riders?\'92 they said in low voices. \'91Why do you ask about Black Riders?\'92\
\'91Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so twice,\'92 said Pippin; \'91only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near.\'92\
The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. \'91We will not speak of this here,\'92 he said. \'91We think you had best come now with us. It is not our custom, but for this time we will take you on our road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.\'92\
\'91O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,\'92 said Pippin. Sam was speechless. \'91I thank you 
\f1 indeed, Gildor Inglorion,\'92 said Frodo bowing. \'91Elen s\uc0\u32 \u769 \u305 la lu\u32 \u769 menn\'92 omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,\'92 he added in the High-elven speech.\

\f0 \
106 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Be careful, friends!\'92 cried Gildor laughing. \'91Speak no secrets! Here is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail, Elf-friend!\'92 he said, bowing to Frodo. \'91Come now with your friends and join our company! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You may be weary before we halt.\'92\
\'91Why? Where are you going?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Wood- hall. It is some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your journey tomorrow.\'92\
They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo\'92s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy.\
The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river-valley. Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of Woodhall.\
The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo\
\
three is company 107\
and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.\
Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light.\
\'91Come!\'92 the Elves called to the hobbits. \'91Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!\'92\
Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. \'91There is a fire in the hall, and food for hungry guests,\'92 said an Elf standing before him.\
At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on heaped plates and dishes.\
\'91This is poor fare,\'92 they said to the hobbits; \'91for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better.\'92\
\'91It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,\'92 said Frodo.\
Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starv- ing; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended\
\
108 the fellowship of the ring\
fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon.\
Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: \'91Well, sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.\'92\
Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: \'91Here is a jewel among hobbits!\'92\
After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo\'92s feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.\
They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo ques- tioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart:\
\'91Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?\'92\
Gildor smiled. \'91Yes,\'92 he answered. \'91Twice. He said farewell to us on this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.\'92 He would say no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.\
\'91You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,\'92 said Gildor. \'91But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and in the thought behind your ques-\
\
three is company 109\
tions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. Is not that so?\'92\
\'91It is,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.\'92 He looked down at Sam, who was snoring gently.\
\'91The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,\'92 said Gildor.\
\'91The Enemy?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?\'92\
\'91I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,\'92 answered Gildor; \'91but I perceive that he is \'96 strange indeed though that seems to me. And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon either side.\'92\
\'91You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. What are the Black Riders?\'92\
\'91Has Gandalf told you nothing?\'92\
\'91Nothing about such creatures.\'92\
\'91Then I think it is not for me to say more \'96 lest terror\
should keep you from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.\'92\
\'91I cannot imagine what information could be more terrify- ing than your hints and warnings,\'92 exclaimed Frodo. \'91I knew that danger lay ahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire. Can\'92t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in peace?\'92\
\'91But it is not your own Shire,\'92 said Gildor. \'91Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.\'92\
\'91I know \'96 and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.\'92\
\
110 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91I think you should still follow that plan,\'92 said Gildor. \'91I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Shire?\'92\
\'91I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait for him?\'92\
Gildor was silent for a moment. \'91I do not like this news,\'92 he said at last. \'91That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.\'92\
\'91And it is also said,\'92 answered Frodo: \'91Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.\'92\
\'91Is it indeed?\'92 laughed Gildor. \'91Elves seldom give un- guarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship\'92s sake give it. I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty and willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to say too much.\'92\
\'91I am deeply grateful,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice\
\
three is company 111\
I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.\'92\
\'91Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?\'92 answered Gildor. \'91Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!\'92\
\'91But where shall I find courage?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91That is what I chiefly need.\'92\
\'91Courage is found in unlikely places,\'92 said Gildor. \'91Be of good hope! Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages through the lands. The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, and those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world.\'92\
Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. \'91I will sleep now,\'92 he said; and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber.\
\
Chapter 4\
A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS\
In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He jumped up and went out.\
Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.\
\'91They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,\'92 said Pippin. \'91Come and have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.\'92\
Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. \'91What is the plan for today?\'92 asked Pippin.\
\'91To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,\'92 answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food.\
\'91Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?\'92 asked Pippin cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him.\
\'91Yes, probably,\'92 said Frodo, not liking the reminder. \'91But I hope to get across the river without their seeing us.\'92\
\'91Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?\'92 \'91Not much \'96 only hints and riddles,\'92 said Frodo evasively. \'91Did you ask about the sniffing?\'92\
\'91We didn\'92t discuss it,\'92 said Frodo with his mouth full. \'91You should have. I am sure it is very important.\'92\
\'91In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain\
it,\'92 said Frodo sharply. \'91And now leave me in peace for a bit!\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 113\
I don\'92t want to answer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!\'92\
\'91Good heavens!\'92 said Pippin. \'91At breakfast?\'92 He walked away towards the edge of the green.\
From Frodo\'92s mind the bright morning \'96 treacherously bright, he thought \'96 had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing.\
\'91No! I could not!\'92 he said to himself. \'91It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another \'96 even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don\'92t think I ought even to take Sam.\'92 He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him.\
\'91Well, Sam!\'92 he said. \'91What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can \'96 in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.\'92\
\'91Very good, sir!\'92\
\'91You still mean to come with me?\'92\
\'91I do.\'92\
\'91It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. It is already danger-\
ous. Most likely neither of us will come back.\'92\
\'91If you don\'92t come back, sir, then I shan\'92t, that\'92s certain,\'92 said Sam. \'91Don\'92t you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon; and if any of those Black Riders try to stop him, they\'92ll\
have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They laughed.\'92 \'91Who are they, and what are you talking about?\'92\
\'91The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they\
seemed to know you were going away, so I didn\'92t see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!\'92\
\'91They are,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?\'92\
\'91They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,\'92 answered Sam slowly. \'91It don\'92t seem to matter what I think\
\
114 the fellowship of the ring\
about them. They are quite different from what I expected \'96 so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.\'92\
Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful.\
\'91Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now \'96 now that your wish to see them has come true already?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Yes, sir. I don\'92t know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can\'92t turn back. It isn\'92t to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want \'96 I don\'92t rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.\'92\
Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and called to Pippin.\
\'91All ready to start?\'92 he said as Pippin ran up. \'91We must be getting off at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.\'92\
\'91You slept late, you mean,\'92 said Pippin. \'91I was up long before; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.\'92\
\'91I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.\'92\
\'91Then you are going to fly,\'92 said Pippin. \'91You won\'92t cut straight on foot anywhere in this country.\'92\
\'91We can cut straighter than the road anyway,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left \'96 you can see a bend of it away north\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 115\
over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.\'92\
\'91Short cuts make long delays,\'92 argued Pippin. \'91The country is rough round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish \'96 I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can\'92t see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field.\'92\
\'91It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.\'92\
\'91All right!\'92 said Pippin. \'91I will follow you into every bog and ditch. But it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before sundown. The best beer in the East- farthing, or used to be: it is a long time since I tasted it.\'92\
\'91That settles it!\'92 said Frodo. \'91Short cuts make delays, but inns make longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?\'92\
\'91I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,\'92 said Sam (in spite of private misgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).\
\'91Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let\'92s go now!\'92 said Pippin.\
It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches and fences.\
\
116 the fellowship of the ring\
Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared. There were no paths in the under- growth, and they did not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most incon- veniently it cut across the line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to\
do. \'91First check!\'92 said Pippin, smiling grimly.\
Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the\
trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down.\
\'91Look!\'92 he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside it stooped a black figure.\
They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. \'91Whew!\'92 he said to Pippin. \'91We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we got under cover only just in time. You\'92ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?\'92\
They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but there was no sound of pursuit. \'91I don\'92t fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank,\'92 said Sam. \'91But I guess he knows we came down it. We had better be going on.\'92\
Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish and the River.\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 117\
\'91Why, this is the Stock-brook!\'92 said Pippin. \'91If we are going to try and get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.\'92\
They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the trees were too close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.\
After half an hour Pippin said: \'91I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt \'96 I should have said no more than a mile at the widest \'96 and we ought to have been through it by now.\'92\
\'91It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,\'92 said Frodo. \'91That won\'92t mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to come out into the open yet.\'92\
They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its feet was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was wonderfully refresh- ing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.\
\

Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:\
Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go\
To heal my heart and drown my woe. Rain may fall and wind may blow, And many miles be still to go,\
But under a tall tree I will lie,\
And let the clouds go sailing by.\
Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves.\
\'91And what do you think that was?\'92 Pippin asked at last, trying to speak lightly, but quavering a little. \'91If it was a bird, it was one that I never heard in the Shire before.\'92\
\'91It was not bird or beast,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It was a call, or a signal \'96 there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit has such a voice.\'92\
No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had shoul- dered their packs again and were off.\
Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass- lands stretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from the\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 119\
edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they could.\
At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind.\
They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.\
\'91I know these fields and this gate!\'92 he said. \'91This is Bam- furlong, old Farmer Maggot\'92s land. That\'92s his farm away there in the trees.\'92\
\'91One trouble after another!\'92 said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon\'92s den. The others looked at him in surprise.\
\'91What\'92s wrong with old Maggot?\'92 asked Pippin. \'91He\'92s a good friend to all the Brandybucks. Of course he\'92s a terror to trespassers, and keeps ferocious dogs \'96 but after all, folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard.\'92\
\'91I know,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But all the same,\'92 he added with a shamefaced laugh, \'91I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and then\
\
120 the fellowship of the ring\
took me and showed me to his dogs. \'91\'91See, lads,\'92\'92 he said, \'91\'91next time this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!\'92\'92 They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright \'96 though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have touched me.\'92\
Pippin laughed. \'91Well, it\'92s time you made it up. Especially if you are coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow \'96 if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let\'92s get into the lane and then we shan\'92t be trespassing. If we meet him, I\'92ll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry\'92s, and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.\'92\
They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane.\
Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, and a loud voice was heard shouting: \'91Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!\'92\
Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling.\
Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. \'91Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be wanting?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!\'92 said Pippin.\
The farmer looked at him closely. \'91Well, if it isn\'92t Master Pippin \'96 Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!\'92 he cried, changing\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 121\
from a scowl to a grin. \'91It\'92s a long time since I saw you round here. It\'92s lucky for you that I know you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too near the River,\'92 he said, shaking his head. \'91But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won\'92t cross my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.\'92\
\'91What fellow do you mean?\'92 asked Pippin.\
\'91Then you haven\'92t seen him?\'92 said the farmer. \'91He went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and asking funny questions. But per- haps you\'92ll come along inside, and we\'92ll pass the news more comfortable. I\'92ve a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your friends are willing, Mr. Took.\'92\
It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. \'91What about the dogs?\'92 asked Frodo anxiously.\
The farmer laughed. \'91They won\'92t harm you \'96 not unless I tell \'92em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!\'92 he cried. \'91Heel, Wolf!\'92 To the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.\
Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. \'91Mr. Frodo Baggins,\'92 he said. \'91You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.\'92 At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the arm.\
\'91Well, if that isn\'92t queerer than ever!\'92 he exclaimed. \'91Mr. Baggins is it? Come inside! We must have a talk.\'92\
They went into the farmer\'92s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust\
\
122 the fellowship of the ring\
of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however long ago.\
After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn.\
\'91Now, Mr. Peregrin,\'92 he said, \'91where might you be coming from, and where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit me? For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.\'92\
\'91Well, no,\'92 answered Pippin. \'91To tell you the truth, since you have guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.\'92\
\'91If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,\'92 said the farmer. \'91But I wasn\'92t worrying about that. You have leave to walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins \'96 though I daresay you still like mushrooms.\'92 He laughed. \'91Ah yes, I recognized the name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of Buckland. But it wasn\'92t mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that funny customer asked me?\'92\
They waited anxiously for him to go on. \'91Well,\'92 the farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, \'91he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want to be known. \'91\'91Now what in the Shire can he want?\'92\'92 I thought to myself. We don\'92t see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow.\
\'91 \'91\'91Good-day to you!\'92\'92 I says, going out to him. \'91\'91This lane don\'92t lead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to the road.\'92\'92 I didn\'92t like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took one sniff and let\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 123\
out a yelp as if he had been stung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.\
\'91\'91\'91I come from yonder,\'92\'92 he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over my fields, if you please. \'91\'91Have you seen Baggins?\'92\'92 he asked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.\
\'91 \'91\'91Be off !\'92\'92 I said. \'91\'91There are no Bagginses here. You\'92re in the wrong part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton \'96 but you can go by road this time.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91Baggins has left,\'92\'92 he answered in a whisper. \'91\'91He is coming. He is not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come back with gold.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91No you won\'92t,\'92\'92 I said. \'91\'91You\'92ll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.\'92\'92\
\'91He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do you think of that?\'92\
Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the Ferry. \'91I don\'92t know what to think,\'92 he said at last.\
\'91Then I\'92ll tell you what to think,\'92 said Maggot. \'91You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there.\'92 Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye. \'91But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left the Brandy- bucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo\'92s. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?\'92\
\
124 the fellowship of the ring\
Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting.\
\'91Well, Mr. Frodo,\'92 Maggot went on, \'91I\'92m glad that you\'92ve had the sense to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don\'92t get mixed up with these outlandish folk. You\'92ll have friends in these parts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I\'92ll deal with them. I\'92ll say you\'92re dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.\'92\
\'91Maybe you\'92re right,\'92 said Frodo, avoiding the farmer\'92s eye and staring at the fire.\
Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. \'91Well, I see you have ideas of your own,\'92 he said. \'91It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same after- noon; and maybe my news was no great news to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it won\'92t be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?\'92\
\'91I was thinking so,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But we have got to try and get there; and it won\'92t be done by sitting and thinking. So I am afraid we must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I\'92ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh to hear it. It\'92s a pity: for I\'92ve missed a good friend. And now I\'92m sorry to leave so soon. But I\'92ll come back, perhaps, one day \'96 if I get a chance.\'92\
\'91You\'92ll be welcome when you come,\'92 said Maggot. \'91But now I\'92ve a notion. It\'92s near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!\'92\
\'91And so should we!\'92 said Frodo. \'91But we must be going at once, I\'92m afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.\'92\
\'91Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 125\
supper, I\'92ll get out a small waggon, and I\'92ll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.\'92\
Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot\'92s sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled in and out. One or two other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones.\
When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. They threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door.\
\'91You be careful of yourself, Maggot!\'92 she called. \'91Don\'92t go arguing with any foreigners, and come straight back!\'92\
\'91I will!\'92 said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the high- banked causeway.\
Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging above the dikes, and crawling over the fields.\
\'91It\'92s going to be thick,\'92 said Maggot; \'91but I\'92ll not light my lanterns till I turn for home. We\'92ll hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight.\'92\
***\
\
126 the fellowship of the ring\
It was five miles or more from Maggot\'92s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies\'92 hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog.\
They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just beginning to scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them.\
Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies\'92 heads, and peering forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air.\
\'91You\'92d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,\'92 said Sam anxiously. \'91You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we\'92ll send this rider to the rightabouts!\'92 He climbed out and went to the farmer\'92s side. Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon.\
Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them.\
\'91Hallo there!\'92 called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard or two ahead.\
\'91Now then!\'92 said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward. \'91Don\'92t you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where are you going?\'92\
\'91I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?\'92 said a muffled voice \'96 but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer.\
\'91Mr. Merry!\'92 he cried.\
\'91Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?\'92 said Merry coming forward. As he came out of the mist and their fears\
\
a short cut to mushrooms 127\
subsided, he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit- size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog.\
Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. \'91So there you are at last!\'92 said Merry. \'91I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I\'92m blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck-pond?\'92\
\'91No, I caught \'92em trespassing,\'92 said the farmer, \'91and nearly set my dogs on \'92em; but they\'92ll tell you all the story, I\'92ve no doubt. Now, if you\'92ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I\'92d best be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.\'92\
He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. \'91Well, good night to you all,\'92 he said. \'91It\'92s been a queer day, and no mistake. But all\'92s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors. I\'92ll not deny that I\'92ll be glad now when I do.\'92 He lit his lanterns, and got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. \'91I was nearly forgetting,\'92 he said. \'91Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.\'92 He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of thanks and good-nights.\
They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.\
\
Chapter 5\
A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED\
\'91Now we had better get home ourselves,\'92 said Merry. \'91There\'92s something funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.\'92\
They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry- boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the water\'92s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.\
Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.\
Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew and grew, and after his days con-\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 129\
tinued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.\
The people in the Marish were friendly with the Buck- landers, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowl- edged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim.\
Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick and tall, for it was constantly tended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the Shire.\
The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buck- land shore drew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End.\
The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it\
\
130 the fellowship of the ring\
up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:\
\'91Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?\'92\
On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.\
\'91What in the Shire is that?\'92 exclaimed Merry.\
\'91Something that is following us,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But don\'92t ask any more now! Let\'92s get away at once!\'92 They hurried up the path to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen.\
\'91Thank goodness you don\'92t keep any boats on the west- bank!\'92 said Frodo. \'91Can horses cross the river?\'92\
\'91They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge \'96 or they might swim,\'92 answered Merry. \'91Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?\'92\
\'91I\'92ll tell you later. Let\'92s get indoors and then we can talk.\'92\
\'91All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I\'92ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We\'92ll see about supper and things.\'92\
\'91We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but we could do with another.\'92\
\'91You shall have it! Give me that basket!\'92 said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness.\
It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo\'92s new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country.\
At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 131\
could be seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old- fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.\
As they walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut them- selves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house.\
\'91Well, what do you think of it?\'92 asked Merry coming up the passage. \'91We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.\'92\
Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite things \'96 or Bilbo\'92s things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new setting) \'96 were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retire- ment. It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very night, before they all went to bed.\
\'91It\'92s delightful!\'92 he said with an effort. \'91I hardly feel that I have moved at all.\'92\

The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.\
\'91A bath!\'92 cried Pippin. \'91O blessed Meriadoc!\'92\
\'91Which order shall we go in?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Eldest first, or quickest first? You\'92ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.\'92\
\'91Trust me to arrange things better than that!\'92 said Merry. \'91We can\'92t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!\'92\
Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallow- ing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo\'92s favourite bath-songs.\
Sing hey! for the bath at close of day that washes the weary mud away!\
A loon is he that will not sing:\
O! Water Hot is a noble thing!\
O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,\
and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; but better than rain or rippling streams\
is Water Hot that smokes and steams.\
O! Water cold we may pour at need down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; but better is Beer, if drink we lack,\
and Water Hot poured down the back.\
O! Water is fair that leaps on high\
in a fountain white beneath the sky; but never did fountain sound so sweet as splashing Hot Water with my feet!\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 133\
There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. It appeared that a lot of Pippin\'92s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.\
Merry went to the door: \'91What about supper and beer in the throat?\'92 he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.\
\'91There\'92s so much water in the air that I\'92m coming into the kitchen to finish,\'92 he said.\
\'91Lawks!\'92 said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swim- ming. \'91You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat, Peregrin,\'92 he said. \'91Hurry up, or we shan\'92t wait for you.\'92\
They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. \'91I suppose you three won\'92t want mushrooms again?\'92 said Fredegar without much hope.\
\'91Yes we shall!\'92 cried Pippin.\
\'91They\'92re mine!\'92 said Frodo. \'91Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers\'92 wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I\'92ll serve them.\'92\
Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo\'92s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also many other things to fol- low, and when they had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drew chairs round the fire.\
\'91We\'92ll clear up later,\'92 said Merry. \'91Now tell me all about it! I guess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible.\'92\
\'91We have all been scared,\'92 said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. \'91You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.\'92\
\
134 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91And what are they?\'92\
\'91Black figures riding on black horses,\'92 answered Pippin. \'91If Frodo won\'92t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.\'92 He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various support- ing nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.\
\'91I should think you were making it all up,\'92 said Merry, \'91if I had not seen that black shape on the landing-stage \'96 and heard the queer sound in Maggot\'92s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?\'92\
\'91Cousin Frodo has been very close,\'92 said Pippin. \'91But the time has come for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot\'92s guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo\'92s treasure.\'92\
\'91That was only a guess,\'92 said Frodo hastily. \'91Maggot does not know anything.\'92\
\'91Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,\'92 said Merry. \'91A lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk. I\'92ve heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.\'92\
\'91I think,\'92 answered Frodo slowly, \'91that it was a good guess, as far as it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo\'92s old adven- tures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe here or anywhere else.\'92 He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves.\
\'91It\'92s coming out in a minute,\'92 whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.\
\'91Well!\'92 said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision. \'91I can\'92t keep it dark any longer. I have got something to tell you all. But I don\'92t know quite how to begin.\'92\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 135\
\'91I think I could help you,\'92 said Merry quietly, \'91by telling you some of it myself.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 said Frodo, looking at him anxiously.\
\'91Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don\'92t know how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once. And you don\'92t want to. We are very sorry for you.\'92\
Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed. \'91Dear old Frodo!\'92 said Pippin. \'91Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: \'91\'91Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder\'92\'92, and things like that. And pretending that you had come to the end of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville- Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.\'92\
\'91Good heavens!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I thought I had been both careful and clever. I don\'92t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my departure then?\'92\
\'91Oh no!\'92 said Merry. \'91Don\'92t worry about that! The secret won\'92t keep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you the truth, I have been watching you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!\'92\
\'91But I must go,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying\
\
136 the fellowship of the ring\
to keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!\'92\
\'91You do not understand!\'92 said Pippin. \'91You must go \'96 and therefore we must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon\'92s throat to save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure.\'92\
\'91My dear and most beloved hobbits!\'92 said Frodo deeply moved. \'91But I could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\'92\
\'91Of course we understand,\'92 said Merry firmly. \'91That is why we have decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.\'92\
\'91The Ring!\'92 said Frodo, now completely amazed.\
\'91Yes, the Ring,\'92 said Merry. \'91My dear old hobbit, you don\'92t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring for years \'96 before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful \'96 but he was not care- ful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.\'92\
\'91Go on!\'92 said Frodo faintly.\
\'91It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was looking straight at Bilbo\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 137\
when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.\
\'91After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow\'92s secret book.\'92\
\'91You have read his book!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?\'92\
\'91Not too safe, I should say,\'92 said Merry. \'91But I have only had one rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, Frodo?\'92\
\'91No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.\'92\
\'91Well, as I was saying,\'92 Merry proceeded, \'91I kept my know- ledge to myself, till this spring when things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.\'92\
\'91Where is he?\'92 said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.\
\'91Step forward, Sam!\'92 said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears. \'91Here\'92s our collector of infor- mation! And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.\'92\
\'91Sam!\'92 cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish.\
\'91Yes, sir!\'92 said Sam. \'91Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! take someone as you can trust.\'92\
\'91But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,\'92 said Frodo. Sam looked at him unhappily. \'91It all depends on what you\
\
138 the fellowship of the ring\
want,\'92 put in Merry. \'91You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin \'96 to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours \'96 closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid \'96 but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.\'92\
\'91And after all, sir,\'92 added Sam, \'91you did ought to take the Elves\'92 advice. Gildor said you should take them as was will- ing, and you can\'92t deny it.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t deny it,\'92 said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. \'91I don\'92t deny it, but I\'92ll never believe you are sleep- ing again, whether you snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.\
\'91You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!\'92 he said, turning to the others. \'91But bless you!\'92 he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, \'91I give in. I will take Gildor\'92s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.\'92\
\'91Good! That\'92s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!\'92 they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.\
It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:\
Farewell we call to hearth and hall! Though wind may blow and rain may fall, We must away ere break of day\
Far over wood and mountain tall.\
To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell\
In glades beneath the misty fell,\
Through moor and waste we ride in haste, And whither then we cannot tell.\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 139\
With foes ahead, behind us dread, Beneath the sky shall be our bed, Until at last our toil be passed, Our journey done, our errand sped.\
We must away! We must away! We ride before the break of day!\
\'91Very good!\'92 said Frodo. \'91But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed \'96 under a roof, for tonight at any rate.\'92\
\'91Oh! That was poetry!\'92 said Pippin. \'91Do you really mean to start before the break of day?\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91I fear those Black Riders, and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two things. How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.\'92\
\'91The answer to the second question,\'92 said Merry, \'91is that we could get off in an hour. I have prepared practically every- thing. There are five ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.\'92\
\'91It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?\'92\
\'91That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,\'92 answered Merry. \'91They could have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the river- bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they would try to keep them out, I think,\
\
140 the fellowship of the ring\
at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall \'96 for they would not like the look of the Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow.\'92\
Frodo sat for a while in thought. \'91I have made up my mind,\'92 he said finally. \'91I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don\'92t know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction.\'92\
\'91But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!\'92 said Fredegar horrified. \'91You can\'92t be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders.\'92\
\'91Not quite,\'92 said Merry. \'91It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. With luck we might get a considerable start.\'92\
\'91But you won\'92t have any luck in the Old Forest,\'92 objected Fredegar. \'91No one ever has luck in there. You\'92ll get lost. People don\'92t go in there.\'92\
\'91Oh yes they do!\'92 said Merry. \'91The Brandybucks go in \'96 occasionally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.\'92\
\'91Well, do as you think best!\'92 said Fredegar. \'91I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the\
\
a conspiracy unmasked 141\
stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.\'92\
Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo\'92s to help him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.\
\'91Excellent!\'92 said Frodo, when he understood the plan. \'91We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf other- wise. I don\'92t know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.\'92\
\'91Well, that\'92s that,\'92 said Pippin. \'91On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty\'92s \'96 waiting here till Black Riders come.\'92\
\'91You wait till you are well inside the Forest,\'92 said Fredegar. \'91You\'92ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.\'92\
\'91It\'92s no good arguing about it any more,\'92 said Merry. \'91We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.\'92\
When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark\
\
142 the fellowship of the ring\
sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later.\
Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder.\
\
Chapter 6\
THE OLD FOREST\
Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other. \'91All right! What is it?\'92 said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.\
\'91What is it!\'92 cried Merry. \'91It is time to get up. It is half past four and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and see us off.\'92\
Soon after six o\'92clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant house.\
In their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day\'92s work. They mounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs.\
\'91How are you going to get through this?\'92 asked Fredegar.\
\'91Follow me!\'92 said Merry, \'91and you will see.\'92 He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A cutting\
\
144 the fellowship of the ring\
had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.\
Here Fatty Bolger halted. \'91Good-bye, Frodo!\'92 he said. \'91I wish you were not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out. But good luck to you \'96 today and every day!\'92\
\'91If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.\'92 \'91Good-bye!\'92 they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar\'92s sight into the tunnel.\
It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.\
\'91There!\'92 said Merry. \'91You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old Forest.\'92\
\'91Are the stories about it true?\'92 asked Pippin.\
\'91I don\'92t know what stories you mean,\'92 Merry answered. \'91If you mean the old bogey-stories Fatty\'92s nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don\'92t believe them. But the Forest is queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And the trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don\'92t do much. Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the\
\
the old forest 145\
branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made.\'92\
\'91Is it only the trees that are dangerous?\'92 asked Pippin.\
\'91There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side,\'92 said Merry, \'91or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I am going to try and find.\'92\
The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.\
Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. \'91You had better lead on and find that path,\'92 Frodo said to him. \'91Don\'92t let us lose one another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!\'92\
They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground\
\
146 the fellowship of the ring\
was rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncom- fortable feeling that they were being watched with dis- approval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.\
There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout. \'91Oi! Oi!\'92 he cried. \'91I am not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!\'92\
The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before.\
\'91I should not shout, if I were you,\'92 said Merry. \'91It does more harm than good.\'92\
Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. \'91It has not taken you long to lose us,\'92 he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead.\
\'91Well, well!\'92 he said. \'91These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved away!\'92\
The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest-roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into\
\
the old forest 147\
the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hem- locks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close Forest.\
The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all.\
But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies\'92 hoofs, rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur.\
O! Wanderers in the shadowed land despair not! For though dark they stand, all woods there be must end at last,\
and see the open sun go past:\
the setting sun, the rising sun,\
the day\'92s end, or the day begun.\
For east or west all woods must fail . . .\
Fail \'96 even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging\
\
148 the fellowship of the ring\
tree with a crash into the path. The trees seemed to close in before them.\
\'91They do not like all that about ending and failing,\'92 said Merry. \'91I should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and then we\'92ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!\'92\
He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show it. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo\'92s heart, and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.\
They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.\
The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.\
\'91That,\'92 said Merry, pointing with his hand, \'91that is the line of the Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and\
\
the old forest 149\
flows south-west through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend. We don\'92t want to go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood \'96 the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.\'92\
The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view.\
The sun on the hill-top was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o\'92clock; but the autumn haze still pre- vented them from seeing much in other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon was veiled.\
On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood\'92s borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself.\
At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the north- ward side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the\
\
150 the fellowship of the ring\
direction they wished to take. After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed to be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood.\
At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were dis- covered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right and downwards.\
After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direc- tion, though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them \'96 eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it.\
The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so steep and overhung that it proved\
\
the old forest 151\
impossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or back- wards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind. All they could do was to follow the fold \'96 downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully over-arched by trees high above them.\
After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them. Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high steep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.\
\'91Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!\'92 said Merry. \'91We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.\'92\
He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to the water\'92s edge. \'91What\'92s more,\'92 he said, \'91there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually.\'92\
\'91I dare say!\'92 said Pippin. \'91That is, if the track goes on so\
\
152 the fellowship of the ring\
far, and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe all the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go?\'92\
\'91No,\'92 said Merry, \'91I haven\'92t. I don\'92t know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to make a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.\'92\
There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.\
The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches reached across the path. Each step forward became more reluctant than the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes.\
Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him Pippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. \'91It\'92s no good,\'92 he heard Merry saying. \'91Can\'92t go another step with- out rest. Must have nap. It\'92s cool under the willows. Less flies!\'92\
Frodo did not like the sound of this. \'91Come on!\'92 he cried. \'91We can\'92t have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.\'92 But the others were too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.\
Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His\
\
the old forest 153\
head swam. There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the grass.\
Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow.\
Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was over- powering him; then with an effort he struggled to his feet again. He felt a compelling desire for cool water. \'91Wait for me, Sam,\'92 he stammered. \'91Must bathe feet a minute.\'92\
Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feet in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.\
Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny. \'91There\'92s more behind this than sun and warm air,\'92 he muttered to himself. \'91I don\'92t like this great big tree. I don\'92t trust it. Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won\'92t do at all!\'92\
\
154 the fellowship of the ring\
He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast.\
He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge, and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once he woke, and coughed and spluttered.\
\'91Do you know, Sam,\'92 he said at length, \'91the beastly tree threw me in! I felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!\'92\
\'91You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,\'92 said Sam. \'91You shouldn\'92t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy.\'92\
\'91What about the others?\'92 Frodo asked. \'91I wonder what sort of dreams they are having.\'92\
They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers.\
Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor Merry. It was quite useless.\
\'91What a foul thing to happen!\'92 cried Frodo wildly. \'91Why did we ever come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!\'92 He kicked the tree with all his strength, heed- less of his own feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.\
\
the old forest 155\
\'91I suppose we haven\'92t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?\'92 asked Sam.\
\'91I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,\'92 said Frodo. \'91That wouldn\'92t be much use.\'92\
\'91Wait a minute!\'92 cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. \'91We might do something with fire!\'92\
\'91We might,\'92 said Frodo doubtfully. \'91We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside.\'92\
\'91We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,\'92 said Sam fiercely. \'91If it don\'92t let them go, I\'92ll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.\'92 He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes and a hatchet.\
Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.\
\'91Put it out! Put it out!\'92 cried Merry. \'91He\'92ll squeeze me in two, if you don\'92t. He says so!\'92\
\'91Who? What?\'92 shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the tree.\
\'91Put it out! Put it out!\'92 begged Merry. The branches of the willow began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river-valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help! help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice: it was\
\
156 the fellowship of the ring\
blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost and witless.\
Suddenly he stopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense:\
Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!\
Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song:\
Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!\
Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,\
There my pretty lady is, River-woman\'92s daughter, Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.\
Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing\
Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o, Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!\
Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! Tom\'92s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.\
Tom\'92s going home again water-lilies bringing.\
Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?\
Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and\
\
the old forest 157\
dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, stumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water-lilies.\
\'91Help!\'92 cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out.\
\'91Whoa! Whoa! steady there!\'92 cried the old man, holding up one hand, and they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. \'91Now, my little fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What\'92s the matter here then? Do you know who I am? I\'92m Tom Bombadil. Tell me what\'92s your trouble! Tom\'92s in a hurry now. Don\'92t you crush my lilies!\'92\
\'91My friends are caught in the willow-tree,\'92 cried Frodo breathlessly.\
\'91Master Merry\'92s being squeezed in a crack!\'92 cried Sam.\
\'91What?\'92 shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. \'91Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I\'92ll freeze his marrow cold, if he don\'92t behave himself. I\'92ll sing his roots off. I\'92ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away. Old Man Willow!\'92\
Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry\'92s feet still sticking out \'96 the rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the words, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it. \'91You let them out again, Old Man Willow!\'92 he said. \'91What be you\
\
158 the fellowship of the ring\
a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!\'92 He then seized Merry\'92s feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack.\
There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and complete silence fell.\
\'91Thank you!\'92 said the hobbits, one after the other.\
Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. \'91Well, my little fellows!\'92 said he, stooping so that he peered into their faces. \'91You shall come home with me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Goldberry is wait- ing. Time enough for questions around the supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!\'92 With that he picked up his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically.\
Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!\
Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! Tom\'92s going on ahead candles for to kindle.\
Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!\
Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. Hey now! merry dol! We\'92ll be waiting for you!\
After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam\
\
the old forest 159\
with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.\
It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood. They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening.\
Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed that the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over a short fall. Then sud- denly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which were already shining in the sky.\
The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom Bombadil\'92s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and\
\
160 the fellowship of the ring\
beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.\
They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol! rolled out the song to greet them.\
Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!\
Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:\
Now let the song begin! Let us sing together\
Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,\
Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,\
Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:\
Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!\
And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden light was all about them.\
\
Chapter 7\
IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL\
The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.\
In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget- me-nots. About her feet in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.\
\'91Enter, good guests!\'92 she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.\
\'91Come dear folk!\'92 she said, taking Frodo by the hand. \'91Laugh and be merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.\'92 Then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread out across it. \'91Let us shut out the night!\'92 she said. \'91For you are still afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.\'92\
\
162 the fellowship of the ring\
The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and smiled. \'91Fair lady Goldberry!\'92 said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. \'91Fair lady Goldberry!\'92 he said again. \'91Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me.\
O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water! O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!\
O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after! O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves\'92 laughter!\'92\
Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with sur- prise to hear himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.\
\'91Welcome!\'92 she said. \'91I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet-tongued. But I see that you are an Elf-friend; the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired beasts.\'92\
The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:\
Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;\
Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.\
\'91Fair lady!\'92 said Frodo again after a while. \'91Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?\'92\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 163\
\'91He is,\'92 said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.\
Frodo looked at her questioningly. \'91He is, as you have seen him,\'92 she said in answer to his look. \'91He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.\'92\
\'91Then all this strange land belongs to him?\'92\
\'91No indeed!\'92 she answered, and her smile faded. \'91That would indeed be a burden,\'92 she added in a low voice, as if to herself. \'91The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.\'92\
A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to Goldberry, took her hand.\
\'91Here\'92s my pretty lady!\'92 he said, bowing to the hobbits. \'91Here\'92s my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle! Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?\'92\
\'91It is,\'92 said Goldberry; \'91but the guests perhaps are not?\'92\
Tom clapped his hands and cried: \'91Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!\'92\
He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench laden with wide earthenware\
\
164 the fellowship of the ring\
basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed.\
Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the table, two on each side, while at either end sat Gold- berry and the Master. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.\
At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle; and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.\
\'91Have peace now,\'92 she said, \'91until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top. Good night!\'92 She passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.\
Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:\
\'91Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought you at that moment?\'92\
Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. \'91Eh, what?\'92 said he. \'91Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 165\
hear: I was busy singing. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you were wandering. We guessed you\'92d come ere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he\'92s a mighty singer; and it\'92s hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.\'92 Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:\
I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,\
green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,\
the last ere the year\'92s end to keep them from the winter, to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted. Each year at summer\'92s end I go to find them for her,\
in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle; there they open first in spring and there they linger latest. By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,\
fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.\
Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!\
He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:\
And that proved well for you \'96 for now I shall no longer go down deep again along the forest-water,\
not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing\
Old Man Willow\'92s house this side of spring-time,\
not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.\
He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more question: the one he most desired to have answered. \'91Tell us, Master,\'92 he said, \'91about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.\'92\
\'91No, don\'92t!\'92 said Merry and Pippin together, sitting sud- denly upright. \'91Not now! Not until the morning!\'92\
\
166 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91That is right!\'92 said the old man. \'91Now is the time for resting. Some things are ill to hear when the world\'92s in shadow. Sleep till the morning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey willow!\'92 And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room.\
Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep.\
In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howl- ing of many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. \'91Black Riders!\'92 thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some other unremembered dream.\
At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 167\
he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: \'91Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!\'92 Then he went to sleep again.\
It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. \'91I shall be drowned!\'92 he thought. \'91It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.\'92 He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his foot on the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: \'91Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and star- light and the wind off the hill-top.\'92 A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell asleep again.\
As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep content, if logs are contented.\
They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, and cried: \'91Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!\'92 He drew back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking west.\
They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to see turf right up to the walls,\
\
168 the fellowship of the ring\
turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimmer- ing deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.\
Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows: the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.\
\'91Good morning, merry friends!\'92 cried Tom, opening the eastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. \'91Sun won\'92t show her face much today, I\'92m thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hill-tops, since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass under- foot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but naught wakes hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come soon you\'92ll find breakfast on the table. If you come late you\'92ll get grass and rain-water!\'92\
Needless to say \'96 not that Tom\'92s threat sounded very serious \'96 the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning to look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. The room looked\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 169\
westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was com- pletely veiled.\
As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed now that they would not go further that day.\
The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain \'96 and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.\
\'91This is Goldberry\'92s washing day,\'92 he said, \'91and her autumn-cleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk \'96 let them rest while they are able! It\'92s a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the talking.\'92\
He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows. Often\
\
170 the fellowship of the ring\
his voice would turn to song, and he would get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles.\
As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom\'92s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.\
Suddenly Tom\'92s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the stone- rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 171\
fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind. Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.\
The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard. But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.\
When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, into times when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words, the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars.\
Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed\
\
172 the fellowship of the ring\
to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:\
\'91Who are you, Master?\'92 he asked.\
\'91Eh, what?\'92 said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. \'91Don\'92t you know my name yet? That\'92s the only answer. Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that\'92s what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed west- ward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless \'96 before the Dark Lord came from Outside.\'92\
A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight through a white shell.\
\'91The rain has ended,\'92 she said; \'91and new waters are running downhill, under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!\'92\
\'91And let us have food and drink!\'92 cried Tom. \'91Long tales are thirsty. And long listening\'92s hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!\'92 With that he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and dis- appeared.\
Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Gold- berry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 173\
were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests. \'91Supper is ready,\'92 said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes\'92 mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green stockings.\
It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of Tom\'92s words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after a time their hearts and spirits rose high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter.\
After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.\
He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they had imagined. \'91There\'92s earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,\'92 said Tom. It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.\
Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before\
\
174 the fellowship of the ring\
even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.\
\'91Show me the precious Ring!\'92 he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.\
It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!\
Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air \'96 and it vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry \'96 and Tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile.\
Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers and their queer ways \'96 then he slipped the Ring on.\
Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door.\
\'91Hey there!\'92 cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes. \'91Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil\'92s not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand\'92s more fair\
\
in the house of tom bombadil 175\
without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the right road, and keep your feet from wandering.\'92\
Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. \'91I am no weather-master,\'92 said he; \'91nor is aught that goes on two legs.\'92\
By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way to strike the East Road in a day\'92s journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told them not to be afraid \'96 but to mind their own business.\
\'91Keep to the green grass. Don\'92t you go a-meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!\'92 He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day.\
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!\
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!\
When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their bedroom.\
\
Chapter 8\
FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS\
That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.\
The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whist- ling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window. Outside every- thing was green and pale gold.\
After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh from the North- west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.\
They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-brow under which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.\
\'91Goldberry!\'92 he cried. \'91My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!\'92 He was so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 177\
light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.\
They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth-colours, until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.\
They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains.\
Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. \'91Speed now, fair guests!\'92 she said. \'91And hold to your purpose! North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun shines!\'92 And to Frodo she said: \'91Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry meeting!\'92\
But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly\
\
178 the fellowship of the ring\
down the gentle slope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil\'92s house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill.\
Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulders of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.\
About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked northwards. Then their hearts rose; for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected. Certainly the dis- tances had now all become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 179\
glimpsed a long dark line. \'91That is a line of trees,\'92 said Merry, \'91and that must mark the Road. All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted in the old days.\'92\
\'91Splendid!\'92 said Frodo. \'91If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place.\'92 But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.\
That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as good a noon- meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came from \'91down under Hill\'92. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.\
Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened. How- ever that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, beyond the\
\
180 the fellowship of the ring\
wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down.\
The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone.\
They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work.\
Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so chill that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were through the gap, they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog.\
Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separ- ated and wandering in different directions they went in file,\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 181\
with Frodo leading. Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.\
\'91Come on! Follow me!\'92 he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried forward. But his hope soon changed to bewil- derment and alarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others had not followed him.\
\'91Sam!\'92 he called. \'91Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don\'92t you keep up?\'92\
There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly: \'91Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!\'92 The pony bolted into the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: \'91Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!\'92 It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill.\
As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him. \'91Frodo! Hoy!\'92 came the thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clinging\
\
182 the fellowship of the ring\
night had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up.\
Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet chilled. It was wholly dark.\
\'91Where are you?\'92 he cried out miserably.\
There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss over the grass.\
He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.\
\'91Where are you?\'92 he cried again, both angry and afraid.\
\'91Here!\'92 said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the ground. \'91I am waiting for you!\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more.\
***\
\

When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast.\
But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.\
As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.\
***\
\

Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, some- times high in the air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation:\
Cold be hand and heart and bone,\
and cold be sleep under stone:\
never more to wake on stony bed,\
never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead. In the black wind the stars shall die,\
and still on gold here let them lie, till the dark lord lifts his hand over dead sea and withered land.\
He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.\
At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, griev- ing for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive him- self. Gandalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do.\
But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 185\
wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a snarling noise.\
Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry\'92s face felt cold. All at once back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom singing. He re- membered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet.\
Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!\
By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!\
There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice singing:\
Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,\
Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.\
None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master: His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.\
There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low door-like opening appeared at the end of\
\
186 the fellowship of the ring\
the chamber beyond Frodo\'92s feet; and there was Tom\'92s head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of the sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep.\
Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:\
Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!\
Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,\
Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!\
Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,\
Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.\
At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that silence.\
\'91Come, friend Frodo!\'92 said Tom. \'91Let us get out on to clean grass! You must help me bear them.\'92\
Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again, and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.\
There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice:\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 187\
Wake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling! Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen; Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken. Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!\
To Frodo\'92s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.\
\'91What in the name of wonder?\'92 began Merry, feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his face, and he closed his eyes. \'91Of course, I remember!\'92 he said. \'91The men of Carn Du\'88m came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my heart!\'92 He clutched at his breast. \'91No! No!\'92 he said, opening his eyes. \'91What am I saying? I have been dream- ing. Where did you get to, Frodo?\'92\
\'91I thought that I was lost,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but I don\'92t want to speak of it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!\'92\
\'91Dressed up like this, sir?\'92 said Sam. \'91Where are my clothes?\'92 He flung his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other hobbit-garments lying some- where to hand.\
\'91You won\'92t find your clothes again,\'92 said Tom, bounding down from the mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry glint in his eyes.\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half amused. \'91Why not?\'92\
But Tom shook his head, saying: \'91You\'92ve found your- selves again, out of the deep water. Clothes are but little loss,\
\
188 the fellowship of the ring\
if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heat now heart and limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!\'92\
He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:\
Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander? Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder? Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin, White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!\
So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.\
The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise.\
By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 189\
\'91Here are your ponies, now!\'92 he said. \'91They\'92ve more sense (in some ways) than you wandering hobbits have \'96 more sense in their noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow-wights is not what they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!\'92\
Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter.\
\'91Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91He\'92s mine,\'92 said Tom. \'91My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he\'92d look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom\'92s going to ride. Hey! he\'92s coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, when you\'92re on your own legs trying to trot beside them.\'92\
The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land. \'91I\'92ve got things to do,\'92 he said: \'91my making and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can\'92t be always near to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting.\'92\
It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom\'92s\
\
190 the fellowship of the ring\
provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he made into a pile that glistered and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie there \'91free to all finders, birds, beasts, Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures\'92; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at last:\
\'91Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not forget her!\'92\
For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf- shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.\
\'91Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,\'92 he said. \'91Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or far away into dark and danger.\'92 Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Du\'88 m in the Land of Angmar.\
\'91Few now remember them,\'92 Tom murmured, \'91yet still some go wandering, sons of forgotten kings walking in lone- liness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless.\'92\
The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 191\
shapes of Men, tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them.\
At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view.\
Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.\
They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long time ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not say much.\
They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had\
\
192 the fellowship of the ring\
been bearing somewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away below them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of water.\
They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing to be seen. \'91Well, here we are again at last!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I suppose we haven\'92t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful \'96 it may have put them off our trail.\'92\
The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty.\
\'91Do you think,\'92 asked Pippin hesitatingly, \'91do you think we may be pursued, tonight?\'92\
\'91No, I hope not tonight,\'92 answered Tom Bombadil; \'91nor perhaps the next day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond his country.\'92\
All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering\
\
fog on the barrow-downs 193\
twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting.\
\'91Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you\'92ll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. There you\'92ll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!\'92\
They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:\
Tom\'92s country ends here: he will not pass the borders. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!\
Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin\'92s back, and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.\
The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.\
\'91I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,\'92 said Sam. \'91He\'92s a caution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better, nor queerer. But I won\'92t deny I\'92ll be glad to see this Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it\'92ll be like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?\'92\
\'91There are hobbits in Bree,\'92 said Merry, \'91as well as Big Folk. I daresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts. My people ride out there now and again.\'92\
\'91It may be all we could wish,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but it is outside the Shire all the same. Don\'92t make yourselves too much at\
\
194 the fellowship of the ring\
home! Please remember \'96 all of you \'96 that the name of Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.\'92\
They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.\
Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the night.\

AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY\
Bree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles broad.\
The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of the world about them than was (or is) usual with Big People. According to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they were still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the grass.\
In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing of their origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten tales which were\
\

eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends of them.\
There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; and they claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was founded long before even the Brandy- wine was crossed and the Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men. The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.\
The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though their little land was not much further than a day\'92s riding east of the Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them, considering them dull and uncouth. There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between the Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.\
The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 197\
windows looking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village. The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.\
Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside the dike at the western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, and the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the Bree-folk called it the Greenway.\
The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.\
It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise.\
\'91What do you want, and where do you come from?\'92 he asked gruffly.\
\
198 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91We are making for the inn here,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91We are journeying east and cannot go further tonight.\'92\
\'91Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what\'92s more, out of the Shire by their talk,\'92 said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through.\
\'91We don\'92t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,\'92 he went on, as they halted a moment by his door. \'91You\'92ll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?\'92\
\'91Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to discuss them,\'92 said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the tone of his voice.\
\'91Your business is your own, no doubt,\'92 said the man; \'91but it\'92s my business to ask questions after nightfall.\'92\
\'91We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here,\'92 put in Merry. \'91I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had heard.\'92\
\'91All right, all right!\'92 said the man. \'91I meant no offence. But you\'92ll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you questions. There\'92s queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony, you\'92ll find you\'92re not the only guests.\'92\
He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf ? He might have arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy.\
The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street.\

The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.\
\'91We surely aren\'92t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?\'92 he exclaimed. \'91If there are hobbit-folk in these parts, why don\'92t we look for some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.\'92\
\'91What\'92s wrong with the inn?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it\'92s homelike enough inside.\'92\
Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor windows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a large sign- board: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door was painted in white letters: the prancing pony by barliman butterbur. Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.\
As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping.\
They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went\
\
200 the fellowship of the ring\
forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.\
\'91Can we\'97\'97\'92 began Frodo.\
\'91Half a minute, if you please!\'92 shouted the man over his shoulder, and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron.\
\'91Good evening, little master!\'92 he said, bending down. \'91What may you be wanting?\'92\
\'91Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr. Butterbur?\'92\
\'91That\'92s right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! You\'92re from the Shire, eh?\'92 he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. \'91Hobbits!\'92 he cried. \'91Now what does that remind me of ? Might I ask your names, sirs?\'92\
\'91Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,\'92 said Frodo; \'91and this is Sam Gamgee. My name is Underhill.\'92\
\'91There now!\'92 said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. \'91It\'92s gone again! But it\'92ll come back, when I have time to think. I\'92m run off my feet; but I\'92ll see what I can do for you. We don\'92t often get a party out of the Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn\'92t been for long enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree.\'92\
\'91Hi! Nob!\'92 he shouted. \'91Where are you, you woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!\'92\
\'91Coming, sir! Coming!\'92 A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great interest.\
\'91Where\'92s Bob?\'92 asked the landlord. \'91You don\'92t know? Well, find him! Double sharp! I haven\'92t got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there\'92s five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.\'92 Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 201\
\'91Well now, what was I going to say?\'92 said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead. \'91One thing drives out another, so to speak. I\'92m that busy tonight, my head is going round. There\'92s a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night \'96 and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there\'92s a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now there\'92s you. If you weren\'92t hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we\'92ve got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you\'92ll be comfortable. You\'92ll be wanting supper, I don\'92t doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!\'92\
He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. \'91Here is a nice little parlour!\'92 he said. \'91I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I\'92m that busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It\'92s hard work for two legs, but I don\'92t get thinner. I\'92ll look in again later. If you want anything, ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don\'92t come, ring and shout!\'92\
Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs. There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates.\
\'91Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?\'92 he asked. \'91And shall I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?\'92\
They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show,\
\
202 the fellowship of the ring\
and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam\'92s misgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer).\
The landlord hovered round for a little, and then prepared to leave them. \'91I don\'92t know whether you would care to join the company, when you have supped,\'92 he said, standing at the door. \'91Perhaps you would rather go to your beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a mind. We don\'92t get Outsiders \'96 travellers from the Shire, I should say, begging your pardon \'96 often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack anything!\'92\
So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour\'92s steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it would be too stuffy. \'91I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don\'92t forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the high-road and not very far from the Shire!\'92\
\'91All right!\'92 said Pippin. \'91Mind yourself ! Don\'92t get lost, and don\'92t forget that it is safer indoors!\'92\
The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange-looking men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners.\
As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the Greenway, stared at them\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 203\
curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical (and to the Shire- folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heather- toes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which were used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Staddle, and as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.\
The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern lands.\
At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with \'91Old Barliman here\'92, to whom he could go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon found himself sitting alone in a corner, listening and looking around.\
The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away in the South, and it seemed\
\
204 the fellowship of the ring\
that the Men who had come up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was fore- telling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future. \'91If room isn\'92t found for them, they\'92ll find it for themselves. They\'92ve a right to live, same as other folk,\'92 he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect.\
The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire. Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree- landers, who seemed to have been in the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they were related to.\
Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather- beaten man, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.\
\'91Who is that?\'92 Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whis- per to Mr. Butterbur. \'91I don\'92t think you introduced him?\'92\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 205\
\'91Him?\'92 said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye without turning his head. \'91I don\'92t rightly know. He is one of the wandering folk \'96 Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven\'92t seen him about lately. What his right name is I\'92ve never heard: but he\'92s known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he don\'92t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there\'92s no accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.\'92 But at that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained.\
Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near he threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.\
\'91I am called Strider,\'92 he said in a low voice. \'91I am very pleased to meet you, Master \'96 Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.\'92\
\'91He did,\'92 said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes.\
\'91Well, Master Underhill,\'92 said Strider, \'91if I were you, I should stop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and chance-meeting are pleasant enough, but, well \'96 this isn\'92t the Shire. There are queer folk about. Though I say it as shouldn\'92t, you may think,\'92 he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo\'92s glance. \'91And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,\'92 he went on, watching Frodo\'92s face.\
Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous\
\
206 the fellowship of the ring\
young Took, encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic account of Bilbo\'92s farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.\
Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and had prob- ably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo\'92s vanishing. It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree after that name.\
Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evi- dently much enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.\
\'91You had better do something quick!\'92 whispered Strider in his ear.\
Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention of Pippin\'92s audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and laughed and clapped, think- ing that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.\
Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring on its chain, and quite unac- countably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if the suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something in the room. He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke \'91a few suitable words\'92, as they would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 207\
friendship between the Shire and Bree; and then he hesitated and coughed.\
Everyone in the room was now looking at him. \'91A song!\'92 shouted one of the hobbits. \'91A song! A song!\'92 shouted all the others. \'91Come on now, master, sing us something that we haven\'92t heard before!\'92\
For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud of, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that is probably why it came into Frodo\'92s mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.\
There is an inn, a merry old inn beneath an old grey hill,\
And there they brew a beer so brown\
That the Man in the Moon himself came down\
one night to drink his fill.\
The ostler has a tipsy cat\
that plays a five-stringed fiddle;\
And up and down he runs his bow, Now squeaking high, now purring low,\
now sawing in the middle.\
The landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond of jokes;\
When there\'92s good cheer among the guests, He cocks an ear at all the jests\
and laughs until he chokes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 They also keep a horne\uc0\u32 \u769 d cow as proud as any queen;\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 But music turns her head like ale, And makes her wave her tufted tail\
and dance upon the green.\
\
208\
the fellowship of the ring\
And O! the rows of silver dishes and the store of silver spoons!\
For Sunday* there\'92s a special pair, And these they polish up with care\
on Saturday afternoons.\
The Man in the Moon was drinking deep, and the cat began to wail;\
A dish and a spoon on the table danced, The cow in the garden madly pranced,\
and the little dog chased his tail.\
The Man in the Moon took another mug, and then rolled beneath his chair;\
And there he dozed and dreamed of ale, Till in the sky the stars were pale,\
and dawn was in the air.\
Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat: \'91The white horses of the Moon,\
They neigh and champ their silver bits;\
But their master\'92s been and drowned his wits,\
and the Sun\'92ll be rising soon!\'92\
So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, a jig that would wake the dead:\
He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:\
\'91It\'92s after three!\'92 he said.\
They rolled the Man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the Moon,\
While his horses galloped up in rear, And the cow came capering like a deer,\
and a dish ran up with the spoon.\
* See note 2, III, p. 1462\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 209\
Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; the dog began to roar,\
The cow and the horses stood on their heads; The guests all bounded from their beds\
and danced upon the floor.\
With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke! the cow jumped over the Moon,\
And the little dog laughed to see such fun, And the Saturday dish went off at a run\
with the silver Sunday spoon.\
The round Moon rolled behind the hill as the Sun raised up her head.\
She* hardly believed her fiery eyes; For though it was day, to her surprise\
they all went back to bed!\
There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song tickled their fancy. \'91Where\'92s old Barley?\'92 they cried. \'91He ought to hear this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we\'92d have a dance.\'92 They called for more ale, and began to shout: \'91Let\'92s have it again, master! Come on now! Once more!\'92\
They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo\'92s turn to feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short in gaping silence; for the singer\
* Elves (and Hobbits) always refer to the Sun as She.\
\
210 the fellowship of the ring\
disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole!\
The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a corner, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But there was one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening.\
Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under the tables to the dark corner by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.\
\'91Well?\'92 said Strider, when he reappeared. \'91Why did you do that? Worse than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or should I say your finger?\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know what you mean,\'92 said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.\
\'91Oh yes, you do,\'92 answered Strider; \'91but we had better wait until the uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a quiet word with you.\'92\
\'91What about?\'92 asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.\
\'91A matter of some importance \'96 to us both,\'92 answered\
\
at the sign of the prancing pony 211\
Strider, looking Frodo in the eye. \'91You may hear something to your advantage.\'92\
\'91Very well,\'92 said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. \'91I\'92ll talk to you later.\'92\
Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time.\
\'91I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,\'92 said a hobbit; \'91or leastways I didn\'92t see him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of speaking.\'92\
\'91You don\'92t say, Mr. Mugwort!\'92 said the landlord, looking puzzled.\
\'91Yes I do!\'92 replied Mugwort. \'91And I mean what I say, what\'92s more.\'92\
\'91There\'92s some mistake somewhere,\'92 said Butterbur, shak- ing his head. \'91There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or into thick air, as is more likely in this room.\'92\
\'91Well, where is he now?\'92 cried several voices.\
\'91How should I know? He\'92s welcome to go where he will, so long as he pays in the morning. There\'92s Mr. Took, now: he\'92s not vanished.\'92\
\'91Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn\'92t,\'92 said Mugwort obstinately.\
\'91And I say there\'92s some mistake,\'92 repeated Butterbur, picking up the tray and gathering up the broken crockery.\
\'91Of course there\'92s a mistake!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I haven\'92t van- ished. Here I am! I\'92ve just been having a few words with Strider in the corner.\'92\
He came forward into the firelight; but most of the com- pany backed away, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that\

evening. One or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.\
Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, that his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed. \'91Now what have you been doing, Mr. Underhill?\'92 he asked. \'91Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics!\'92\
\'91I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It was quite unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.\'92\
\'91All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you\'92re going to do any more tumbling, or conjuring, or whatever it was, you\'92d best warn folk beforehand \'96 and warn me. We\'92re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way \'96 uncanny, if you understand me; and we don\'92t take to it all of a sudden.\'92\
\'91I shan\'92t be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And now I think I\'92ll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o\'92clock?\'92\
\'91Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you. I hope that you\'92ll not take it amiss. When I\'92ve seen to a thing or two, I\'92ll come along to your room, if you\'92re willing.\'92\
\'91Certainly!\'92 said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect even old Butterbur\'92s fat face of concealing dark designs.\
\
Chapter 10 STRIDER\
Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!\
\'91Hallo!\'92 said Pippin. \'91Who are you, and what do you want?\'92\
\'91I am called Strider,\'92 he answered; \'91and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.\'92\
\'91You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,\'92 said Frodo. \'91What have you to say?\'92\
\'91Several things,\'92 answered Strider. \'91But, of course, I have my price.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 asked Frodo sharply.\
\'91Don\'92t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some good advice \'96 but I shall want a reward.\'92\
\'91And what will that be, pray?\'92 said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.\
\'91No more than you can afford,\'92 answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo\'92s thoughts. \'91Just this: you must take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.\'92\
\'91Oh, indeed!\'92 replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. \'91Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.\'92\
\
214 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Excellent!\'92 exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably. \'91You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have heard me.\'92\
\'91Go on then!\'92 said Frodo. \'91What do you know?\'92\
\'91Too much; too many dark things,\'92 said Strider grimly. \'91But as for your business\'97\'97\'92 He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. \'91I have quick ears,\'92 he went on, lowering his voice, \'91and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another; but one thing interested me. Please remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t see what interest my name has for anyone in Bree,\'92 said Frodo angrily, \'91and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to explain it.\'92\
\'91Well answered!\'92 said Strider laughing. \'91But the explanation is simple: I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.\
\'91Now, don\'92t mistake me!\'92 he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam jumped up with a scowl. \'91I shall take more care of the secret than you do. And care is needed!\'92 He leaned forward and looked at them. \'91Watch every shadow!\'92 he said in a low voice. \'91Black horsemen have passed through Bree.\
\
strider 215\
On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the Greenway from the south.\'92\
There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: \'91I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,\'92 he said. \'91And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here.\'92\
\'91It would have been better,\'92 said Strider. \'91I would have stopped your going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see you, or take a message.\'92\
\'91Do you think he\'97\'97\'92 began Frodo.\
\'91No, I don\'92t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.\'92 Frodo gave him a puzzled look. \'91Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?\'92 said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. \'91But I hope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song. For that little prank\'97\'97\'92\
\'91It was sheer accident!\'92 interrupted Frodo.\
\'91I wonder,\'92 said Strider. \'91Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.\'92\
\'91Hardly more than it was already,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away.\'92\
\'91You must not count on that!\'92 said Strider sharply. \'91They will return. And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these Riders.\'92 He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. \'91And there are some folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,\'92 he went on. \'91Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they slipped out together just after\
\
216 the fellowship of the ring\
your \'91\'91accident\'92\'92. Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for amusement.\'92\
\'91What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?\'92 said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider\'92s hints.\
\'91News of you, of course,\'92 answered Strider. \'91An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won\'92t go far. They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!\'92\
The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.\
\'91There!\'92 he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. \'91Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?\'92\
There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer; his mind was confused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:\
\'91With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I\'92d say no! This Strider here,\
\
strider 217\
he warns and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let\'92s begin with him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something, that\'92s plain, and more than I like; but it\'92s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it.\'92\
Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. \'91No,\'92 he said slowly. \'91I don\'92t agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don\'92t see why you should warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about \'96 about my business; and how do you know it?\'92\
\'91The lesson in caution has been well learned,\'92 said Strider with a grim smile. \'91But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here it is\'97\'97\'92\
At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.\
\'91I\'92ve come to bid you good night,\'92 said the landlord, putting the candles on the table. \'91Nob! Take the water to the rooms!\'92 He came in and shut the door.\
\'91It\'92s like this,\'92 he began, hesitating and looking troubled. \'91If I\'92ve done any harm, I\'92m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you\'92ll admit; and I\'92m a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of Baggins in particular.\'92\
\
218 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91And what has that got to do with me?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91Ah! you know best,\'92 said the landlord, knowingly. \'91I won\'92t give you away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may say so.\'92\
\'91Indeed! Let\'92s have it then!\'92 said Frodo, unwisely inter- rupting.\
\'91A stout little fellow with red cheeks,\'92 said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. \'91That won\'92t help you much; it goes for most hobbits, Barley, he says to me,\'92 continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. \'91But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your pardon, but he said it, not me.\'92\
\'91He said it? And who was he?\'92 asked Frodo eagerly.\
\'91Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, but he\'92s a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don\'92t know what he\'92ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn\'92t wonder. He\'92s a bit hasty. Still what\'92s done can\'92t be undone.\'92\
\'91Well, what have you done?\'92 said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur\'92s thoughts.\
\'91Where was I?\'92 said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. \'91Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room without a knock. Barley, he says, I\'92m off in the morning. Will you do something for me? You\'92ve only to name it, I said. I\'92m in a hurry, said he, and I\'92ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a letter.\
\'91It\'92s addressed plain enough,\'92 said Mr. Butterbur, pro- ducing a letter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):\
\
strider 219 Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON\
in the SHIRE.\
\'91A letter for me from Gandalf !\'92 cried Frodo.\
\'91Ah!\'92 said Mr. Butterbur. \'91Then your right name is Baggins?\'92\
\'91It is,\'92 said Frodo, \'91and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent it. That\'92s what you came to tell me, I suppose, though you\'92ve taken a long time to come to the point.\'92\
Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. \'91You\'92re right, master,\'92 he said, \'91and I beg your pardon. And I\'92m mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it. But I didn\'92t keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. Then I couldn\'92t find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after another drove it out of my mind. I\'92m a busy man. I\'92ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there\'92s any help I can give, you\'92ve only to name it.\
\'91Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him and another. He\'92ll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! But you need ask no questions. And if I\'92m not with him, he may be in trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I\'92ll be grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91These black men,\'92 said the landlord lowering his voice. \'91They\'92re looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I\'92m a hobbit. It was on Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny, I called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob\'92s hair was all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they\'92ve been asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he\'92s been asking\
\
220 the fellowship of the ring\
questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, before you\'92d had bite or sup, he did.\'92\
\'91He did!\'92 said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. \'91And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.\'92\
The landlord jumped with surprise. \'91You!\'92 he cried. \'91You\'92re always popping up. What do you want now?\'92\
\'91He\'92s here with my leave,\'92 said Frodo. \'91He came to offer me his help.\'92\
\'91Well, you know your own business, maybe,\'92 said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider. \'91But if I was in your plight, I wouldn\'92t take up with a Ranger.\'92\
\'91Then who would you take up with?\'92 asked Strider. \'91A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off ?\'92\
\'91Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn\'92t do that for any money,\'92 said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. \'91But why can\'92t you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men after, and where do they come from, I\'92d like to know?\'92\
\'91I\'92m sorry I can\'92t explain it all,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91I am tired and very worried, and it\'92s a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from\'97\'97\'92\
\'91They come from Mordor,\'92 said Strider in a low voice. \'91From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you.\'92\
\'91Save us!\'92 cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evi- dently was known to him. \'91That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.\'92\
\'91It is,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Are you still willing to help me?\'92\
\'91I am,\'92 said Mr. Butterbur. \'91More than ever. Though I don\'92t know what the likes of me can do against, against\'97\'97\'92 he faltered.\
\'91Against the Shadow in the East,\'92 said Strider quietly. \'91Not\

221\
can let Mr. and you can\
\'91I\'92ll do that,\'92 said Butterbur. \'91But they\'92ll find\
without help from me, I\'92m afraid. It\'92s a pity\
drew attention to himself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo\'92s going off has been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate; and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he is.\'92\
\'91Well, we can only hope the Riders won\'92t come back yet,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91I hope not, indeed,\'92 said Butterbur. \'91But spooks or no spooks, they won\'92t get in The Pony so easy. Don\'92t you worry till the morning. Nob\'92ll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me and my folk\'92ll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you can.\'92\
\'91In any case we must be called at dawn,\'92 said Frodo. \'91We must get off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.\'92 \'91Right! I\'92ll see to the orders,\'92 said the landlord. \'91Good night, Mr. Baggins \'96 Underhill, I should say! Good night \'96 now,\
bless me! Where\'92s your Mr. Brandybuck?\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had\
forgotten all about Merry, and it was getting late. \'91I am afraid he is out. He said something about going for a breath of air.\'92 \'91Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a holiday!\'92 said Butterbur. \'91I must go and bar the doors quick, but I\'92ll see your friend is let in when he comes. I\'92d better send Nob to look for him. Good night to you all!\'92 At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another doubt- ful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps\
retreated down the passage.\
\'91Well?\'92 said Strider. \'91When are you going to open that letter?\'92 Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be Gandalf\'92s. Inside, written in the wizard\'92s strong but graceful script, was the following message:\
much, Barliman, but every little helps. You Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill; forget the name of Baggins, till he is far away.\'92\

THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear\'92s Day, Shire Year,\
1418.\
Dear Frodo,\
Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.\
Yours in haste GANDALF.\
PS. Do NOT use It again, not for any reason whatever! Do not travel by night!\
PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.\
All that is gold does not glitter,\
Not all those who wander are lost;\
The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,\
A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken,\
The crownless again shall be king.\
PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-\
room: thing wanted always buried.\
If he forgets, I shall roast him.\
Fare Well!\
    \
strider 223\
Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. \'91Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!\'92 he said. \'91He deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf ? He writes as if he was going into great danger.\'92\
\'91He has been doing that for many years,\'92 said Strider.\
Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf\'92s second postscript. \'91Why didn\'92t you tell me that you were Gandalf \'92s friend at once?\'92 he asked. \'91It would have saved time.\'92\
\'91Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?\'92 said Strider. \'91I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend to tell you all about myself at once. I had to study you first, and make sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,\'92 he added with a queer laugh, \'91that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.\'92\
\'91They are \'96 at first sight at any rate,\'92 laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf\'92s letter. \'91But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches.\'92\
\'91It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider,\'92 he answered. \'91And you would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.\'92\
Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider dubiously. \'91How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?\'92 he demanded. \'91You never men- tioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with\
\
224 the fellowship of the ring\
you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have you to say to that?\'92\
\'91That you are a stout fellow,\'92 answered Strider; \'91but I am afraid my only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. If I was after the Ring, I could have it \'96 now!\'92\
He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.\
\'91But I am the real Strider, fortunately,\'92 he said, looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile. \'91I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.\'92\
There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesita- tion. \'91I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,\'92 he said, \'91or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his spies would \'96 well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.\'92\
\'91I see,\'92 laughed Strider. \'91I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.\'92 \'91Did the verses apply to you then?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91I could not make out what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf \'92s letter, if you have never seen it?\'92 \'91I did not know,\'92 he answered. \'91But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name.\'92 He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. \'91Not much use is it, Sam?\'92 said Strider. \'91But the time is\
near when it shall be forged anew.\'92\
Sam said nothing.\
\'91Well,\'92 said Strider, \'91with Sam\'92s permission we will call that\
settled. Strider shall be your guide. And now I think it is time you went to bed and took what rest you can. We shall have\
\
strider 225\
a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.\'92\
\'91Weathertop?\'92 said Sam. \'91What\'92s that?\'92\
\'91It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers.\'92\
\'91When did you last see Gandalf?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?\'92\
Strider looked grave. \'91I do not know,\'92 he said. \'91I came west with him in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the first of May: at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.\
\'91I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously.\'92\
\'91Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it \'96 with Gandalf \'92s absence, I mean?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself,\'92 said Strider. \'91But do not\
\
226 the fellowship of the ring\
give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know \'96 as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.\'92\
Pippin yawned. \'91I am sorry,\'92 he said, \'91but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in the dark to look for him.\'92\
At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry came in with a rush fol- lowed by Nob. He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped: \'91I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!\'92\
\'91Black Riders!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91Where?\'92\
\'91Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.\'92\
\'91Which way did it go?\'92 asked Strider, suddenly and sharply.\
Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. \'91Go on!\'92 said Frodo. \'91This is a friend of Gandalf \'92s. I will explain later.\'92\
\'91It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,\'92 continued Merry. \'91I tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.\'92\
Strider looked at Merry with wonder. \'91You have a stout heart,\'92 he said; \'91but it was foolish.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 said Merry. \'91Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge.\
\
strider 227\
One was muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn\'92t hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terri- fied, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when something came behind me and I . . . I fell over.\'92\
\'91I found him, sir,\'92 put in Nob. \'91Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny\'92s house I thought I could see something in the Road. I couldn\'92t swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something, lifting it. I gave a shout, but when I got up to the spot there was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. \'91\'91I thought I had fallen into deep water,\'92\'92 he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ran back here like a hare.\'92\
\'91I am afraid that\'92s true,\'92 said Merry, \'91though I don\'92t know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which I can\'92t remember. I went to pieces. I don\'92t know what came over me.\'92\
\'91I do,\'92 said Strider. \'91The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before we leave Bree.\'92\
\'91What will happen?\'92 said Merry. \'91Will they attack the inn?\'92\
\'91No, I think not,\'92 said Strider. \'91They are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people \'96 not until they are des- perate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they left him.\'92\
\
228 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91We seem to have enemies all round,\'92 said Frodo. \'91What are we to do?\'92\
\'91Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.\'92\
While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper. Merry was still read- ing and pondering Gandalf\'92s letter when Strider and Nob returned.\
\'91Well Masters,\'92 said Nob, \'91I\'92ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag \'96 Underhill, sir,\'92 he added with a grin.\
Pippin laughed. \'91Very life-like!\'92 he said. \'91But what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise?\'92\
\'91We shall see,\'92 said Strider. \'91Let us hope to hold the fort till morning.\'92\
\'91Good night to you,\'92 said Nob, and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors.\
Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear. The Sickle* was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.\
The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.\
\'91Jumped over the Moon!\'92 chuckled Merry as he rolled him- self in his blanket. \'91Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish\
* The Hobbits\'92 name for the Plough or Great Bear.\
\
strider 229\
I had been there to see. The worthies of Bree will be dis- cussing it a hundred years hence.\'92\
\'91I hope so,\'92 said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep.\
\
Chapter 11\
A KNIFE IN THE DARK\
As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river-bank. The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.\
The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.\
There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.\
\'91Open, in the name of Mordor!\'92 said a voice thin and menacing.\
At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.\
At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the night like fire on a hill-top.\
\
a knife in the dark 231 awake! fear! fire! foes! awake!\
Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the doorstep. \'91No, no, no!\'92 he was crying. \'91No, not me! I haven\'92t got it!\'92 It was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.\
fear! fire! foes!\
The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.\
awake! awake!\
Far away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading.\
The black figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow! Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.\

In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement.\
Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming through the open window.\
As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces.\
Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he said), but he had never heard a sound.\
\'91Never has such a thing happened in my time!\'92 he cried, raising his hands in horror. \'91Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?\'92\
\'91Dark times,\'92 said Strider. \'91But for the present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed in a few minutes.\'92\
Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them a \'91bite\'92. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were gone: not only Merry\'92s ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place.\
Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They\
\
a knife in the dark 233\
might as well set out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength and courage.\
\'91Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,\'92 he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. \'91We should not go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you prepared to carry on your backs?\'92\
\'91As much as we must,\'92 said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).\
\'91I can carry enough for two,\'92 said Sam defiantly.\
\'91Can\'92t anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91Can\'92t we get a couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? I don\'92t suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,\'92 he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it.\
\'91I doubt it,\'92 said the landlord unhappily. \'91The two or three riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they\'92re gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there are very few of them in Bree, and they won\'92t be for sale. But I\'92ll do what I can. I\'92ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Strider reluctantly, \'91you had better do that. I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.\'92\
\'91There is one crumb of comfort,\'92 said Merry, \'91and more than a crumb, I hope: we can have breakfast while we wait \'96 and sit down to it. Let\'92s get hold of Nob!\'92\
***\
\

In the end there was more than three hours\'92 delay. Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood \'96 except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. \'91A poor old half-starved creature it is,\'92 said Bob; \'91but he won\'92t part with it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you\'92re placed, not if I knows Bill Ferny.\'92\
\'91Bill Ferny?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Isn\'92t there some trick? Wouldn\'92t the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?\'92\
\'91I wonder,\'92 said Strider. \'91But I cannot imagine any animal running home to him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master Ferny\'92s: just a way of increas- ing his profits from the affair. The chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death\'92s door. But there does not seem any choice. What does he want for it?\'92\
Bill Ferny\'92s price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at least three times the pony\'92s value in those parts. It proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear.\
As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree-land. Merry\'92s ponies had escaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well- off. But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom\'92s ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so on the whole they were lucky: they\
\
a knife in the dark 235\
missed a dark and dangerous journey. But they never came to Rivendell.\
However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny\'92s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell on him at once.\
\'91If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,\'92 said Butterbur angrily, \'91you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!\'92 But it appeared that he was nobody\'92s friend, and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party.\
After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was close on ten o\'92clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo\'92s vanishing trick; the appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants of Bree and Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road to see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows.\
Strider had changed his mind, and had decided to leave Bree by the main road. Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, and to prevent them from trespassing.\
They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with many thanks. \'91I hope we shall meet again\
\
236 the fellowship of the ring\
some day, when things are merry once more,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for a while.\'92\
They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. \'91Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting,\'92 he said. \'91But I reckon I\'92ll miss them both before long.\'92\
The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. But as they drew near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the village. In one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.\
\'91So that\'92s where that southerner is hiding!\'92 he thought. \'91He looks more than half like a goblin.\'92\
Over the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat.\
\'91Morning, Longshanks!\'92 he said. \'91Off early? Found some friends at last?\'92 Strider nodded, but did not answer.\
\'91Morning, my little friends!\'92 he said to the others. \'91I sup- pose you know who you\'92ve taken up with? That\'92s Stick-at- naught Strider, that is! Though I\'92ve heard other names not so pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don\'92t go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!\'92 He spat again.\
Sam turned quickly. \'91And you, Ferny,\'92 he said, \'91put your ugly face out of sight, or it will get hurt.\'92 With a sudden flick,\
\
a knife in the dark 237\
quick as lightning, an apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and curses came from behind the hedge. \'91Waste of a good apple,\'92 said Sam regret- fully, and strode on.\
At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles. It bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit-holes of Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay; Archet was hidden in the trees beyond.\
After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the North. \'91This is where we leave the open and take to cover,\'92 said Strider.\
\'91Not a \'91\'91short cut\'92\'92, I hope,\'92 said Pippin. \'91Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster.\'92\
\'91Ah, but you had not got me with you then,\'92 laughed Strider. \'91My cuts, short or long, don\'92t go wrong.\'92 He took a look up and down the Road. No one was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley.\
His plan, as far as they could understand it without know- ing the country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes. But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes themselves, and Strider\'92s description of them was not encouraging.\
However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it had not been for the disturbing events of the\
\
238 the fellowship of the ring\
night before, they would have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.\
\'91Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,\'92 he said; \'91though I don\'92t think he will follow us him- self. He knows the land round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don\'92t suppose they are far away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.\'92\
Whether because of Strider\'92s skill or for some other reason, they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few squirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came out of the Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of the Bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes.\
The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At first they made fair progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more dangerous. The marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires. The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair.\
\
a knife in the dark 239\
\'91I am being eaten alive!\'92 cried Pippin. \'91Midgewater! There are more midges than water!\'92\
\'91What do they live on when they can\'92t get hobbit?\'92 asked Sam, scratching his neck.\
They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their camping-place was damp, cold, and uncom- fortable; and the biting insects would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic.\
The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued them.\
As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off.\
\'91What is the light?\'92 he said to Strider, who had risen, and was standing, gazing ahead into the night.\
\'91I do not know,\'92 Strider answered. \'91It is too distant to make out. It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.\'92\
Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep.\
They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. The land before them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly flattened at the summit.\
\'91That is Weathertop,\'92 said Strider. \'91The Old Road, which\
\
240 the fellowship of the ring\
we have left far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it. I suppose we had better do so.\'92\
\'91What do you mean?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It is close to the Road.\'92\
\'91But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?\'92\
\'91Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway, unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop them- selves. It commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than they are.\'92\
The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. \'91You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!\'92 he said.\
\'91What do you advise us to do?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I think,\'92 answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, \'91I think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.\'92\
All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came down. The land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away.\
\
a knife in the dark 241\
At the day\'92s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its banks while the light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some stunted alder-trees by the shores of the stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night-hours a cold grey light lay on the land.\
Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used to much walking on short commons \'96 shorter at any rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.\
\'91Very odd,\'92 said Frodo, tightening his belt, \'91considering that there is actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.\'92\
\'91Do not speak of such things!\'92 said Strider quickly, and with surprising earnestness.\
The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. By night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and they were six days out from Bree.\
In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the Chetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and followed it southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible\
\
242 the fellowship of the ring\
from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge.\
\'91I wonder who made this path, and what for,\'92 said Merry, as they walked along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and closely set. \'91I am not sure that I like it: it has a \'96 well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?\'92\
\'91No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,\'92 answered Strider. \'91The Men of the West did not live here; though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Su\'88l they called it. It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown on the old hill\'92s head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance.\'92\
The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as in the ways of the wild. \'91Who was Gil-galad?\'92 asked Merry; but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low voice murmured:\
Gil-galad was an Elven-king.\
Of him the harpers sadly sing:\
the last whose realm was fair and free between the Mountains and the Sea.\
His sword was long, his lance was keen, his shining helm afar was seen;\
the countless stars of heaven\'92s field\
were mirrored in his silver shield.\
\
a knife in the dark 243\
But long ago he rode away,\
and where he dwelleth none can say; for into darkness fell his star\
in Mordor where the shadows are.\
The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam\'92s. \'91Don\'92t stop!\'92 said Merry.\
\'91That\'92s all I know,\'92 stammered Sam, blushing. \'91I learned it\
from Mr. Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my letters. He was mighty book-learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote poetry. He wrote what I have just said.\'92\
\'91He did not make it up,\'92 said Strider. \'91It is part of the lay that is called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have translated it. I never knew that.\'92\
\'91There was a lot more,\'92 said Sam, \'91all about Mordor. I didn\'92t learn that part, it gave me the shivers. I never thought I should be going that way myself !\'92\
\'91Going to Mordor!\'92 cried Pippin. \'91I hope it won\'92t come to that!\'92\
\'91Do not speak that name so loudly!\'92 said Strider.\
It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill. They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad. Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.\
On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides. There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The other three went on. After half an hour\'92s plodding climb Strider reached the crown\
\
244 the fellowship of the ring\
of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and rocky.\
On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient stone-work, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill- top; but there was no sign of any living thing.\
Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for the most part of lands empty and featureless, except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant water. Beneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with their eyes they saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds.\
\'91Well, here we are!\'92 said Merry. \'91And very cheerless and uninviting it looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don\'92t blame him for not waiting \'96 if he ever came here.\'92\
\'91I wonder,\'92 said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. \'91Even if he was a day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride very swiftly when need presses.\'92 Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his fingers. \'91This has been handled recently,\'92 he said. \'91What do you think of these marks?\'92\
On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches:   . \'91There seems to be a stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,\'92 he said.\
\'91The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin\
\
a knife in the dark 245\
branches,\'92 said Strider. \'91It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the marks might mean something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use runes, and they come here sometimes.\'92\
\'91What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?\'92 asked Merry.\
\'91I should say,\'92 answered Strider, \'91that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.\'92\
\'91I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.\'92\
\'91Perhaps,\'92 said Strider. \'91For myself, I believe that he was here, and was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell. He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own way to Rivendell, as best we can.\'92\
\'91How far is Rivendell?\'92 asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild and wide from Weathertop.\
\'91I don\'92t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the Forsaken Inn, a day\'92s journey east of Bree,\'92 answered Strider. \'91Some say it is so far, and some say other- wise. It is a strange road, and folk are glad to reach their journey\'92s end, whether the time is long or short. But I know how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune: twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight\'92s journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.\'92\
\'91A fortnight!\'92 said Frodo. \'91A lot may happen in that time.\'92 \'91It may,\'92 said Strider.\
\
246 the fellowship of the ring\
They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its south- ward edge. In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful Road, leading back westward \'96 to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched Strider\'92s arm.\
\'91Look,\'92 he said, pointing downwards.\
At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.\
\'91What is it?\'92 he whispered.\
\'91I do not know, but I fear the worst,\'92 answered Strider. Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and\
peered through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer bright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. \'91The enemy is here!\'92\
Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions.\
Sam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring of clear water in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. In the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked.\
\
a knife in the dark 247\
\'91I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,\'92 he said to Pippin. \'91Whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.\'92\
Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. \'91I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself,\'92 he said, hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints.\
\'91It is just as I feared,\'92 he said, when he came back. \'91Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers have been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers. At least one set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot now be certain, but I think there were many booted feet.\'92 He paused and stood in anxious thought.\
Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles away.\
\'91Hadn\'92t we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?\'92 he asked impatiently. \'91It is getting late, and I don\'92t like this hole: it makes my heart sink somehow.\'92\
\'91Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,\'92 answered Strider, looking up and considering the time and the weather. \'91Well, Sam,\'92 he said at last, \'91I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out of sight for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies. All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is here. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.\'92\
\'91Can the Riders see?\'92 asked Merry. \'91I mean, they seem usually to have used their noses rather than their eyes,\
\
248 the fellowship of the ring\
smelling for us, if smelling is the right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.\'92\
\'91I was too careless on the hill-top,\'92 answered Strider. \'91I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We can feel their presence \'96 it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,\'92 he added, and his voice sank to a whisper, \'91the Ring draws them.\'92\
\'91Is there no escape then?\'92 said Frodo, looking round wildly. \'91If I move I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!\'92\
Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. \'91There is still hope,\'92 he said. \'91You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in the wilderness.\'92\
\'91Maybe,\'92 muttered Sam. \'91It is also as good a way of saying \'91\'91here we are\'92\'92 as I can think of, bar shouting.\'92\
Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and it grew cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten anything since break- fast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world.\
\
a knife in the dark 249\
Rangers passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few words to spare for strangers.\
\'91I don\'92t see how our food can be made to last,\'92 said Frodo. \'91We have been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no feast; but we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and perhaps more.\'92\
\'91There is food in the wild,\'92 said Strider; \'91berry, root, and herb; and I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work, and we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables of Elrond\'92s house!\'92\
The cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars. Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.\
As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew many histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, and where he had learned all this lore.\
\'91Tell us of Gil-galad,\'92 said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end of a story of the Elf-kingdoms. \'91Do you know any more of that old lay that you spoke of ?\'92\
\'91I do indeed,\'92 answered Strider. \'91So also does Frodo, for it concerns us closely.\'92 Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the fire.\
\
250 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,\'92 said Frodo slowly. \'91Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land of\'97\'97\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Strider interrupting, \'91I do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we win through to the house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.\'92\
\'91Then tell us some other tale of the old days,\'92 begged Sam; \'91a tale about the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly like to hear more about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91I will tell you the tale of Tinu\uc0\u32 \u769 viel,\'92 said Strider, \'91in brief \'96 for it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there ar
\f0 e none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a fair tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may lift up your hearts.\'92 He was silent for some time, and then he began not to speak but to chant softly:\
The leaves were long, the grass was green, The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,\
And in the glade a light was seen Of stars in shadow shimmering.\

\f1 Tinu\uc0\u32 \u769 viel was dancing there To music of a pipe unseen,\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 And light of stars was in her hair, And in her raiment glimmering.\
There Beren came from mountains cold, And lost he wandered under leaves,\
And where the Elven-river rolled He walked alone and sorrowing.\
He peered between the hemlock-leaves And saw in wonder flowers of gold\
Upon her mantle and her sleeves,\
And her hair like shadow following.\
\
a knife in the dark 251\
Enchantment healed his weary feet That over hills were doomed to roam;\
And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, And grasped at moonbeams glistening.\
Through woven woods in Elvenhome She lightly fled on dancing feet,\
And left him lonely still to roam In the silent forest listening.\
He heard there oft the flying sound Of feet as light as linden-leaves,\
Or music welling underground, In hidden hollows quavering.\
Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, And one by one with sighing sound\
Whispering fell the beechen leaves\
In the wintry woodland wavering.\
He sought her ever, wandering far\
Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,\
By light of moon and ray of star In frosty heavens shivering. Her mantle glinted in the moon,\
As on a hill-top high and far\
She danced, and at her feet was strewn\
A mist of silver quivering.\
When winter passed, she came again,\
And her song released the sudden spring,\
Like rising lark, and falling rain, And melting water bubbling.\
He saw the elven-flowers spring About her feet, and healed again He longed by her to dance and sing\
Upon the grass untroubling.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Again she fled, but swift he came. Tinu\uc0\u32 \u769 viel! Tinu\u32 \u769 viel!\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 He called her by her Elvish name; And there she halted listening.\
One moment stood she, and a spell His voice laid on her: Beren came,\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 And doom fell on Tinu\uc0\u32 \u769 viel\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 That in his arms lay glistening.\
As Beren looked into her eyes Within the shadows of her hair, The trembling starlight of the skies\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 He saw there mirrored shimmering. Tinu\uc0\u32 \u769 viel the elven-fair,\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her shadowy hair\
And arms like silver glimmering.\
Long was the way that fate them bore, O\'92er stony mountains cold and grey,\
Through halls of iron and darkling door, And woods of nightshade morrowless.\
The Sundering Seas between them lay, And yet at last they met once more,\
And long ago they passed away In the forest singing sorrowless.\
Strider sighed and paused befor
\f1 e he spoke again. \'91That is a song,\'92 he said, \'91in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves, but is hard to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and Lu\uc0\u32 \u769  thien Tinu\u32 \u769  viel. Beren was a mortal man, but Lu\u32 \u769  thien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon Middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this world. As the stars above the mists of the N
\f0 orthern lands was her loveliness, and in her\
\
a knife in the dark 253\
face was a shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West coming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of T
\f1 hingol in the forest of Neldoreth. There he beheld Lu\uc0\u32 \u769  thien singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her Tinu\u32 \u769 viel, that is Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and they were parted long. Tinu\u32 \u769 viel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron, and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of Lu\u32 \u769 thien to Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinu\u32 \u769  viel. But she chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a brief time walk- ing alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, long ago, beyond the confines of this world. So it is that Lu\u32 \u769 thien Tinu\u32 \u769 viel alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of old descended among Men. There live still those of whom Lu\u32 \u769 thien was the foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of Rivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and Lu\u32 \u769  thien was born Dior Thingol\'92s heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Ea\u32 \u776 rendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow. And of Ea\u32 \u776 rendil came the Kings of Nu\u32 \u769 menor, that is Westernesse.\'92\

\f0 As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes\
\
254 the fellowship of the ring\
shone, and his voice was rich and deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top faded.\
The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. \'91Look!\'92 said Merry. \'91The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.\'92\
The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glim- mer of the moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.\
Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill intently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell.\
\'91I don\'92t know what it is,\'92 he said, \'91but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn\'92t go outside this dell for any money; I felt that some- thing was creeping up the slope.\'92\
\'91Did you see anything?\'92 asked Frodo, springing to his feet. \'91No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn\'92t stop to look.\'92\
\'91I saw something,\'92 said Merry; \'91or I thought I did \'96 away\
westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be moving this way.\'92\
\'91Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!\'92 cried Strider. \'91Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!\'92 For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with\
their backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out aloud.\
\'91Hush!\'92 whispered Strider. \'91What\'92s that?\'92 gasped Pippin at the same moment.\
\
a knife in the dark 255\
Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.\
Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw them- selves flat on the ground. Sam shrank to Frodo\'92s side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.\
Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others:\
\
256 the fellowship of the ring\
his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.\
At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it.\
\
Chapter 12 FLIGHT TO THE FORD\
When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately. He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. His three companions were bend- ing over him.\
\'91What has happened? Where is the pale king?\'92 he asked wildly.\
They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He heard Frodo\'92s voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.\
Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.\
\'91I am not a Black Rider, Sam,\'92 he said gently, \'91nor in league with them. I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.\'92\
When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of\
\
258 the fellowship of the ring\
concern, and shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. \'91Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!\'92 he said. Then he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him. \'91I think I understand things better now,\'92 he said in a low voice. \'91There seem only to have been five of the enemy. Why they were not all here, I don\'92t know; but I don\'92t think they expected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will. We shall see!\'92\
Sam choked with tears. \'91Don\'92t despair!\'92 said Strider. \'91You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am away!\'92 He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.\
Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.\
\'91Look!\'92 he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash. \'91This was the stroke of Frodo\'92s sword,\'92 he said. \'91The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth.\'92\
\'91And more deadly to Frodo was this!\'92 He stooped again\
\
flight to the ford 259\
and lifted up a long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider\'92s hand. \'91Alas!\'92 he cried. \'91It was this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what I can.\'92\
He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.\
\'91These leaves,\'92 he said, \'91I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.\'92 He crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. \'91It is fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.\'92\
He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo\'92s shoulder. The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they\
\
260 the fellowship of the ring\
would now manage to continue their journey. He felt too weak to stand.\
The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible. \'91I think now,\'92 said Strider, \'91that the enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.\'92\
As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fat- ter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny\'92s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life.\
They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the Road, but it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.\
They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. Trem- bling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between. The grass was\
\
flight to the ford 261\
scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo\'92s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and heavy- hearted.\
Before the first day\'92s march was over Frodo\'92s pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place?\
At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. Strider now turned their course again north- eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.\
\'91I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,\'92 said Strider. \'91We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater\
\
262 the fellowship of the ring\
away in the South. Some call it the Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses.\'92\
\'91What is that other river we can see far away there?\'92 asked Merry.\
\'91That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,\'92 answered Strider. \'91The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us.\'92\
Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.\
They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore.\
Before long he came hurrying back. \'91I can see no sign of the enemy,\'92 he said, \'91and I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something very strange.\'92\
He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. \'91I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,\'92 he said. \'91It is a beryl, an elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; but it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer token.\'92\
***\
\
flight to the ford 263\
At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills.\
The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo\'92s account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near the Trolls\'92 wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot.\
\'91Who lives in this land?\'92 he asked. \'91And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Strider. \'91Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar. But all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies on the land.\'92\
\'91Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?\'92 asked Peregrin. \'91The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that sort.\'92\
\'91The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,\'92 said Strider; \'91and many more things than I can tell are remem- bered in Rivendell.\'92\
\'91Have you often been to Rivendell?\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91I have,\'92 said Strider. \'91I dwelt there once, and still I return\
\
264 the fellowship of the ring\
when I may. There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in\
peace, even in the fair house of Elrond.\'92\
The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. The travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood.\
The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a pathless country, encum- bered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo\'92s sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales. They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away north- wards out of their course. Strider seemed to be getting anxi- ous: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It went on raining.\
That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the\
\
flight to the ford 265 Shire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall\
black shadows that stood looking over the hedge.\
In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie of the land.\
When he returned he was not reassuring. \'91We have come too far to the north,\'92 he said, \'91and we must find some way to turn back southwards again. If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little known to me. We could per- haps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.\'92\
The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or climbing over it.\
They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground\
\
266 the fellowship of the ring\
shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim.\
\'91We cannot go any further,\'92 said Merry to Strider. \'91I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?\'92\
\'91We shall see,\'92 answered Strider. \'91There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.\'92\
\'91What is the matter with my master?\'92 asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider. \'91His wound was small, and it is already closed. There\'92s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.\'92\
\'91Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,\'92 said Strider, \'91and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out. But do not give up hope, Sam!\'92\
Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.\
The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but they longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the right direction. If they\
\
flight to the ford 267\
went on, down the further side of the ridge, they would have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to them.\
\'91We must make for the Road again,\'92 he said. \'91We cannot hope to find a path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only way to the Ford.\'92\
As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny\'92s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.\
Pippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and called to them. \'91There is a path here!\'92 he cried.\
When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way.\
They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the corner of a rocky shoulder of the hill.\
\
268 the fellowship of the ring\
When they came to the corner they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.\
Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go far, for on the floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots.\
\'91Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!\'92 said Pippin. \'91Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who made the path \'96 and we had better get off it quick.\'92\
\'91There is no need, I think,\'92 said Strider, coming out. \'91It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I don\'92t think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.\'92\
The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo\'92s pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both looked terrified.\
\'91There are trolls!\'92 Pippin panted. \'91Down in a clearing in the woods not far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very large!\'92\
\'91We will come and look at them,\'92 said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.\
The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light. They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath.\
\
flight to the ford 269\
There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was stooping, and the other two stood staring at him.\
Strider walked forward unconcernedly. \'91Get up, old stone!\'92 he said, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll.\
Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed. \'91Well!\'92 he said. \'91We are forgetting our family history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.\'92\
\'91I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!\'92 said Pippin. He knew the story well. Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it. Even now he looked at the stone trolls with sus- picion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again.\
\'91You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,\'92 said Strider. \'91It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird\'92s nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!\'92\
They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the re- minder of Bilbo\'92s first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. They rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls\'92 large legs.\
\'91Won\'92t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?\'92 said Merry, when they had finished. \'91We haven\'92t had a song or a tale for days.\'92\
\'91Not since Weathertop,\'92 said Frodo. The others looked at him. \'91Don\'92t worry about me!\'92 he added. \'91I feel much better, but I don\'92t think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig some- thing out of his memory.\'92\
\'91Come on, Sam!\'92 said Merry. \'91There\'92s more stored in your head than you let on about.\'92\
\
270 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91I don\'92t know about that,\'92 said Sam. \'91But how would this suit? It ain\'92t what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But these old images here brought it to my mind.\'92 Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.\

And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;\
For many a year he had gnawed it near, For meat was hard to come by.\
Done by! Gum by!\
In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,\
And meat was hard to come by.\
Up came Tom with his big boots on. Said he to Troll: \'91Pray, what is yon?\
For it looks like the shin o\'92 my nuncle Tim, As should be a-lyin\'92 in graveyard.\
Caveyard! Paveyard!\
This many a year has Tim been gone,\
And I thought he were lyin\'92 in graveyard.\'92\
\'91My lad,\'92 said Troll, \'91this bone I stole. But what be bones that lie in a hole?\
Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o\'92 lead, Afore I found his shinbone.\
Tinbone! Thinbone!\
He can spare a share for a poor old troll,\
For he don\'92t need his shinbone.\'92\
Said Tom: \'91I don\'92t see why the likes o\'92 thee Without axin\'92 leave should go makin\'92 free\
With the shank or the shin o\'92 my father\'92s kin; So hand the old bone over!\
Rover! Trover!\
Though dead he be, it belongs to he;\
So hand the old bone over!\'92\
\

\'91For a couple o\'92 pins,\'92 says Troll, and grins, \'91I\'92ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.\
A bit o\'92 fresh meat will go down sweet! I\'92ll try my teeth on thee now.\
Hee now! See now!\
I\'92m tired o\'92 gnawing old bones and skins;\
I\'92ve a mind to dine on thee now.\'92\
But just as he thought his dinner was caught, He found his hands had hold of naught.\
Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind And gave him the boot to larn him.\
Warn him! Darn him!\
A bump o\'92 the boot on the seat, Tom thought,\
Would be the way to larn him.\
But harder than stone is the flesh and bone Of a troll that sits in the hills alone.\
As well set your boot to the mountain\'92s root, For the seat of a troll don\'92t feel it.\
Peel it! Heal it!\
Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,\
And he knew his toes could feel it.\
Tom\'92s leg is game, since home he came, And his bootless foot is lasting lame;\
But Troll don\'92t care, and he\'92s still there With the bone he boned from its owner.\
Doner! Boner!\
Troll\'92s old seat is still the same,\
And the bone he boned from its owner!\
\'91Well, that\'92s a warning to us all!\'92 laughed Merry. \'91It is as well you used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!\'92\
\'91Where did you come by that, Sam?\'92 asked Pippin. \'91I\'92ve never heard those words before.\'92\
Sam muttered something inaudible. \'91It\'92s out of his own\
\
272 the fellowship of the ring\
head, of course,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he\'92s a jester. He\'92ll end up by becoming a wizard \'96 or a warrior!\'92\
\'91I hope not,\'92 said Sam. \'91I don\'92t want to be neither!\'92\
In the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many years before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather- covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes and secret marks.\
\'91There!\'92 said Merry. \'91That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls\'92 gold was hidden. How much is left of Bilbo\'92s share, I wonder, Frodo?\'92\
Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous, nor less easy to part with. \'91None at all,\'92 he said. \'91Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it came from robbers.\'92\
The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead.\
They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten\
\
flight to the ford 273\
way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some thirty feet below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast, with a light clippety-clippety-clip. Then faintly, as if it was blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of small bells tinkling.\
\'91That does not sound like a Black Rider\'92s horse!\'92 said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face.\
The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were stud- ded with gems like living stars. The rider\'92s cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.\
Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up 
\f1 towards the thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: Ai na vedui Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No others that
\f0  dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.\
Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the\
\
274 the fellowship of the ring\
bushes and hurried down to the Road. \'91This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,\'92 said Strider.\
\'91Hail, and well met at last!\'92 said the Elf-lord to Frodo. \'91I was sent from Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the road.\'92\
\'91Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?\'92 cried Frodo joyfully.\
\'91No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,\'92 answered Glorfindel. \'91Elrond received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,* learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.\
\'91It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.\'92\
While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deep- ened. Frodo felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened,\
* The Brandywine River.\
\
flight to the ford 275\
and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam\'92s arm.\
\'91My master is sick and wounded,\'92 said Sam angrily. \'91He can\'92t go on riding after nightfall. He needs rest.\'92\
Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.\
Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at it.\
\'91There are evil things written on this hilt,\'92 he said; \'91though maybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can \'96 but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest.\'92\
He searched the wound on Frodo\'92s shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what he learned dis- quieted him. But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his friends\'92 faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength returned.\
\'91You shall ride my horse,\'92 said Glorfindel. \'91I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle-skirts, and you must sit as tight as you can. But you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him to bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival.\'92\
\'91No, he will not!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I shall not ride him, if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in danger.\'92\
Glorfindel smiled. \'91I doubt very much,\'92 he said, \'91if your\
\
276 the fellowship of the ring\
friends would be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that brings us all in peril.\'92\
To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel\'92s white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others\'92 burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.\
They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the clouds and mists of the night were gone.\
\'91Drink this!\'92 said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.\
They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts during the day\'92s march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down towards\
\
flight to the ford 277\
the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.\
But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo\'92s pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world seemed less pale and empty.\
The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.\
\'91Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,\'92 said Glorfindel; \'91for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.\'92\
The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.\
\
278 the fellowship of the ring\
There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.\
\'91Fly!\'92 he called. \'91Fly! The enemy is upon us!\'92\
The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. Glorfindel and Strider followed as rearguard. They were only half way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and then another; then again two more.\
\'91Ride forward! Ride!\'92 cried Glorfindel to Frodo.\
He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist. Sud- denly he knew in his heart that they were silently command- ing him to wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it.\
\'91Ride on! Ride on!\'92 cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!\
At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo; two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape. They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converged with his.\
\
flight to the ford 279\
Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords were naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they called to him with fell voices.\
Fear now filled all Frodo\'92s mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse\'92s mane. The wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right before the face of the foremost Rider.\
Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford.\
But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the water\'92s edge below, and Frodo\'92s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.\
Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at the water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished his sword.\
\'91Go back!\'92 he cried. \'91Go back to the Land of Mordor, and\
\
280 the fellowship of the ring\
follow me no more!\'92 His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter. \'91Come back! Come back!\'92 they called. \'91To Mordor we will take you!\'92\
\'91Go back!\'92 he whispered.\
\'91The Ring! The Ring!\'92 they cried with deadly voices; and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two others.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91By Elbereth and Lu\uc0\u32 \u769 thien the Fair,\'92 said Frodo with a last effort, lif
\f0 ting up his sword, \'91you shall have neither the Ring nor me!\'92\
Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. His sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.\
At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests, and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew back in dismay.\
With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world.\
The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river\
\
flight to the ford 281\
as it carried them away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more.\

Chapter 1 MANY MEETINGS\
Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a waterfall.\
\'91Where am I, and what is the time?\'92 he said aloud to the ceiling.\
\'91In the house of Elrond, and it is ten o\'92clock in the morn- ing,\'92 said a voice. \'91It is the morning of October the twenty- fourth, if you want to know.\'92\
\'91Gandalf !\'92 cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting in a chair by the open window.\
\'91Yes,\'92 he said, \'91I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after all the absurd things you have done since you left home.\'92\
Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous \'91short cut\'92 through the Old Forest; the \'91accident\'92 at The Prancing Pony; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of Gandalf \'92s pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.\
\'91Where\'92s Sam?\'92 Frodo asked at length. \'91And are the others all right?\'92\
\
286 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Yes, they are all safe and sound,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91Sam was here until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.\'92\
\'91What happened at the Ford?\'92 said Frodo. \'91It all seemed so dim, somehow; and it still does.\'92\
\'91Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91The wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.\'92\
\'91You seem to know a great deal already,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I have not spoken to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible, and afterwards there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?\'92\
\'91You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,\'92 said Gandalf gently, \'91and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! Though I said \'91\'91absurd\'92\'92 just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you \'96 and of the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such dangers, still bearing the Ring.\'92\
\'91We should never have done it without Strider,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But we needed you. I did not know what to do without you.\'92 \'91I was delayed,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and that nearly proved our\
ruin. And yet I am not sure: it may have been better so.\'92\
\'91I wish you would tell me what happened!\'92\
\'91All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry\
about anything today, by Elrond\'92s orders.\'92\
\'91But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which\
are quite as tiring,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I am wide awake now, and I remember so many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at least.\'92\
\'91You will soon hear all you wish to know,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91We shall have a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I will only say that I was held captive.\'92\
\'91You?\'92 cried Frodo.\
\
many meetings 287\
\'91Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,\'92 said the wizard solemnly. \'91There are many powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!\'92\
\'91Then you knew of the Riders already \'96 before I met them?\'92\
\'91Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at once. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but that story must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Frodo, \'91it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at first. Sam never quite trusted him, I think, not at any rate until we met Glorfindel.\'92\
Gandalf smiled. \'91I have heard all about Sam,\'92 he said. \'91He has no more doubts now.\'92\
\'91I am glad,\'92 said Frodo. \'91For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I didn\'92t know that any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don\'92t know much about Men in the Shire, except perhaps the Bree-landers.\'92\
\'91You don\'92t know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.\'92\
\'91Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings?\'92 said Frodo in wonder. \'91I thought they had all vanished long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger.\'92\
\
288 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Only a Ranger!\'92 cried Gandalf. \'91My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of the West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest.\'92\
\'91I suppose not,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I hope I shan\'92t have to go any further. It is very pleasant just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I want.\'92\
He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. \'91I have been reckoning,\'92 he said, \'91and I can\'92t bring the total up to October the twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must have reached the Ford by the twentieth.\'92\
\'91You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91How do the side and shoulder feel now?\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 Frodo answered. \'91They don\'92t feel at all: which is an improvement, but\'92 \'96 he made an effort \'96 \'91I can move my arm again a little. Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,\'92 he added, touching his left hand with his right.\
\'91Good!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in.\'92\
\'91Days?\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you from the Ford on the night of the twentieth, and that is where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried, and it was working inwards.\'92\
Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider\'92s hands. \'91Don\'92t\

be alarmed!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days.\'92\
\'91What would they have done to me?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91What were the Riders trying to do?\'92\
\'91They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker and under their com- mand. You would have become a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand.\'92\
\'91Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!\'92 said Frodo faintly. \'91I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!\'92\
\'91Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91not to mention courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you. You could see them, and they could see you.\'92\
\'91I know,\'92 said Frodo. \'91They were terrible to behold! But why could we all see their horses?\'92\
\'91Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living.\'92\
\'91Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel. The dogs howl and the geese scream at them.\'92\
\'91Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels\
\
290 the fellowship of the ring\
are wraiths! There are orcs and trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are under his sway. And their number is growing daily.\'92\
\'91What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?\'92\
\'91Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will they listen to him or serve him. And here in Riven- dell there live still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.\'92\
\'91I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?\'92\
\'91Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the mighty of the Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord of a house of princes. Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind in the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if things go on as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength.\
\'91Still,\'92 he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, \'91we must keep up our courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.\'92\
\'91I haven\'92t any courage to keep up,\'92 said Frodo, \'91but I am not worried at the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan\'92t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.\'92\
Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo. The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully awake and aware. He was smiling,\
\
many meetings 291\
and there seemed to be little wrong with him. But to the wizard\'92s eye there was a faint change, just a hint as it were of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet.\
\'91Still that must be expected,\'92 said Gandalf to himself. \'91He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.\'92\
\'91You look splendid,\'92 he said aloud. \'91I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to over- take, and too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not withstand all the Nine at once.\
\'91When the Ringwraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood appeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the others with flaming brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with mad- ness. Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.\'92\
\'91And is that the end of the Black Riders?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91No,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Their horses must have perished, and without them they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths\
\
292 the fellowship of the ring\
themselves cannot be so easily destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was standing guard beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or worse. Elrond\'92s folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.\'92\
\'91Who made the flood?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91Elrond commanded it,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91The river of this valley is under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty Mountains.\'92\
\'91Yes, it all comes back to me now,\'92 said Frodo: \'91the tremen- dous roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. But now we are safe!\'92\
Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. \'91Yes, you are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in places of honour.\'92\
\'91Splendid!\'92 said Frodo. \'91It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.\'92\
\'91Well, there are many reasons why they should,\'92 said Gandalf, smiling. \'91I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer. And you are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.\'92\
\'91Dear Bilbo!\'92 said Frodo sleepily. \'91I wonder where he is. I wish he was here and could hear all about it. It would have\
\
many meetings 293 made him laugh. The cow jumped over the Moon! And the\
poor old troll!\'92 With that he fell fast asleep.\
Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, \'91a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all\'92. Merely to be there was a cure for weari- ness, fear, and sadness.\
As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.\
\'91Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,\'92 he said to his reflection. \'91But now for a merry meeting!\'92 He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.\
At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.\
\'91Hullo, Sam!\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91It\'92s warm!\'92 said Sam. \'91Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through the long nights. But glory and trum- pets!\'92 he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. \'91It\'92s fine to see you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.\'92\
\'91I am ready,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Let\'92s go and look for the rest of the party!\'92\
\
294 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91I can take you to them, sir,\'92 said Sam. \'91It\'92s a big house this, and very peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you\'92ll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music and the singing \'96 not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here. But I\'92m getting to know some of the ways of the place.\'92\
\'91I know what you have been doing, Sam,\'92 said Frodo, taking his arm. \'91But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart\'92s content. Come on, guide me round the corners!\'92\
Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud, and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond\'92s gardens.\
\'91Hurray!\'92 cried Pippin, springing up. \'91Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!\'92\
\'91Hush!\'92 said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. \'91Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world. We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.\'92\
\'91Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,\'92 said Pippin. \'91He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the right song for the occasion.\'92\
\'91I feel like singing myself,\'92 laughed Frodo. \'91Though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking.\'92\
\'91That will soon be cured,\'92 said Pippin. \'91You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.\'92\
\
many meetings 295\
\'91More than a meal! A feast!\'92 said Merry. \'91As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.\'92 He had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells.\
The hall of Elrond\'92s house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.\
Frodo looked at them in wonder; for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and power.\
Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire.\
Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.\
The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.\
In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of woman- hood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his\
\
296 the fellowship of the ring\
close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver.\

\f1 So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of Lu\uc0\u32 \u769  thien had come on earth again; and she was called Undo\u32 \u769 miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother\'92s kin, in Lo\u32 \u769 rien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Riven- dell to her father\'92s house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry; for they rode often far afield w
\f0 ith the Rangers of the North, forgetting never their mother\'92s torment in the dens of the orcs.\
Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at Elrond\'92s table among all these folk so high and fair. Though he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours.\
He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper end of one of the side-tables close to the dais. He could see no sign of Strider.\
Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appear- ance, richly dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was\
\
many meetings 297\
white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him.\
\'91Welcome and well met!\'92 said the dwarf, turning towards him. T
\f1 hen he actually rose from his seat and bowed. \'91Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in at your service,\'92 he said, and bowed still lower.\
\'91Frodo Baggins at your service and your family\'92s,\'92 said Frodo correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. \'91Am I right in guessing that you are the Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, one of the twelve companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield?\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91Quite right,\'92 answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. \'91And I do not ask, for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.\'92\
\'91Thank you very much,\'92 said Frodo.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in. \'91I wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not in
\f0 quire too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?\'92\
\'91I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,\'92 said Frodo politely. He guessed that even in Elrond\'92s house the matter of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time. \'91But I am equally curious,\'92 he added, \'91to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.\'92\

\f1 Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in looked at him. \'91If you have not heard, I think we will not speak yet of that eit
\f0 her. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe, and then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be told.\'92\
Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Sh
\f1 ire, apart from the Ring, seemed small and far-away and unim- portant, while Glo\uc0\u32 \u769  in had much to tell of events in the northern regions of Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men,\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
298 the fellowship of the ring\
and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Indeed,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, \'91if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are valiant me
\f0 n and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their tolls are high,\'92 he added with a shake of his head; \'91and like Beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.\'92\
\'91And what of your own people?\'92 asked Frodo.\

\f1 \'91There is much to tell, good and bad,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in; \'91yet it is mostly good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me whe
\f0 n you are weary! Dwarves\'92 tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork, they say.\'92\

\f1 And with that Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weari- ness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to hear that Da\u32 \u769 in was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Glo\u32 \u769 in, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur was n
\f0 ow so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him.\

\f1 \'91And what has become of Balin and Ori and O\uc0\u32 \u769  in?\'92 asked Frodo.\
A shadow passed over Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in\'92s face. \'91We do not know,\'92 he\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
many meetings 299\
answered. \'91It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great lab
\f0 ours in Dale and under the Moun- tain. \'91We have done well,\'92 he said. \'91But in metal-work we cannot rival our fathers, many of whose secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You should see the stone- paved roads of many colours! And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the terraces and towers upon the Mountain\'92s sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle.\'92\
\'91I will come and see them, if ever I can,\'92 said Frodo. \'91How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!\'92\

\f1 Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in looked at Frodo and smiled. \'91You were very fond of Bilbo were you not?\'92 he asked.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91Yes,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91I would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world.\'92\
At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall, and the company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side.\
Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. \'91This is the Hall of Fire,\'92 said the wizard. \'91Here you will hear many songs and tales \'96 if you can keep awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people come here who wish for peace, and thought. There is always a fire here, all the year round, but there is little other light.\'92\
\
300 the fellowship of the ring\
As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, Elvish minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face.\
Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. \'91Awake, little master!\'92 he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. \'91Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,\'92 he said. \'91Here is a friend that you have long missed.\'92\
The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.\
\'91Bilbo!\'92 cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.\
\'91Hullo, Frodo my lad!\'92 said Bilbo. \'91So you have got here at last. I hoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself ?\'92\
\'91Why weren\'92t you there?\'92 cried Frodo. \'91And why haven\'92t I been allowed to see you before?\'92\
\'91Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by your side with Sam each day. But as for the feast, I don\'92t go in for such things much now. And I had something else to do.\'92\
\'91What were you doing?\'92\
\'91Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!\'92 he said, cocking an eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see. \'91Wake up! I was not asleep, Master Elrond. If you want to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you\
\
many meetings 301\
have disturbed me \'96 in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck over a line 
\f1 or two, and was thinking about them; but now I don\'92t suppose I shall ever get them right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out of my head. I shall have to get my friend the Du\uc0\u32 \u769  nadan to help me. Where is he?\'92\

\f0 Elrond laughed. \'91He shall be found,\'92 he said. \'91Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking.\'92 Messen- gers were sent to find Bilbo\'92s friend, though none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast.\
In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of himself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the time towards Rivendell.\
\'91I got here without much adventure,\'92 he said, \'91and after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan\'92t travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here I have been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of my book. And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to please me, I think; for, of course, they aren\'92t really good enough for Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn\'92t seem to pass here: it just is. A remarkable place altogether.\
\'91I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out o
\f1 f the South, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan has told me more. Fancy that ring of m
\f0 ine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times of going back to Hobbi- ton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me:\
\
302 the fellowship of the ring\
Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught me tottering about in the Wild.\
\'91And Gandalf said: \'91\'91The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again.\'92\'92 Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am fright- fully glad to see you safe and sound.\'92 He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.\
\'91Have you got it here?\'92 he asked in a whisper. \'91I can\'92t help feeling curious, you know, after all I\'92ve heard. I should very much like just to peep at it again.\'92\
\'91Yes, I\'92ve got it,\'92 answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluc- tance. \'91It looks just the same as ever it did.\'92\
\'91Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,\'92 said Bilbo.\
When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his distress and amaze- ment he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him.\
The music and singing round them seemed to falter, and a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo\'92s face and passed his hand across his eyes. \'91I understand now,\'92 he said. \'91Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden; sorry about everything. Don\'92t adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can\'92t be helped. I wonder if it\'92s any good trying to finish my book? But don\'92t let\'92s worry about it now \'96 let\'92s have some real News! Tell me all about the Shire!\'92\
Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory. The light and music of Rivendell\
\
many meetings 303\
was about him again. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell \'96 aided and corrected now and again by Sam \'96 was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Suddenly Bilbo looked up. \'91Ah, there you are at last, Du\uc0\u32 \u769  n- adan!
\f0 \'92 he cried.\
\'91Strider!\'92 said Frodo. \'91You seem to have a lot of names.\'92\
\'91Well, Strider is one that I haven\'92t heard before, anyway,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91What do you call him that for?\'92\
\'91They call me that in Bree,\'92 said Strider laughing, \'91and that is how I was introduced to him.\'92\

\f1 \'91And why do you call him Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91The Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91He is often called that here. But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know du\u32 \u769 n- adan: Man of the West, Nu\u32 \u769  meno\u32 \u769  rean. But this is not the time for lessons!\'92 He turned to Strider. \'91Where have you been, my friend? Why weren\'92t you at the feast? The Lady Arwen was there.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. \'91I know,\'92 he said. \'91But often I must put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.\'92\
\'91Well, my dear fellow,\'92 said Bilbo, \'91now you\'92ve heard the news, can\'92t you spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent. Elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am stuck. Let\'92s go off into a corner and polish it up!\'92\
Strider smiled. \'91Come then!\'92 he said. \'91Let me hear it!\'92\
Frodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep. He was alone and felt rather forlorn, although all about him the folk of Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon the music of the voices and the\
\
304 the fellowship of the ring\
instruments, and they gave no heed to anything else. Frodo began to listen.\
At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitu- dinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep.\
There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.\
Ea\uc0\u32 \u776 rendil was a mariner\
that tarried in Arvernien;\
he built a boat of timber felled\
in Nimbrethil to journey in;\
her sails he wove of silver fair,\
of silver were her lanterns made, her prow he fashioned like a swan, and light upon her banners laid.\
In panoply of ancient kings,\

\f1 \cf0 in chaine\uc0\u32 \u769 d rings he armoured him;\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 his shining shield was scored with runes to ward all wounds and harm from him; his bow was made of dragon-horn,\
his arrows shorn of ebony,\
of silver was his habergeon,\
\
many meetings 305\
his scabbard of chalcedony; his sword of steel was valiant, of adamant his helmet tall,\
an eagle-plume upon his crest, upon his breast an emerald.\
Beneath the Moon and under star\
he wandered far from northern strands, bewildered on enchanted ways\
beyond the days of mortal lands.\
From gnashing of the Narrow Ice where shadow lies on frozen hills,\
from nether heats and burning waste he turned in haste, and roving still\
on starless waters far astray\
at last he came to Night of Naught, and passed, and never sight he saw\
of shining shore nor light he sought. The winds of wrath came driving him, and blindly in the foam he fled\
from west to east, and errandless, unheralded he homeward sped.\
There flying Elwing came to him, and flame was in the darkness lit; more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcanet.\
The Silmaril she bound on him\
and crowned him with the living light, and dauntless then with burning brow he turned his prow; and in the night from Otherworld beyond the Sea\
there strong and free a storm arose,\
a wind of power in Tarmenel;\
by paths that seldom mortal goes\
his boat it bore with biting breath\
as might of death across the grey\
\

the fellowship of the ring\
and long-forsaken seas distressed: from east to west he passed away.\
Through Evernight he back was borne on black and roaring waves that ran o\'92er leagues unlit and foundered shores that drowned before the Days began, until he heard on strands of pearl where ends the world the music long, where ever-foaming billows roll\
the yellow gold and jewels wan. He saw the Mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon the knees of Valinor, and Eldamar\
beheld afar beyond the seas.\
A wanderer escaped from night\
to haven white he came at last,\
to Elvenhome the green and fair\
where keen the air, where pale as glass beneath the Hill of Ilmarin\
a-glimmer in a valley sheer\
the lamplit towers of Tirion\
are mirrored on the Shadowmere.\
He tarried there from errantry,\
and melodies they taught to him,\
and sages old him marvels told,\
and harps of gold they brought to him. They clothed him then in elven-white, and seven lights before him sent,\
as through the Calacirian\
to hidden land forlorn he went.\
He came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the countless years, and endless reigns the Elder King\
in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer;\
and words unheard were spoken then\
\
many meetings 307\
of folk of Men and Elven-kin,\
beyond the world were visions showed forbid to those that dwell therein.\
A ship then new they built for him of mithril and of elven-glass\
with shining prow; no shaven oar nor sail she bore on silver mast: the Silmaril as lantern light\
and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon by Elbereth\
herself was set, who thither came and wings immortal made for him, and laid on him undying doom,\
to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the Sun and light of Moon.\
From Evereven\'92s lofty hills\
where softly silver fountains fall\
his wings him bore, a wandering light, beyond the mighty Mountain Wall. From World\'92s End then he turned away, and yearned again to find afar\
his home through shadows journeying, and burning as an island star\
on high above the mists he came,\
a distant flame before the Sun,\
a wonder ere the waking dawn\
where grey the Norland waters run.\
And over Middle-earth he passed and heard at last the weeping sore of women and of elven-maids\
in Elder Days, in years of yore.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 But on him mighty doom was laid, till Moon should fade, an orbe\uc0\u32 \u769 d star to pass, and tarry never more\

on Hither Shores where mortals are; for ever still a herald on\

The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was seated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling and applauding.\
\'91Now we had better have it again,\'92 said an Elf.\
Bilbo got up and bowed. \'91I am flattered, Lindir,\'92 he said. \'91But it would be too tiring to repeat it all.\'92\
\'91Not too tiring for you,\'92 the Elves answered laughing. \'91You know you are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer your question at one hearing!\'92\
\'91What
\f1 !\'92 cried Bilbo. \'91You can\'92t tell which parts were mine, and which were the Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan\'92s?\'92\

\f0 \'91It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals,\'92 said the Elf.\
\'91Nonsense, Lindir,\'92 snorted Bilbo. \'91If you can\'92t distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They\'92re as different as peas and apples.\'92\
\'91Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,\'92 laughed Lindir. \'91Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other business.\'92\
\'91I won\'92t argue with you,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91I am sleepy after so much music and singing. I\'92ll leave you to guess, if you want to.\'92\
He got up and came towards Frodo. \'91Well, that\'92s over,\'92 he said in a low voice. \'91It went off better than I expected. I don\'92t often get asked for a second hearing. What did you think of it?\'92\
\'91I am not going to try and guess,\'92 said Frodo smiling.\
\'91You needn\'92t,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it important. I don\'92t know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above\
\
many meetings 309\
my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses about Ea\uc0\u32 \u776 rendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was right.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 said Frodo. \'91It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can\'92t explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something that I was dream- ing about. I didn\'92t understand that it was really you speaking until near the end.\'92\
\'91It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the Elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk?\'92\
\'91Can we?\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, as long as you don\'92t make a noise.\'92\
They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his delight in Bilbo\'92s company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the trees. Near him sat the Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was\
\
310 the fellowship of the ring\
thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then sud- denly it seemed to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart.\
He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the Elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. \'91It is a song to Elbereth,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come on!\'92\
He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gardens and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods.\
At last there came a knock on the door. \'91Begging your pardon,\'92 said Sam, putting in his head, \'91but I was just wonder- ing if you would be wanting anything.\'92\
\'91And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,\'92 replied Bilbo. \'91I guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed.\'92\
\'91Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear, and he only got up today for the first time.\'92\
\'91Quite right, Sam,\'92 laughed Bilbo. \'91You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should live to see your chapters of our story. Good night! I\'92ll take a walk, I think, and look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!\'92\
\
Chapter 2\
THE COUNCIL OF ELROND\
Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun rise above the far mountains, and shine down, slanting through the thin silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their peaks.\
On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. \'91Hullo! Good morning!\'92 said Bilbo. \'91Feel ready for the great council?\'92\
\'91I feel ready for anything,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91But most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into those pine-woods up there.\'92 He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north.\
\'91You may have a chance later,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But we cannot make any plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.\'92\
Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. \'91That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,\'92 cried Gandalf. \'91Come along now! Both you and Bilbo are wanted.\'92\
Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted Sam.\
Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the valley. The noise of bub- bling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo\
\
312 the fellowship of the ring\
his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.\
Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. Frodo saw Gl
\f1 orfindel and Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by his side, and presented him to the company, saying:\

\f0 \'91Here, my friends, is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. There was a younger dwarf at Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in\'92s side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond\'92s household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from C\u32 \u769 \u305 rdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thrandui
\f0 l, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.\
He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horse- back; and indeed though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.\
\'91Here,\'92 said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, \'91is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.\'92\
Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. Much was said of events in the world outside,\
\
the council of elrond 313\
espe
\f1 cially in the South, and in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours; but the tale of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in was new to him, and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their w
\f0 orks of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled.\

\f1 \'91It is now many years ago,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, \'91that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to be whispered in secret: it w
\f0 as said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue Khazad-du\'88m; and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return.\'92\

\f1 Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in sighed. \'91Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since the chil- dren of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazad-du\'88m for many lives of kings, save Thro\u32 \u769 r only, and he perished. At last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though Da\u32 \u769 in did not give leave will- ingly, he took with him Ori and O\u32 \u769  in and many of our folk, and they went away south.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria since.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Then about a year ago a messenger came to Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in, but not from Moria \'96 from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Da\u32 \u769 in to his gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for o
\f0 ur friendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. \'91\'91For Sauron knows,\'92\'92 said he, \'91\'91that one of these was known to you on a time.\'92\'92\
\'91At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer.\
\
314 the fellowship of the ring\
And then his fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. \'91\'91As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this,\'92\'92 he said: \'91\'91that you should find this thief,\'92\'92 such was his word, \'91\'91and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf-sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?\'92\'92\

\f1 \'91At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by shuddered, but Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in said: \'91\'91I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak.\'92\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91 \'91\'91Consider well, but not too long,\'92\'92 said he.\
\'91 \'91\'91T
\f1 he time of my thought is my own to spend,\'92\'92 answered Da\uc0\u32 \u769  in.\

\f0 \'91 \'91\'91For the present,\'92\'92 said he, and rode into the darkness.\
\'91Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91And so I have been sent at last by Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and draw
\f0 s nearer. We discover that messengers have come also to King Brand in Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathering on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move Men of his rule to assail King Brand, an
\f1 d Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in also.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
the council of elrond 315\
\'91You have done well to come,\'92 said Elrond. \'91You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But you do not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world. The Ring! What shall we do with the Ring, the least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we must deem.\
\'91That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say, though I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You have come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. Yet it is not so. Believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world.\
\'91Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand what is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present. And I will begin that tale, though others shall end it.\'92\
Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second Age of the world long ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned to Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.\
Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since that history is elsewhere recounted, even as\
\
316 the fellowship of the ring\
Elrond himself set it down in his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769  menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and Ana\u32 \u769 rion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Ar
\f0 nor, and the South- realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor.\
Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. \'91I remember well the splendour of their banners,\'92 he said. \'91It recalled to me the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.\'92\
\'91You remember?\'92 said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. \'91But I thought,\'92 he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, \'91I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.\'92\

\f1 \'91So it was indeed,\'92 answered Elrond gravely. \'91But my memory reaches back even to the Elder Days. Ea\uc0\u32 \u776 rendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of Lu\u32 \u769 thien of Doriath. I have seen t
\f0 hree ages in the West of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.\
\'91I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aeglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur\
\
the council of elrond 317\
cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father\'92s sword, and took it for his own.\'92\
At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. \'91So that is what became of the Ring!\'92 he cried. \'91If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name; but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.\'92\
\'91Alas! yes,\'92 said Elrond. \'91Isildur took it, as should not have 
\f1 been. It should have been cast then into Orodruin\'92s fire nigh at hand where it was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only C\uc0\u32 \u769 \u305 rdan stood, and I. But Isildur would not listen to
\f0  our counsel.\
\'91\'91\'91This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,\'92\'92 he said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. But soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North Isildur\'92s Bane. Yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him.\
\'91Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small wonder is it that you have not heard them, Boromir. From the ruin of the Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering. One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not yet been forged again.\
\'91Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet it did not achieve its end. Sauron was dimin- ished, but not destroyed. His Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, but its foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring, and while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men, and many of their friends, had perished in the\
\
318 the fellowship of the ring\

\f1 war. Ana\uc0\u32 \u769 rion was slain, and Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall there be any such league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that day the race of Nu\u32 \u769 menor has decayed, and the span of their years has lessened.\
\'91In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Annu\uc0\u32 \u769 minas beside Lake Evendim fell 
\f0 into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North Downs, and that now too is desolate. Men call it Deadmen\'92s Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills.\

\f1 \'91In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor, ere it fell. High towers that people built, and strong places, and 
\f0 havens of many ships; and the winged crown of the Kings of Men was held in awe by folk of many tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the midst of which the River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow; and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of the Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed of that tree before came from Eresse\uc0\u32 \u776 a, and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young.\

\f1 \'91But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of Meneldil son of Ana\uc0\u32 \u769 rion failed, and the Tree withered, and the blood of the Nu\u32 \u769  meno\u32 \u769  reans became mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept, and dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a time evil things came forth, and they took Minas It
\f0 hil and abode in it, and they made it into a place of dread; and it is\
\
the council of elrond 319\
called Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard; and these two cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked.\
\'91So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith still fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the River from Argonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in this latter day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has been found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in that I played small part.\'92\
He ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. \'91Give me leave, Master Elrond,\'92 said he, \'91first to say more of Gondor, for verily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it would be well for all to know what passes there. For few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore guess little at their peril, if we should fail at last.\

\f1 \'91Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor is spent, nor all its p
\f0 ride and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then?\
\'91Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Name- less Enemy has arisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom. The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset. When the Enemy re- turned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east of the River, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very year, in the days of June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with the Easterlings and the cruel Haradrim; but it was not by\
\
320 the fellowship of the ring\
numbers that we were defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before.\
\'91Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horse- man, a dark shadow under the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of Osgiliath.\
\'91I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down behind us. Four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and two others. But still we fight on, holding all the west shores of Anduin; and those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much praise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call.\
\'91In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But I do not seek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is said. I come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me.\
\'91In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:\
Seek for the Sword that was broken: In Imladris it dwells;\
There shall be counsels taken Stronger than Morgul-spells.\
There shall be shown a token That Doom is near at hand,\
For Isildur\'92s Bane shall waken,\
And the Halfling forth shall stand.\
\
the council of elrond 321\
Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of Gondor. This only would he say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. There- fore my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream and seek for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I took the journey upon myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which many had heard, but few knew where it lay.\'92\
\'91And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you,\'92 said Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon the table that stood before Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. \'91Here is the Sword that was Broken!\'92 he said.\
\'91And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?\'92 asked Boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger and his weather-stained cloak.\

\f1 \'91He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,\'92 said Elrond; \'91and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil\'92s son of Minas Ithil. He is the Chief of the Du\uc0\u32 \u769  nedain in the North, and few a
\f0 re now left of that folk.\'92\
\'91Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!\'92 cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring to be demanded at once.\
\'91It does not belong to either of us,\'92 said Aragorn; \'91but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while.\'92\
\'91Bring out the Ring, Frodo!\'92 said Gandalf solemnly. \'91The time has come. Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.\'92\
There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand.\
\
322 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Behold Isildur\'92s Bane!\'92 said Elrond.\
Boromir\'92s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. \'91The Halfling!\'92 he muttered. \'91Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then should we seek a broken sword?\'92\
\'91The words were not the doom of Minas Tirith,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But doom and great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur\'92s Bane, was found. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?\'92\
\'91I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a riddle,\'92 answered Boromir proudly. \'91Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope \'96 if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.\'92 He looked again at Aragorn, and doubt was in his eyes.\
Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed on his friend\'92s behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out:\
All that is gold does not glitter,\
Not all those who wander are lost;\
The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,\
A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken:\
The crownless again shall be king.\
\'91Not very good perhaps, but to the point \'96 if you need more beyond the word of Elrond. If that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear, you had best listen to it.\'92 He sat down with a snort.\
\'91I made that up myself,\'92 he whispered to Frodo, \'91for the\
\
the council of elrond 323\

\f1 Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nadan, a long time ago when he first told me about him- self. I almost wish that my adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. \'91For my part I forgive your doubt,\'92 he said. \'91Little do I resemble the figures of Elendil and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor. I am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life and a long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part in the count of my journeys. I have crossed many mountains and many rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries of Rhu\'88 n and Harad where the stars are strange.\
\'91But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations. Our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I end. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters \'96 but hunters ever of the servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor only.\
\'91If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the hou
\f1 seless hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of simple men at night, if the Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nedain were asleep, or were all gone into the grave?\

\f0 \'91And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and countrymen give us scornful names. \'91\'91Strider\'92\'92 I am to one fat man who lives within a day\'92s march of foes that would freeze his heart, or lay his little town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it otherwise.\
\
324 the fellowship of the ring\
If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred, while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown.\
\'91But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur\'92s Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. I will come to Minas Tirith.\'92\
\'91Isildur\'92s Bane is found, you say,\'92 said Boromir. \'91I have seen a bright ring in the Halfling\'92s hand; but Isildur perished ere this age of the world began, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it passed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger?\'92\
\'91That shall be told,\'92 said Elrond.\
\'91But not yet, I beg, Master!\'92 cried Bilbo. \'91Already the Sun is climbing to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.\'92\
\'91I had not named you,\'92 said Elrond smiling. \'91But I do so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.\'92\
\'91Very well,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the true story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise\'92 \'96 he looked sidelong at
\f1  Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in \'96 \'91I ask them to forget it and forgive me. I only wished to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little better now. Anyway, this is what happened.
\f0 \'92\
To some there Bilbo\'92s tale was wholly new, and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.\
\'91Well told, my friend,\'92 he said, \'91but that is enough at this time. For the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let him now speak!\'92\
\
the council of elrond 325\
Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his deal- ings with the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered, and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was examined. At last he sat down again.\
\'91Not bad,\'92 Bilbo said to him. \'91You would have made a good story of it, if they hadn\'92t kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we shall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!\'92\
\'91Yes, it made quite a long tale,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91But the story still does not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.\'92\
Galdor of the Havens, who sat nearby, overheard him. \'91You speak for me also,\'92 he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: \'91The Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling\'92s trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned in the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel \'96 if he knows the things that we have heard?\'92\
\'91The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,\'92 said Elrond. \'91I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Some, Galdor,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91would think the tidings of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling\'92s trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgu\'88l keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.\'92 At this Glo\u32 \u769 in stirred, but did not speak. \'91The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River\
\
326 the fellowship of the ring\
and the Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of the Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth.\
\'91Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our Enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood \'96 and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, if chance it was.\
\'91But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, and had long prepared against our stroke, gov- erning Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One. We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. But Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One would never again be found in Middle-earth.\
\'91 \'91\'91At the worst,\'92\'92 said he, \'91\'91our Enemy knows that we have it not, and that it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.\'92\'92 \'92\
Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden. He sighed.\
\
the council of elrond 327\
\'91There I was at fault,\'92 he said. \'91I was lulled by the words of Saruman the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would now be less.\'92\
\'91We were all at fault,\'92 said Elrond, \'91and but for your vigil- ance the Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!\'92\
\'91From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but he escaped and was not found. And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching and waiting only, as we have too often done.\
\'91Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awak- ened again to sudden fear. Whence came the hobbit\'92s ring? What, if my fear was true, should be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe.\
\'91That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear grew. I called for the help of
\f1  the Du\uc0\u32 \u769 nedain, and their watch was doubled; and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.\'92\

\f0 \'91And I,\'92 said Aragorn, \'91counselled that we should hunt for Gollum, too late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur\'92s heir should labour to repair Isildur\'92s fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.\'92\
Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. \'91There we had rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but we never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The ring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the Council came back to me: words of\
\
328 the fellowship of the ring\
Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard them now clearly in my heart.\
\'91 \'91\'91The Nine, the Seven, and the Three,\'92\'92 he said, \'91\'91had each their proper gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could still see and read.\'92\'92\
\'91What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What hand save Sauron\'92s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of Isildur alone.\
\'91With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.\
\'91 \'91\'91If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the City, read on!\'92\'92 he said. \'91\'91For to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this City.\'92\'92\
\'91So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their scripts and tongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.\'92\
\'91Some in the North, maybe,\'92 Boromir broke in. \'91All know in Gondor that he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom. In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory of his brother.\'92\
\'91But in that time also he made this scroll,\'92 said Gandalf;\
\
the council of elrond 329 \'91and that is not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For\
this scroll concerns the Ring, and thus wrote Isildur therein:\
The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim.\
\'91And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it.\
It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it. Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. It is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron\'92s hand, which was black and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. But for my part I will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.\
\'91When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of the Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes were revealed.\
\
330 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwa
\f1 rds, messages came to me out of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not guess.\'92\

\f0 \'91There is little need to tell of them,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91If a man must needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and swift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.\'92\
\'91Yes, long and weary,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91but not without profit. For one thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum\'92s ring came out of the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the Great Rings wield.\
\'91And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other\
\
the council of elrond 331\
test that I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I have done, and this I have read:\
Ash nazg durbatulu\'88k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulu\'88k agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.\'92\
The change in the wizard\'92s voice was astounding. Sud- denly it became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.\
\'91Never before has any voice dared to utter words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,\'92 said Elrond, as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more.\
\'91And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the Wise have declared: the treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great part of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed:\
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.\
\'91Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire; and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon\
\
332 the fellowship of the ring\
will know, already he may know, even as I speak, that we\
have it here.\'92\
All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. \'91He is a small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became of him? To what doom did you put him?\'92\
\'91He is in prison, but no worse,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91He had suffered much. There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Alas! alas!\'92 cried Legolas, and in his fair Elvish face there was great distress. \'91The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this company. Sme\uc0\u32 \u769 agol, who is now called 
\f0 Gollum, has escaped.\'92\
\'91Escaped?\'92 cried Aragorn. \'91That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?\'92\
\'91Not through lack of watchfulness,\'92 said Legolas; \'91but per- haps through over-kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf\'92s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old black thoughts.\'92\

\f1 \'91You were less tender to me,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in with a flash of his eyes, as old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep pla
\f0 ces of the Elven-king\'92s halls.\

\f1 \'91Now come!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Pray, do not interrupt, my good Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in. That was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all the grievances that stand between Elves and\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
the council of elrond 333\
Dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as well abandon this Council.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Glo\uc0\u32 \u769  in rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. \'91In the days of fair weather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we 
\f0 let him mount up to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at the tree\'92s foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night.\
\'91It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and star- less, that Orcs came on us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the woods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy are many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon\'92s fall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place, save where our realm is maintained.\
\'91We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those of many Orcs, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not go that way.\'92\
\'91Well, well, he is gone,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91We have no time to seek for him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.\
\'91And now I will answer Galdor\'92s other questions. What of Saruman? What are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief; but it will bear on all that we must resolve. It is the last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it has yet gone.\

\'91At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There messages reached me tell- ing me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was Radagast the Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. He is one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year.\
\'91\'91\'91Gandalf!\'92\'92 he cried. \'91\'91I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in these parts. All I knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of Shire.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Your information was correct,\'92\'92 I said. \'91\'91But do not put it that way, if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of the Shire now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a traveller, unless driven by great need.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91I have an urgent errand,\'92\'92 he said. \'91\'91My news is evil.\'92\'92 Then he looked about him, as if the hedges might have ears. \'91\'91Nazgu\'88 l,\'92\'92 he whispered. \'91\'91The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed the River secretly and are moving westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black.\'92\'92\
\'91I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it.\
\'91\'91\'91The Enemy must have some great need or purpose,\'92\'92 said Radagast; \'91\'91but what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot guess.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91What do you mean?\'92\'92 said I.\
\'91 \'91\'91I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a land called Shire.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91The Shire,\'92\'92 I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear to withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain. A great king and sorcerer\
\
the council of elrond 335\
he was of old, and now he wields a deadly fear. \'91\'91Who told you, and who sent you?\'92\'92 I asked.\
\'91 \'91\'91Saruman the White,\'92\'92 answered Radagast. \'91\'91And he told me to say that if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it will be too late.\'92\'92\
\'91And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied the arts of the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was by the devices of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine.\
\'91 \'91\'91I will go to Saruman,\'92\'92 I said.\
\'91\'91\'91Then you must go now,\'92\'92 said Radagast; \'91\'91for I have wasted time in looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you before Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once.\'92\'92 And with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off.\
\'91 \'91\'91Stay a moment!\'92\'92 I said. \'91\'91We shall need your help, and the help of all things that will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91I will do that,\'92\'92 he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after him.\
\'91I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already that day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. I stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake!\
\'91However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn;\
\
336 the fellowship of the ring\
and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the Misty Mountains, not far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But Isengard is a 
\f1 circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was not made by Saruman, but by the Men of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor long ago; and it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to 
\f0 be a work of craft. It cannot be reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is only one gate.\
\'91Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.\
\'91But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman; and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his finger.\
\'91 \'91\'91So you have come, Gandalf,\'92\'92 he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.\
\'91\'91\'91Yes, I have come,\'92\'92 I said. \'91\'91I have come for your aid, Saruman the White.\'92\'92 And that title seemed to anger him.\
\'91 \'91\'91Have you indeed, Gandalf the Grey!\'92\'92 he scoffed. \'91\'91For aid? It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.\'92\'92\
\'91I looked at him and wondered. \'91\'91But if I am not deceived,\'92\'92 said I, \'91\'91things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91That may be so,\'92\'92 he said, \'91\'91but the thought is late in coming to you. How long, I wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the Council, a matter of greatest import?\
\
the council of elrond 337\
What brings you now from your lurking-place in the Shire?\'92\'92 \'91 \'91\'91The Nine have come forth again,\'92\'92 I answered. \'91\'91They\
have crossed the River. So Radagast said to me.\'92\'92 \'91\'91\'91Radagast the Brown!\'92\'92 laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed his scorn. \'91\'91Radagast the Bird-tamer! Rada- gast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours!\'92\'92 \'91I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was\
bewildered.\
\'91 \'91\'91I liked white better,\'92\'92 I said.\
\'91\'91\'91White!\'92\'92 he sneered. \'91\'91It serves as a beginning. White\
cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91In which case it is no longer white,\'92\'92 said I. \'91\'91And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends,\'92\'92 said he. \'91\'91I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, but to give you a choice.\'92\'92\
\'91He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a speech long rehearsed. \'91\'91The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see.\
\'91 \'91\'91And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper!\'92\'92 he said, coming near and speaking now in a softer voice. \'91\'91I said we, for we it may be, if you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and po
\f1 licies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
338 the fellowship of the ring\
that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. As the Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means.\'92\'92\
\'91\'91\'91Saruman,\'92\'92 I said, \'91\'91I have heard speeches of this kind before, but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears.\'92\'92\
\'91He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. \'91\'91Well, I see that this wise course does not commend itself to you,\'92\'92 he said. \'91\'91Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived?\'92\'92\
\'91He came and laid his long hand on my arm. \'91\'91And why not, Gandalf ?\'92\'92 he whispered. \'91\'91Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then the Power would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what is your business there?\'92\'92 As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly in his eyes.\
\'91\'91\'91Saruman,\'92\'92 I said, standing away from him, \'91\'91only one hand at a time can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that I learn your mind. You were head of the Council, but you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer?\'92\'92\
\
the council of elrond 339\
\'91He was cold now and perilous. \'91\'91Yes,\'92\'92 he said. \'91\'91I did not expect you to show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is to stay here, until the end.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Until what end?\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means to persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,\'92\'92 said I. He laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it.\
\'91They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars. There is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems far away. I looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been green and fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in rivalry of Sauron and not in his service, yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my days were bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North.\
\'91That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded\
\
340 the fellowship of the ring\
on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer; and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away.\'92\
\'91I saw you!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91You were walking backwards and forwards. The moon shone in your hair.\'92\
Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. \'91It was only a dream,\'92 said Frodo, \'91but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgotten it. It came some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.\'92\
\'91Then it was late in coming,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91as you will see. I was in an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need, and do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spi- der\'92s treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.\
\'91At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Rada- gast had also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.\
\'91That was the undoing of Saruman\'92s plot. For Radagast knew no reason why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where he had many friends of old. And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard news of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me.\
\'91So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great\
\
the council of elrond 341\
Eagles, came unlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and he bore me away, before Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me.\
\'91 \'91\'91How far can you bear me?\'92\'92 I said to Gwaihir.\
\'91\'91\'91Many leagues,\'92\'92 said he, \'91\'91but not to the ends of the earth. I was sent to bear tidings not burdens.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Then I must have a steed on land,\'92\'92 I said, \'91\'91and a steed surpassingly swift, for I have never had such need of haste before.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his halls,\'92\'92 he said; \'91\'91for that is not very far off.\'92\'92 And I was glad, for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White.\
\'91 \'91\'91Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think?\'92\'92 I said to Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith.\
\'91 \'91\'91They pay a tribute of horses,\'92\'92 he answered, \'91\'91and send many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed.\'92\'92\
\'91He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose one much to my liking, but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, and I have never seen the like of him.\'92\
\'91Then he must be a noble beast indeed,\'92 said Aragorn; \'91and it grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that Sauron levies such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.\'92\
\'91Nor is it now, I will swear,\'92 said Boromir. \'91It is a lie that comes from the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan, true and\
\
342 the fellowship of the ring\
valiant, our allies, dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.\'92\
\'91The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find there, if ever you return?\'92\
\'91Not this at least,\'92 said Boromir, \'91that they will buy their lives with horses. They love their horses next to their kin. And not without reason, for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from the Shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the free days of old.\'92\
\'91True indeed!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91And there is one among them that might have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of the Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called him. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs, though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.\
\'91But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders, and though I gained on them day by day, they were ever before me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern borders, not far from the Greenway, and some invaded the Shire from the south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee. Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End.\
\'91 \'91\'91I can\'92t abide changes,\'92\'92 said he, \'91\'91not at my time of life, and least of all changes for the worst.\'92\'92 \'91\'91Changes for the worst,\'92\'92 he repeated many times.\
\'91 \'91\'91Worst is a bad word,\'92\'92 I said to him, \'91\'91and I hope you do not live to see it.\'92\'92 But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening. Then\
\
the council of elrond 343\
I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo\'92s. Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper.\
\'91\'91\'91Butterbur they call him,\'92\'92 thought I. \'91\'91If this delay was his fault, I will melt all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow fire.\'92\'92 He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot.\'92\
\'91What did you do to him?\'92 cried Frodo in alarm. \'91He was really very kind to us and did all that he could.\'92\
Gandalf laughed. \'91Don\'92t be afraid!\'92 he said. \'91I did not bite, and I barked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How it had happened I could not then guess, but I learned that you had been in Bree the night before, and had gone off that morning with Strider.\
\'91 \'91\'91Strider!\'92\'92 I cried, shouting for joy.\
\'91 \'91\'91Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,\'92\'92 said Butterbur, mistaking me. \'91\'91He got at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him. They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say.\'92\'92\
\'91 \'91\'91Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!\'92\'92 said I. \'91\'91It\'92s the best news I have had since Midsummer; it\'92s worth a gold piece at the least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years!\'92\'92 said I. \'91\'91Now I can take a night\'92s rest, the first since I have forgot- ten when.\'92\'92\
\'91So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the Riders; for only of two had there yet been any\
\
344 the fellowship of the ring\
news in Bree, it seemed. But in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up before dawn and went after them.\
\'91I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree, while two rode ahead through the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow, they returned to their Captain with tid- ings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath.\
\'91I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Bree \'96 and they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Su\'88l. I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.\
\'91At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. So I had to trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was attacked.\
\'91I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took me nearly fifteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I sent him back to his master; but a great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my\
\
the council of elrond 345\
call. But so it was that I came to Rivendell only two days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here \'96 which proved well indeed.\
\'91And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think.\
\'91Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What shall we do with it?\'92\
There was a silence. At last Elrond spoke again.\
\'91This is grievous news concerning Saruman,\'92 he said; \'91for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the westward roads.\
\'91The Barrow-wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest many tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned him to our Council.\'92\
\'91He would not have come,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\
346 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?\'92 asked Erestor. \'91It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.\'92\
\'91No, I should not put it so,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.\'92\
\'91But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,\'92 said Erestor. \'91Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?\'92\
\'91No,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91not willingly. He might do so, if all the free folk of the world begged him, but he would not under- stand the need. And if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; and that alone is answer enough.\'92\
\'91But in any case,\'92 said Glorfindel, \'91to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all else is con- quered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; and then Night will come.\'92\
\'91I know little of Iarwain save the name,\'92 said Galdor; \'91b
\f1 ut Glorfindel, I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy the very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or with C\uc0\u32 \u769 \u305 rdan at the Havens, or in Lo\u32 \u769 rien. But have they the strength, have we here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, when all else is overthrown?\'92\

\f0 \'91I have not the strength,\'92 said Elrond; \'91neither have they.\'92 \'91Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by\
\
the council of elrond 347\
strength,\'92 said Glorfindel, \'91two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the Sea, or to destroy it.\'92\
\'91But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,\'92 said Elrond. \'91And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it.\'92\
\'91Then,\'92 said Glorfindel, \'91let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the Council his feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.\'92\
\'91Not safe for ever,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age of the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope to make one.\'92\
\'91And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,\'92 said Galdor. \'91If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the Sea is now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The Nine have been unhorsed indeed, but that is but a respite, ere they find new steeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes, assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle- earth.\'92\
\'91Long yet will that march be delayed,\'92 said Boromir. \'91Gondor wanes, you say. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very strong.\'92\
\'91And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,\'92 said Galdor. \'91And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.\'92\
\
348 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Then,\'92 said Erestor, \'91there are but two courses, as Glor- findel already has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?\'92\
\'91None here can do so,\'92 said Elrond gravely. \'91At least none can foretell what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves have fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril \'96 to Mordor. We must send the Ring to the Fire.\'92\
Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his great horn and frowning. At length he spoke.\
\'91I do not understand all this,\'92 he said. \'91Saruman is a traitor, but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.\
\'91The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never sub- mit; but they may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth to victory!\'92\
\'91Alas, no,\'92 said Elrond. \'91We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise\
\
the council of elrond 349\
should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron\'92s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take the Ring to wield it.\'92\
\'91Nor I,\'92 said Gandalf.\
Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. \'91So be it,\'92 he said. \'91Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the Sword-that- was-Broken may still stem the tide \'96 if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.\'92\
\'91Who can tell?\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But we will put it to the test one day.\'92\
\'91May the day not be too long delayed,\'92 said Boromir. \'91For though I do not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought also with all the means that they have.\'92\
\'91Then be comforted,\'92 said Elrond. \'91For there are other powers and realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.\'92\
\'91St
\f1 ill it might be well for all,\'92 said Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in the Dwarf, \'91if all these strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The Seven are lost to us \'96 if Balin has not found the ring of Thro\u32 \u769 r, which was the last; naught has been heard of it since Thro\u32 \u769 r perished in Moria. Indeed I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin went away.\'92\

\f0 \'91Balin will find no ring in Moria,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Thro 
\f1 \uc0\u769 r gave it to Thra\u32 \u769 in his son, but not Thra\u32 \u769 in to Thorin. It was taken with torment from Thra\u32 \u769 in in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.\'92\

\f1 \cf0 \'91Ah, alas!\'92 cried Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in. \'91When will the day come of our revenge? But stil
\f0 l there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not say?\'92\
The Elves returned no ans
\f1 wer. \'91Did you not hear me, Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in?\'92 said Elrond. \'91The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this hour of doubt I may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapo
\f0 ns of war or conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing, and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.\'92\

\f1 \'91But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed, as you counsel?\'92 asked Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91We know not for certain,\'92 answered Elrond sadly. \'91Some hope that the Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.\'92\
\'91Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,\'92 said Glorfindel, \'91if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever.\'92\
\'91Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,\'92 said Erestor, \'91and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.\'92\
\'91Despair, or folly?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is not despair, for\
\
the council of elrond 351\
despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.\'92\
\'91At least for a while,\'92 said Elrond. \'91The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.\'92\
\'91Very well, very well, Master Elrond!\'92 said Bilbo suddenly. \'91Say no more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful nuisance. When ought I to start?\'92\
Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others re
\f1 garded the old hobbit with grave respect. Only Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in smiled, but his smile came from old memories.\

\f0 \'91Of course, my dear Bilbo,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91If you had really started this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you\
\
352 the fellowship of the ring\
know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when they come back.\'92\
Bilbo laughed. \'91I have never known you give me pleasant advice before,\'92 he said. \'91As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don\'92t suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do you mean by they?\'92\
\'91The messengers who are sent with the Ring.\'92\
\'91Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon. Can\'92t we think of some names now? Or put it off till after dinner?\'92\
No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelm- ing longing to rest and remain at peace by Bilbo\'92s side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.\
\'91I will take the Ring,\'92 he said, \'91though I do not know the way.\'92\
***\
\
the council of elrond 353\
Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. \'91If I understand aright all that I have heard,\'92 he said, \'91I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has struck?\
\'91But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your choice 
\f1 is right; and though all the mighty Elf-friends of old, Hador, and Hu\uc0\u32 \u769 rin, and Tu\u32 \u769 rin, and Beren himself were assembled together, your seat should be among them.\'92\

\f0 \'91But you won\'92t send him off alone surely, Master?\'92 cried Sam, unable to contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor.\
\'91No indeed!\'92 said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. \'91You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.\'92\
Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. \'91A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!\'92 he said, shaking his head.\
\
Chapter 3\
THE RING GOES SOUTH\
Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo\'92s room. Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo\'92s companion.\
\'91It\'92s most unfair,\'92 said Pippin. \'91Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!\'92\
\'91Rewards!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I can\'92t imagine a more severe pun- ishment. You are not thinking what you are saying: con- demned to go on this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.\'92\
\'91I don\'92t wonder,\'92 said Merry, \'91and I wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times. We want to go on.\'92\
\'91That\'92s what I meant,\'92 said Pippin. \'91We hobbits ought to stick together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence in the party.\'92\
\'91Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!\'92 said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground. \'91But you are all worrying yourselves unnecess- arily. Nothing is decided yet.\'92\
\'91Nothing decided!\'92 cried Pippin. \'91Then what were you all doing? You were shut up for hours.\'92\
\'91Talking,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91There was a deal of talk, and every- one had an eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas\'92s bit of news about Gollum caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.\'92\
\
the ring goes south 355\
\'91You were wrong,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You were inattentive. I had already heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not surprised.\'92\
\'91Well, anyway,\'92 said Bilbo, \'91nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said the wizard. \'91Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil\'92s folk in Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond\'92s sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably make quite a long stay here.\'92\
\'91Ah!\'92 said Sam gloomily. \'91We\'92ll just wait long enough for winter to come.\'92\
\'91That can\'92t be helped,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91It\'92s your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I can\'92t help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s into Bag End. But there it is: you can\'92t wait now till spring; and you can\'92t go till the reports come back.\
When winter first begins to bite\
and stones crack in the frosty night,\
when pools are black and trees are bare, \'92tis evil in the Wild to fare.\
But that I am afraid will be just your luck.\'92\
\'91I am afraid it will,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91We can\'92t start until we\
have found out about the Riders.\'92\
\'91I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,\'92 said Merry. \'91You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91The power of their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked,\
\
356 the fellowship of the ring\
and so made for a while less dangerous; but we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.\'92\
So great was Frodo\'92s delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. \'91I only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me, I want to see Elrond. I must be off.\'92\
\'91How long do you think I shall have here?\'92 said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.\
\'91Oh, I don\'92t know. I can\'92t count days in Rivendell,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91But quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping me with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an ending?\'92\
\'91Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Oh, that won\'92t do!\'92 said Bilbo. \'91Books ought to have good endings. How would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after?\'92\
\'91It will do well, if it ever comes to that,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Ah!\'92 said Sam. \'91And where will they live? That\'92s what I often wonder.\'92\
For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word and song.\
So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale\

silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east. The Hunter\'92s Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the heavens, burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.\
The hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of Elrond, and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the sources of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass that was called the Redhorn Gate. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to any save to Elrond.\
In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and tattered. Of\
\

the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North.\
\'91Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.\
\'91If that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no longer.\'92\
Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. \'91The time has come,\'92 he said. \'91If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?\'92\
\'91I do,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I will go with Sam.\'92\
\'91Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,\'92 said Elrond. \'91I can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders of the Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well mis- carry, or come no quicker than you yourself.\
\'91And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed and secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the power of Mordor.\

\'91The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours.\
\'91For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the 
\f1 Elves; and Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.\'92\

\f0 \'91Strider!\'92 cried Frodo.\
\'91Yes,\'92 he said with a smile. \'91I ask leave once again to be your companion, Frodo.\'92\
\'91I would have begged you to come,\'92 said Frodo, \'91only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.\'92\
\'91I am,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be re-forged ere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie together for many hundreds of miles. There- fore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a valiant man.\'92\
\'91There remain two more to be found,\'92 said Elrond. \'91These I will consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.\'92\
\'91But that will leave no place for us!\'92 cried Pippin in dismay. \'91We don\'92t want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.\'92 \'91That is because you do not understand and cannot\
imagine what lies ahead,\'92 said Elrond.\
\'91Neither does Frodo,\'92 said Gandalf, unexpectedly support-\
ing Pippin. \'91Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an Elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power that is in him.\'92\
\'91You speak gravely,\'92 said Elrond, \'91but I am in doubt. The\
\
360 the fellowship of the ring\
Shire, I forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that the younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against his going.\'92\
\'91Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me home tied in a sack,\'92 said Pippin. \'91For otherwise I shall follow the Company.\'92\
\'91Let it be so then. You shall go,\'92 said Elrond, and he sighed. \'91Now the tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.\'92\
The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in 
\f1 it, and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andu\uc0\u32 \u769 ril, Flame of the West.\

\f0 Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.\
In those last days the hobbits sat toge
\f1 ther in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren and Lu\uc0\u32 \u769 thien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bi
\f0 lbo in his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes of Frodo\'92s adventures.\
On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo,\
\
the ring goes south 361\
and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and fumbled inside.\
\'91Here is your sword,\'92 he said. \'91But it was broken, you know. I took it to keep it safe but I\'92ve forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No time now. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don\'92t you know?\'92\
He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold and bright. \'91This is Sting,\'92 he said, and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam. \'91Take it, if you like. I shan\'92t want it again, I expect.\'92\
Frodo accepted it gratefully.\
\'91Also there is this!\'92 said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit silver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and crystal.\
\'91It\'92s a pretty thing, isn\'92t it?\'92 said Bilbo, moving it in the light. \'91And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got it back from Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage. I brought all the mementoes of my Jour- ney away with me, except the Ring. But I did not expect to use this, and I don\'92t need it now, except to look at sometimes. You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.\'92\
\'91I should look \'96 well, I don\'92t think I should look right in it,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Just what I said myself,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91But never mind about looks. You can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret with me. Don\'92t tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black Riders,\'92 he ended in a low voice.\
\'91Very well, I will take it,\'92 said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo\
\
362 the fellowship of the ring\
put over the top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket.\
\'91Just a plain hobbit you look,\'92 said Bilbo. \'91But there is more about you now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!\'92 He turned away and looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune.\
\'91I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all your past kindnesses,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Don\'92t try!\'92 said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the back. \'91Ow!\'92 he cried. \'91You are too hard now to slap! But there you are: Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return is: take as much care of yourself as you can, and bring back all the news you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. I\'92ll do my best to finish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if I am spared.\'92 He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly.\
I sit beside the fire and think of all that I have seen,\
of meadow-flowers and butterflies in summers that have been;\
Of yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that there were,\
with morning mist and silver sun and wind upon my hair.\
I sit beside the fire and think of how the world will be\
when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see.\
For still there are so many things that I have never seen:\
in every wood in every spring there is a different green.\
\
the ring goes south 363\
I sit beside the fire and think of people long ago,\
and people who will see a world that I shall never know.\
But all the while I sit and think of times there were before,\
I listen for returning feet and voices at the door.\
It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.\
\'91You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,\'92 he said. \'91I do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had Andu\uc0\u32 \u769 ril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a long sword, in fashion like Andu\u32 \u769  ril but of less lineage, and he bore also a shield and his war-horn.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,\'92 he said, \'91and then let all the foes of Gondor flee!\'92 Putting it to his lips he blew a blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang to their feet.\
\'91Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir,\'92\
\
364 the fellowship of the ring\
said Elrond, \'91until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on you.\'92\
\'91Maybe,\'92 said Boromir. \'91But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth as a thief in the night.\'92\
Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel- rings, for dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely Mountain.\
All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they had brought from Bree.\
The stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, if he did not come.\
\'91That animal can nearly talk,\'92 he said, \'91and would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: if you don\'92t let me go with you, Sam, I\'92ll follow on my own.\'92 So Bill was going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that did not seem depressed.\
Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the door- step beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him.\
\
the ring goes south 365\
The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness. Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily\
below; his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.\
\'91Bill, my lad,\'92 he said, \'91you oughtn\'92t to have took up with us. You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the\
new grass comes.\'92 Bill swished his tail and said nothing. Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I\'92ll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose; linen; various small belongings of his master\'92s that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for. He\
went through them all.\
\'91Rope!\'92 he muttered. \'91No rope! And only last night you\
said to yourself: \'91\'91Sam, what about a bit of rope? You\'92ll want it, if you haven\'92t got it.\'92\'92 Well, I\'92ll want it. I can\'92t get it now.\'92\
At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him. \'91This is my last word,\'92 he said in a low voice. \'91The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid: neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the Council, and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.\'92\
\'91Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,\'92 said Gimli.\
\
366 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Maybe,\'92 said Elrond, \'91but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.\'92\
\'91Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91Or break it,\'92 said Elrond. \'91Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!\'92\
\'91Good ... good luck!\'92 cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. \'91I don\'92t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don\'92t be too long! Farewell!\'92\
Many others of Elrond\'92s household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk.\
They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far into the night.\
At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.\
Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard.\
\
the ring goes south 367\
The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.\
At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping for- ward like snails, and getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.\
They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly- trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun.\
Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with\
\
368 the fellowship of the ring\
snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red.\
Gandalf stood at Frodo\'92s side and looked out under his hand. \'91We have done well,\'92 he said. \'91We have reached the borders of the country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its name. Five-and- forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.\'92\
\'91Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,\'92 said Frodo, throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face.\
\'91But the mountains are ahead of us,\'92 said Pippin. \'91We must have turned eastwards in the night.\'92\
\'91No,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But you see further ahead in the clear light. Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps in Elrond\'92s house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?\'92\
\'91Yes I did, sometimes,\'92 said Pippin, \'91but I don\'92t remember them. Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing.\'92\
\'91I need no map,\'92 said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. \'91There is the land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathu\'88 r.\
\'91Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-du\'88m, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil and Bundushathu\'88r.\
\'91There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their\
\
the ring goes south 369\
arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot for- get: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.\'92\
\'91It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91If we climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in its icy springs.\'92\
\'91Dark is the water of Kheled-za\'88ram,\'92 said Gimli, \'91and cold are the springs of Kibil-na\'88la. My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them soon.\'92\
\'91May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then\'97\'97\'92\
He paused.\
\'91Yes, and where then?\'92 asked Merry.\
\'91To the end of the journey \'96 in the end,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91We\
cannot look too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.\'92\
\'91That is true,\'92 said Legolas. \'91But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember them. Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. They are gone. They sought the Havens long ago.\'92\
That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly, and their supper-breakfast was merrier than it had been since they set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless.\
\
370 the fellowship of the ring\
After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the others laughing and talking.\
\'91What is the matter, Strider?\'92 Merry called up. \'91What are you looking for? Do you miss the East Wind?\'92\
\'91No indeed,\'92 he answered. \'91But I miss something. I have been in the country of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.\'92\
Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. \'91But what do you guess is the reason?\'92 he asked. \'91Is there more in it than sur- prise at seeing four hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or heard?\'92\
\'91I hope that is it,\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.\'92 \'91Then we must be more careful,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is Aragorn. We must stop talking\
aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.\'92\
It was Sam\'92s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it. The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the pony\'92s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like flying smoke in the wind.\
\'91What\'92s that, Strider? It don\'92t look like a cloud,\'92 said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; but before long Sam could see for himself\
\
the ring goes south 371\
what was approaching. Flocks of birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily drawing nearer.\
\'91Lie flat and still!\'92 hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one harsh croak was heard.\
Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and wakened Gandalf.\
\'91Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the Greyflood,\'92 he said, \'91and they have passed over Hollin. They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move again this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being watched.\'92\
\'91And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,\'92 said Gandalf; \'91and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you are right.\'92\
\'91Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the crebain came,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91It must be put out and not lit again.\'92\
\'91Well if that isn\'92t a plague and a nuisance!\'92 said Pippin. The news: no fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke in the late afternoon. \'91All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight: something hot.\'92\
\'91Well, you can go on looking forward,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\
372 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.\'92\
\'91Too warm, I shouldn\'92t wonder,\'92 muttered Sam to Frodo. \'91But I\'92m beginning to think it\'92s time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain, and saw the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!\'92 Maps conveyed nothing to Sam\'92s mind, and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning.\
All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded.\
Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black. Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land.\
It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again. He shivered.\
\'91Did you see anything pass over?\'92 he whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead.\
\'91No, but I felt it, whatever it was,\'92 he answered. \'91It may be nothing, only a wisp of thin cloud.\'92\
\'91It was moving fast then,\'92 muttered Aragorn, \'91and not with the wind.\'92\
***\
\

Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morn- ing Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.\
There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back.\
\'91Winter deepens behind us,\'92 he said quietly to Aragorn. \'91The heights away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate. We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think of your course now, Aragorn?\'92\
Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened anxiously.\
\'91I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91And perils known and unknown will grow as we go on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the moun- tains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows which side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?\'92\
\'91Who knows indeed!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there is another way, and not by the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.\'92\
\'91But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others, I beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.\'92\
\'91We must decide before we go further,\'92 answered Gandalf.\
\
374 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the\
others rest and sleep,\'92 said Aragorn.\
In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned.\
\'91From signs that we have seen lately,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we can. Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can get ready.\'92\
\'91I will add a word of advice, if I may,\'92 said Boromir. \'91I was born under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys in the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.\'92\
\'91And Bill could take a bit more, couldn\'92t you, lad?\'92 said Sam. The pony looked at him mournfully.\
\'91Very well,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But we must not use the wood \'96 not unless it is a choice between fire and death.\'92\
The Company set out again, with good speed at first; but soon their way became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared,\
\
the ring goes south 375\
and was blocked with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.\
Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.\
They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and swirling into Frodo\'92s eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.\
\'91I don\'92t like this at all,\'92 panted Sam just behind. \'91Snow\'92s all right on a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it\'92s falling. I wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.\'92 Except on the high moors of the North- farthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 1311, when white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine.\
Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was already ankle-deep about his boots.\
\'91This is what I feared,\'92 he said. \'91What do you say now, Aragorn?\'92\
\'91That I feared it too,\'92 Aragorn answered, \'91but less than other things. I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where the paths are usually open all the winter.\'92\
\'91I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,\'92 said Boromir. \'91They say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.\'92\
\
376 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91His arm has grown long indeed,\'92 said Gimli, \'91if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.\'92\
\'91His arm has grown long,\'92 said Gandalf.\
While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow continued. Frodo\'92s feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.\
The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, whist- ling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above.\
\'91We cannot go further tonight,\'92 said Boromir. \'91Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed at us.\'92\
\'91I do call it the wind,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But that does not make what you say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with Sauron, but have purposes of their own. Some have been in this world longer than he.\'92\
\'91Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name,\'92 said Gimli, \'91long years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.\'92\
\
the ring goes south 377\
\'91It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack,\'92 said Gandalf.\
\'91But what can we do?\'92 cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry and Frodo, and he was shivering.\
\'91Either stop where we are, or go back,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is no good going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones \'96 or anything else.\'92\
\'91And it is no good going back while the storm holds,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91We have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now.\'92\
\'91Shelter!\'92 muttered Sam. \'91If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.\'92\
The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.\
They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.\
A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo\'92s voice speaking. I don\'92t think much of your diary, he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!\
But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came back pain- fully to wakefulness. Boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow.\
\
378 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,\'92 said Boromir. \'91It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do something to save ourselves.\'92\
\'91Give them this,\'92 said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask. \'91Just a mouthful each \'96 for all of us. It is very precious. It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!\'92\
As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew louder.\
\'91What do you say to fire?\'92 asked Boromir suddenly. \'91The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help us.\'92\
\'91You may make a fire, if you can,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.\'92\
But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.\
\'91If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,\'92 he said. \'91I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.\'92\
But the Company cared no longer for watchers or un- friendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they\
\
the ring goes south 379\
stood, stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blow- ing flames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a black wall.\
But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.\
The fire burned low, and the last faggot was thrown on.\
\'91The night is getting old,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91The dawn is not far off.\'92\
\'91If any dawn can pierce these clouds,\'92 said Gimli.\
Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. \'91The snow is growing less,\'92 he said, \'91and the wind is quieter.\'92\
Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slacken- ing. Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim light began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether.\
As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.\
Gimli looked up and shook his head. \'91Caradhras has not forgiven us,\'92 he said. \'91He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go back and down the better.\'92\
To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.\
\'91If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,\'92 said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart.\
\'91If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun\
\
380 the fellowship of the ring\
to save us,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.\'92\
\'91Well,\'92 said Boromir, \'91when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than a furlong off, I guess.\'92\
\'91Then let us force a path thither, you and I!\'92 said Aragorn.\
Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.\
Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to the others. \'91The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf, or over snow \'96 an Elf.\'92\
With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.\
\'91Farewell!\'92 he said to Gandalf. \'91I go to find the Sun!\'92 Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky turn.\
The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again.\
An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer,\
\
the ring goes south 381\
and then at last they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope.\
\'91Well,\'92 cried Legolas as he ran up, \'91I have not brought the Sun. She is walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit\'92s toes.\'92\
\'91Ah, it is as I said,\'92 growled Gimli. \'91It was no ordinary storm. It is the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that drift was laid to cut off our escape.\'92\
\'91But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,\'92 said Boromir, who came up at that moment. \'91And doughty Men too, if I may say it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.\'92\
\'91But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the drift?\'92 said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.\
\'91Have hope!\'92 said Boromir. \'91I am weary, but I still have some strength left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will begin with you.\'92\
He lifted up the hobbit. \'91Cling to my back! I shall need my arms,\'92 he said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went.\
They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across\
\
382 the fellowship of the ring\
the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive.\
After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them.\
\'91Enough, enough!\'92 cried Gimli. \'91We are departing as quickly as we may!\'92 And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew broader.\
As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before.\
The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass.\
Frodo\'92s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were circling in the air.\
\'91The birds again!\'92 said Aragorn, pointing down.\
\
the ring goes south 383\
\'91That cannot be helped now,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Whether they are good or evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!\'92\
A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated them.\
\
Chapter 4\
A JOURNEY IN THE DARK\
It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a council.\
\'91We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,\'92 he said. \'91The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.\'92\
\'91And then where are we to go?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91We still have our journey and our errand before us,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.\'92\
Pippin\'92s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.\
\'91I wish I was back there,\'92 he said. \'91But how can I return without shame \'96 unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated?\'92\
\'91You are right, Frodo,\'92 said Gandalf: \'91to go back is to admit defeat, and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master\'92s hand again.\'92\
\'91Then we must go on, if there is a way,\'92 said Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back into gloom.\
\'91There is a way that we may attempt,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I\
\
a journey in the dark 385\
thought from the beginning, when first I considered this jour- ney, that we should try it. But it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried.\'92\
\'91If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil indeed,\'92 said Merry. \'91But you had better tell us about it, and let us know the worst at once.\'92\
\'91The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,\'92 said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear.\
\'91The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead through Moria?\'92 said Aragorn darkly.\
\'91It is a name of ill omen,\'92 said Boromir. \'91Nor do I see the need to go there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh to the sea.\'92\
\'91Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer.\
\'91As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you were in the Enemy\'92s eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return now as a member of the Ring\'92s Company, and you are in peril as\
\
386 the fellowship of the ring\
long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky.\
\'91Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.\'92\
\'91We do not know what he expects,\'92 said Boromir. \'91He may watch all roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower itself. The name of Moria is black.\'92\
\'91You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91I alone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-du\'88r do not return. But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; but there is a hope that Moria is still free.\
\'91There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove, one must tread the path that need chooses!\'92\
\'91I will tread the path with you, Gandalf !\'92 said Gimli. \'91I will go and look on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there \'96 if you can find the doors that are shut.\'92\
\'91Good, Gimli!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91You encourage me. We will seek the hidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the Dwarves, a dwarf \'92s head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time that I have been to Moria. I sought there long\

tion is: who will follow me, if I lead you there?\'92\
\'91I will,\'92 said Gimli eagerly.\
\'91I will,\'92 said Aragorn heavily. \'91You followed my lead almost\
to disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your lead now \'96 if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware!\'92\
\'91I will not go,\'92 said Boromir; \'91not unless the vote of the whole Company is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The Ring-bearer\'92s voice surely should be heard?\'92\
\'91I do not wish to go to Moria,\'92 said Legolas.\
The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. \'91I do not wish to go,\'92 he said; \'91but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom. How the wind howls!\'92\
At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round them in the empty spaces of the night.\
Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. \'91How the wind howls!\'92 he cried. \'91It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains!\'92\
\'91Need we wait until morning then?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91It is as I said. The hunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who\
\
388 the fellowship of the ring\
now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail?\'92\
\'91How far is Moria?\'92 asked Boromir.\
\'91There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,\'92 answered Gandalf grimly.\
\'91Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,\'92 said Boromir. \'91The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.\'92\
\'91True!\'92 said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. \'91But where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls.\'92\
\'91I wish I had taken Elrond\'92s advice,\'92 muttered Pippin to Sam. \'91I am no good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don\'92t ever remember feeling so wretched.\'92\
\'91My heart\'92s right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,\'92 said Sam. \'91But we aren\'92t etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I\'92ll wager it isn\'92t a wolf\'92s belly.\'92\
For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering. It was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder-stones. In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.\
Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off. In the dead of night many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault.\
\
a journey in the dark 389\
Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. \'91Listen, Hound of Sauron!\'92 he cried. \'91Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.\'92\
The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the Elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on the sighing wind.\
The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds. Sud- denly Frodo started from sleep. Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once.\
\'91Fling fuel on the fire!\'92 cried Gandalf to the hobbits. \'91Draw your blades, and stand back to back!\'92\
In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was singing.\
In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and his voice rolled like thunder.\
\'91Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!\'92 he cried. There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him\
\
390 the fellowship of the ring\
burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled.\
Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were routed and did not return.\
\'91What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin?\'92 said Sam, sheathing his sword. \'91Wolves won\'92t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed the hair off my head!\'92\
When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left.\
\'91It is as I feared,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!\'92\
That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they stood upon the hillside, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain-tops.\
\'91We must reach the doors before sunset,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91or I fear we shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has\
\
a journey in the dark 391\
seldom walked in this country, and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago.\
\'91There it lies,\'92 he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the mountains\'92 sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than the rest, one great grey wall. \'91When we left the pass I led you southwards, and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is well that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste is needed. Let us go!\'92\
\'91I do not know which to hope,\'92 said Boromir grimly: \'91that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest chance. Lead on!\'92\
Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard\'92s side, so eager was he to come to Moria. Together they led the Company back towards the mountains. The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.\
The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Com- pany wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts sank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared to think.\
Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow chan- nel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed;\
\
392 the fellowship of the ring\
but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad.\
\'91Ah! Here it is at last!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We are late.\'92\
The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks.\
At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full.\
\'91Indeed things have changed!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there is no mistaking the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level ground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now!\'92\
They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled\
\
a journey in the dark 393\
the cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone.\
\'91There are the Walls of Moria,\'92 said Gandalf, pointing across the water. \'91And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day. It has an unwholesome look.\'92\
\'91We must find a way round the northern edge,\'92 said Gimli. \'91The first thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our baggage-pony up this stair.\'92\
\'91But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.\'92\
\'91Poor old Bill!\'92 said Frodo. \'91I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will say?\'92\
\'91I am sorry,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Poor Bill has been a useful companion, and it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.\'92\
The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could, climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley\
\
394 the fellowship of the ring\
and the water\'92s edge there was a rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.\
When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclos- ing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean water on his feet.\
As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bub- bling noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.\
Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows\
\
a journey in the dark 395\
about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.\
\'91Well, here we are at last!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Here the Elven- way from Hollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West-door was made chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.\'92\
\'91It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,\'92 said Legolas.\
\'91I have heard both,\'92 said Gandalf; \'91and I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find them the better. Night is at hand!\'92\
Turning to the others he said: \'91While I am searching, will you each make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the water-skins.\'92\
\'91But you can\'92t leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf!\'92 cried Sam, angry and distressed. \'91I won\'92t have it, and that\'92s flat. After he has come so far and all!\'92\
\'91I am sorry, Sam,\'92 said the wizard. \'91But when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.\'92\
\'91He\'92d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon\'92s den, if I led him,\'92 protested Sam. \'91It\'92d be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about.\'92\
\
396 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91It will be short of murder, I hope,\'92 said Gandalf. He laid his hand on the pony\'92s head, and spoke in a low voice. \'91Go with words of guard and guiding on you,\'92 he said. \'91You are a wise beast, and have learned much in Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in time to Elrond\'92s house, or wherever you wish to go.\
\'91There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escap- ing wolves and getting home as we have.\'92\
Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to Sam\'92s ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all the pony\'92s packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted out the goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the rest.\
When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was pressed against the rock, as if listening.\
\'91Well, here we are and all ready,\'92 said Merry; \'91but where are the Doors? I can\'92t see any sign of them.\'92\
\'91Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,\'92 said Gimli. \'91They are invisible, and their own makers cannot find them or open them, if their secret is forgotten.\'92\
\'91But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,\'92 said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. \'91Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.\'92\
He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.\
\'91Look!\'92 he said. \'91Can you see anything now?\'92\
The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the\
\
a journey in the dark 397\
surface, where the wizard\'92s hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed.\
At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the door a single star with many rays.\
\'91There are the emblems of Durin!\'92 cried Gimli.\
\'91And there is the Tree of the High Elves!\'92 said Legolas. \'91And the Star of the House of Fe\uc0\u32 \u776 anor,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91They\
are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moon- light, and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my mind.\'92\
\'91What does the writing say?\'92 asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch. \'91I thought I knew the elf-letters, but I cannot read these.\'92\
\'91The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle- earth in the Elder Days,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91But they do not say anything of importance to us. They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.\'92\
\'91What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?\'92 asked Merry.\
\'91That is plain enough,\'92 said Gimli. \'91If you are a friend, speak the password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91these doors are probably governed by words. Some dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or\
\
398 the fellowship of the ring\
 \
a journey in the dark 399\
for particular persons; and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not, Gimli?\'92\
\'91It is,\'92 said the dwarf. \'91But what the word was is not remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.\'92\
\'91But do not you know the word, Gandalf ?\'92 asked Boromir in surprise.\
\'91No!\'92 said the wizard.\
The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and unmoved.\
\'91Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?\'92 cried Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. \'91You told us that you had once passed through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not know how to enter?\'92\
\'91The answer to your first question, Boromir,\'92 said the wiz- ard, \'91is that I do not know the word \'96 yet. But we shall soon see. And,\'92 he added, with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, \'91you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came from the East.\
\'91If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside nothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced inwards.\'92\
\'91What are you going to do then?\'92 asked Pippin, undaunted by the wizard\'92s bristling brows.\
\'91Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will seek for the opening words.\
\'91I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men\
\
400 the fellowship of the ring\
or Orcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that seems certain.\'92\
He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil.\
Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!\
he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank grey stone did not stir.\
Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech. Nothing hap- pened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.\
Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of Middle- earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in silence.\
At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him.\
\'91Do not let him run away!\'92 said Boromir. \'91It seems that we shall need him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool!\'92 He stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water.\
The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant\
\
a journey in the dark 401\
there was a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff.\
\'91Why did you do that, Boromir?\'92 said Frodo. \'91I hate this place, too, and I am afraid. I don\'92t know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don\'92t disturb it!\'92\
\'91I wish we could get away!\'92 said Merry.\
\'91Why doesn\'92t Gandalf do something quick?\'92 said Pippin. Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head\
bowed, either in despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard again. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already lapping on the shore.\
With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. He was laughing! \'91I have it!\'92 he cried. \'91Of course, of course! Absurdly simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.\'92\
Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice: Mellon!\
The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before. Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder.\
\'91I was wrong after all,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and Gimli too. Merry, of all people, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say \'91\'91Friend\'92\'92 and enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier times. Now let us go!\'92\
He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that moment several things happened. Frodo felt\
\
402 the fellowship of the ring\
something seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after him, and then hearing Frodo\'92s cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing. The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern end.\
Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo\'92s foot, and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.\
The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. Twenty other arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a hideous stench.\
\'91Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick!\'92 shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to the ground where they stood, he drove them forward.\
They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fin- gered the cliff-wall and the doors. One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone.\
Sam, clinging to Frodo\'92s arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness. \'91Poor old Bill!\'92 he said in a choking voice. \'91Poor old Bill! Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.\'92\
They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, but the doors did not open.\
***\
\
a journey in the dark 403\
\'91Well, well!\'92 said the wizard. \'91The passage is blocked behind us now, and there is only one way out \'96 on the other side of the mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so long.\'92\
\'91I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,\'92 said Frodo. \'91What was the thing, or were there many of them?\'92\
\'91I do not know,\'92 answered Gandalf; \'91but the arms were all guided by one purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.\'92 He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.\
Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: \'91In the deep places of the world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark?\'92\
\'91I will,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!\'92\
As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into the dark.\
\'91Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can\'92t find a dining-room!\'92 said Frodo. He had begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.\
The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.\

\'91It will not last much longer, I am afraid,\'92 he said; \'91but I think we need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.\'92\
\'91How long is that going to take us?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91I cannot say,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91It depends on many chances. But going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.\'92\
After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked Aragorn.\
The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard\'92s staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches, and of other\
\
a journey in the dark 405\
passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.\
Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtfu
\f1 l; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in\'92s son, dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of l
\f0 ittle help, but even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.\
\'91Do not be afraid!\'92 said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. \'91Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales in Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I hav
\f1 e seen. He will not go astray \'96 if there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Beru\uc0\u32 \u769 thiel.\'92\

\f0 It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over\
\
406 the fellowship of the ring\
the dreadful gap. The noise of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the depths.\
\'91Rope!\'92 muttered Sam. \'91I knew I\'92d want it, if I hadn\'92t got it!\'92\
As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains\'92 roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo\'92s spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife- stroke, that grim wound had not been without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his com- panions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.\
The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. There was no sound but the sound of their own feet: the dull stump of Gimli\'92s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce- heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.\
***\
\
a journey in the dark 407\
It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand pass- age plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.\
\'91I have no memory of this place at all!\'92 said Gandalf, stand- ing uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to be seen. \'91I am too weary to decide,\'92 he said, shaking his head. \'91And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has passed.\'92\
\'91Poor old Bill!\'92 said Sam. \'91I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven\'92t got him yet.\'92\
To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.\
\'91Steady! Steady!\'92 cried Gandalf, as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the open passage. \'91Steady! You do not know what is inside yet. I will go first.\'92\
He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. \'91There!\'92 he said, pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near.\
\'91One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom,\'92 said Aragorn to Merry. \'91Let the guide go first while you have one.\'92\
\'91This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the three passages,\'92 said Gimli. \'91That hole was plainly a well for the guards\'92 use, covered with a stone lid.\
\
408 the fellowship of the ring\
But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the dark.\'92 Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there came a plunk, very distant, but magni-\
fied and repeated in the hollow shaft.\
\'91What\'92s that?\'92 cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin\
confessed what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting. \'91Fool of a Took!\'92 he growled. \'91This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuis- ance. Now be quiet!\'92\
Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again.\
\'91That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do with Peregrin\'92s foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a reward,\'92 he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.\
Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.\
\
a journey in the dark 409\
Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin.\
\'91Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,\'92 he said in a kindly tone. \'91You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the watching.\'92\
\'91I know what is the matter with me,\'92 he muttered, as he sat down by the door. \'91I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm.\'92\
The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose, and the puff of smoke.\
It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. \'91And in the watches I have made up my mind,\'92 he said. \'91I do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up again.\'92\
For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard\'92s light, bobbing like a will-o\'92-the-wisp in front of them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march.\
In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in\
\
410 the fellowship of the ring\
a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the road climbed upwards, Frodo\'92s spirits rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following foot- step that was not an echo.\
They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left van- ished. They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They halted and crowded anxiously together.\
Gandalf seemed pleased. \'91I chose the right way,\'92 he said. \'91At last we are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real light.\'92\
He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side. Then the light went out.\
\'91That is all that I shall venture on for the present,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91There used to be great windows on the mountain- side, and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile we had better go no further. Let\
\
a journey in the dark 411\
us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world.\'92\
The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung the dark- ness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.\
\'91There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time,\'92 said Sam; \'91and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They didn\'92t live in these darksome holes surely?\'92\
\'91These are not holes,\'92 said Gimli. \'91This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.\'92\
He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof.\
The world was young, the mountains green, No stain yet on the Moon was seen,\
No words were laid on stream or stone When Durin woke and walked alone.\
He named the nameless hills and dells; He drank from yet untasted wells;\
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, And saw a crown of stars appear,\
As gems upon a silver thread, Above the shadow of his head.\
\
412\
the fellowship of the ring\
The world was fair, the mountains tall, In Elder Days before the fall\
Of mighty kings in Nargothrond\
And Gondolin, who now beyond\
The Western Seas have passed away: The world was fair in Durin\'92s Day.\
A king he was on carven throne\
In many-pillared halls of stone\
With golden roof and silver floor, And runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon In shining lamps of crystal hewn Undimmed by cloud or shade of night There shone for ever fair and bright.\
There hammer on the anvil smote,\
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;\
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; The delver mined, the mason built.\
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,\
And metal wrought like fishes\'92 mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,\
And shining spears were laid in hoard.\
Unwearied then were Durin\'92s folk; Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, And at the gates the trumpets rang.\
The world is grey, the mountains old, The forge\'92s fire is ashen-cold;\
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: The darkness dwells in Durin\'92s halls; The shadow lies upon his tomb\
In Moria, in Khazad-du\'88m.\
But still the sunken stars appear\
\
a journey in the dark 413\
In dark and windless Mirrormere; There lies his crown in water deep, Till Durin wakes again from sleep.\
\'91I like that!\'92 said Sam. \'91I should like to learn it. In Moria, in Khazad-du\'88m! But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still?\'92\
Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.\
\'91Piles of jewels?\'92 said Gandalf. \'91No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they are drowned in water \'96 or in a shadow of fear.\'92\
\'91Then what do the dwarves want to come back for?\'92 asked Sam.\
\'91For mithril,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; for little is left above ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Durin\'92s Bane. Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets it.\
\'91Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty\
\
414 the fellowship of the ring\
was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.\'92\
\'91What?\'92 cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. \'91A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.\'92\
Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, or mithril \'96 or the Ring.\
A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall.\
His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. \'91I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard,\'92 he thought. \'91I was on the edge of a dream.\'92 He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas.\
\
a journey in the dark 415\
When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly.\
Frodo sat up. \'91Good morning!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91For morning it is again at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.\'92\
\'91I shall be glad,\'92 said Gimli. \'91I have looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.\'92\
After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. \'91We are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,\'92 he said. \'91I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.\'92\
\'91No indeed!\'92 said Boromir. \'91Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch?\'92\
\'91Maybe,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But I do not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts.\'92\
Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was high and flat-topped,\
\
416 the fellowship of the ring\
and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.\
Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.\
\'91It looks like a tomb,\'92 muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:\
 \
a journey in the dark 417\
\'91These are Daeron\'92s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:\
balin son of fundin lord of moria.\'92\
\'91He is dead then,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I feared it was so.\'92 Gimli cast his hood over his face.\
\
Chapter 5\
THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DU\'88 M\
The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin\'92s visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world.\
At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of Balin\'92s fate, or show what had become of his folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and helms. Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.\
There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves cracked and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli stand- ing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and there in Elvish script.\
At last Gandalf looked up. \'91It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin\'92s folk,\'92 he said. \'91I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after their\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 419\
arrival. The top page is marked one \'96 three, so at least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard \'96 I think; the next word is blurred and burned: probably room \'96 we slew many in the bright \'96 I think \'96 sun in the dale. Flo\uc0\u32 \u769 i was killed by an arrow. He slew the great. Then there is a blur followed by Flo\u32 \u769 i under grass near Mirror mere. The next line or two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. Then Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91The Chamber of Records,\'92 said Gimli. \'91I guess that is where we now stand.\'92\
\'91Well, I can read no more for a long way,\'92 said Gandalf, \'91except the word gold, and Durin\'92s Axe and something helm. Then Balin is now lord of Moria. That seems to end a chapter. After 
\f1 some stars another hand begins, and I can see we found truesilver, and later the word wellforged, and then something, I have it! mithril; and the last two lines O\uc0\u32 \u769  in to seek for the upper armouries of Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin
\f0  gate.\'92\
Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. \'91There are several pages of the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged,\'92 he said; \'91but I can make little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves missing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot read them. We might do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script.\'92\
\'91That would be Ori\'92s hand,\'92 said Gimli, looking over the wizard\'92s arm. \'91He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.\'92\
\'91I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it ends in estre. Yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria\

fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, but many more . . . up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read we have barred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible and suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all.\'92 He paused and sighed.\
\'91It is grim reading,\'92 he said. \'91I fe
\f1 ar their end was cruel. Listen! We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. Fra\uc0\u32 \u769 r and Lo\u32 \u769 ni and Na\u32 \u769 li fell there. Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took O\u32 \u769  in. We cannot get out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they are coming. There is n
\f0 othing more.\'92 Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought.\
A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. \'91We cannot get out,\'92 muttered Gimli. \'91It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.\'92\
Gandalf raised his head and looked round. \'91They seem to have made a last stand by both doors,\'92 he said; \'91but there were not many left by that time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The time is not come yet.
\f1  Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in, if you get 
\f0 a chance. It will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning is passing.\'92\
\'91Which way shall we go?\'92 asked Boromir.\
\'91Back to the hall,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91But our visit to this room has not been in vain. I now know where we are. This\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 421\
must be, as Gimli says, the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall!\'92\
Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound of many feet.\
\'91They are coming!\'92 cried Legolas.\
\'91We cannot get out,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91Trapped!\'92 cried Gandalf. \'91Why did I delay? Here we are,\
caught, just as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what\'97\'97\'92\
Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook.\
\'91Slam the doors and wedge them!\'92 shouted Aragorn. \'91And keep your packs on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go that way, if we get a chance.\'92\
Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges. Boromir set his shoulder against the western door.\
\'91Wait a moment! Do not close it yet!\'92 said Gandalf. He sprang forward to Boromir\'92s side and drew himself up to his full height.\
\'91Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria?\'92 he cried in a loud voice.\
There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding\
\
422 the fellowship of the ring\
stones into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, boom, doom went the drums in the deep. With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the nar- row opening of the door and thrust forward his staff. There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out. Arrows whined\
and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back.\
\'91There are Orcs, very many of them,\'92 he said. \'91And some are large and evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. There is no hope\
of escape that way.\'92\
\'91And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,\'92\
said Boromir.\
\'91There is no sound outside here yet,\'92 said Aragorn, who\
was standing by the eastern door listening. \'91The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot bloc
\f1 k the door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of Mazarbul!\'92 he said grimly, feeling the edge of his sword, Andu\uc0\u32 \u769 ril.\

\f0 Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung him- self against the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.\
Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was notched.\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 423\
Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. \'91The Shire!\'92 he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo\'92s arm. Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again.\
\'91One for the Shire!\'92 cried Aragorn. \'91The hobbit\'92s bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo!\'92\
There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast and a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber.\
How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp, but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on Balin\'92s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thir- teen had fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards, if he had seen it.\
\'91Now is the time!\'92 cried Gandalf. \'91Let us go, before the troll returns!\'92\
But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the door- way. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir\'92s sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn\'92s blow with the speed of a striking snake he\
\
424 the fellowship of the ring\
charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as the orc flu
\f1 ng down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Andu\uc0\u32 \u769  ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.\

\f0 Doom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out again.\
\'91Now!\'92 shouted Gandalf. \'91Now is the last chance. Run for it!\'92\
Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered by Balin\'92s tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to, grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could not be fastened.\
\'91I am all right,\'92 gasped Frodo. \'91I can walk. Put me down!\'92\
Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. \'91I thought you were dead!\'92 he cried.\
\'91Not yet!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91But there is no time for wonder. Off you go, all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards.\'92\
\'91We cannot leave you to hold the door alone!\'92 said Aragorn.\
\'91Do as I say!\'92 said Gandalf fiercely. \'91Swords are no more use here. Go!\'92\
The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard\'92s staff. He seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed heavily\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 425\
and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, doom.\
Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.\
\'91Well, well! That\'92s over!\'92 said the wizard struggling to his feet. \'91I have done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been destroyed. But don\'92t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!\'92\
They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom went the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were following. There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.\
At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.\
\'91It is getting hot!\'92 he gasped. \'91We ought to be down at least to the level of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look\
\
426 the fellowship of the ring\
for a left-hand turn to take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a moment, even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us.\'92\
Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. \'91What happened away up there at the door?\'92 he asked. \'91Did you meet the beater of the drums?\'92\
\'91I do not know,\'92 answered Gandalf. \'91But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting-spell on the door. I know many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by strength.\
\'91As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was gha\'88sh: that is \'91\'91fire\'92\'92. Then something came into the chamber \'96 I felt it through the door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell.\
\'91What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door left my control and began to open! I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown back- wards down the stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think.\
\'91I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.\'92\
\'91What about me?\'92 said Frodo. \'91I am alive, and whole I think. I am bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.\'92\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 427\
\'91Well,\'92 said Aragorn, \'91I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar!\'92\
\'91Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,\'92 said Frodo; \'91though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.\'92 He said no more. He found breathing painful.\
\'91You take after Bilbo,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.\'92 Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said.\
They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in the dark. \'91I think,\'92 he said, \'91that there is a light ahead. But it is not daylight. It is red. What can it be?\'92\
\'91Gha\'88sh!\'92 muttered Gandalf. \'91I wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.\'92\
Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low archway; through it the growing light came. The air became very hot.\
When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.\
\'91There is some new devilry here,\'92 he said, \'91devised for our welcome, no doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road, through the First Hall, and out! But come and look!\'92\
They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away\
\
428 the fellowship of the ring\
into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of tower- ing pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.\
\'91If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,\'92 said Gandalf. \'91Let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.\'92\
Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn-calls. Doom, doom: the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver.\
\'91Now for the last race!\'92 said Gandalf. \'91If the sun is shining outside, we may still escape. After me!\'92\
He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo\'92s head.\
Boromir laughed. \'91They did not expect this,\'92 he said. \'91The fire has cut them off. We are on the wrong side!\'92\
\'91Look ahead!\'92 called Gandalf. \'91The Bridge is near. lt is dangerous and narrow.\'92\
Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 429\
\'91Lead the way, Gimli!\'92 he said. \'91Pippin and Merry next. Straight on, and up the stair beyond the door!\'92\
Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf\'92s hat and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, doom, doom.\
Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror. The ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it.\
It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.\
\'91Ai! ai!\'92 wailed Legolas. \'91A Balrog! A Balrog is come!\'92\
Gimli stared with wide eyes. \'91Durin\'92s Bane!\'92 he cried, and letting his axe fall he covered his face.\
\'91A Balrog,\'92 muttered Gandalf. \'91Now I understand.\'92 He faltered and leaned heavily on his staff. \'91What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.\'92\
The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways. Then\
\
430 the fellowship of the ring\
Boromir raised his horn and blew. Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and the enemy advanced again.\
\'91Over the bridge!\'92 cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. \'91Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly!\'92 Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within the doorway at the hall\'92s end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone.\
The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.\
\'91You cannot pass,\'92 he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. \'91I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udu\'88n. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.\'92\
The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.\
From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. Glamdring glittered white in answer.\
There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The\
Balrog fell back, and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.\
\
the bridge of khazad-du\'88 m 431\
\'91You cannot pass!\'92 he said.\
With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.\
\'91He cannot stand alone!\'92 cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. \'91Elendil!\'92 he shouted. \'91I am with you, Gandalf !\'92\
\'91Gondor!\'92 cried Boromir and leaped after him.\
At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog\'92s feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.\
With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard\'92s knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. \'91Fly, you fools!\'92 he cried, and was gone.\
The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.\
\'91Come! I will lead you now!\'92 he called. \'91We must obey his last command. Follow me!\'92\
They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door, Aragorn leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow; doom!\
They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors they passed,\
\
432 the fellowship of the ring\
and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of blazing light.\
There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door-posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.\
Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces.\
They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high.\
They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded.\

\'91Alas! I fear we cannot stay here longer,\'92 said Aragorn. He looked towards the mountains and held up his sword. \'91Fare- well, Gandalf !\'92 he cried. \'91Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware? Alas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you?\'92\
He turned to the Company. \'91We must do without hope,\'92 he said. \'91At least we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We have a long road, and much to do.\'92\
They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras, the Mountains of Moria. At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains\'92 feet.\
\'91Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,\'92 said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. \'91Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have come, if fortune had been kinder.\'92\
\'91Or Caradhras less cruel,\'92 said Gimli. \'91There he stands smiling in the sun!\'92 He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned away.\
To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the\
\
434 the fellowship of the ring\
sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim.\
\'91There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-za\'88ram!\'92 said Gimli sadly. \'91I remember that he said: \'91\'91May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger there.\'92\'92 Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must hasten away, and he that must remain.\'92\
The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and broken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands to the Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top.\
\'91That is Durin\'92s Stone!\'92 cried Gimli. \'91I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale!\'92 \'91Be swift then!\'92 said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. \'91The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we must be far away before nightfall.\
The Moon is almost spent, and it will be dark tonight.\'92 \'91Come with me, Frodo!\'92 cried the dwarf, springing from the road. \'91I would not have you go without seeing Kheled- za\'88ram.\'92 He ran down the long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and\
weariness; Sam came up behind.\
Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It\
was cracked and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. \'91This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,\'92 said the dwarf. \'91Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!\'92\
They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see\
\

\f1 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 435\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 nothing. Then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen.\
\'91O Kheled-za\'88ram fair and wonderful!\'92 said Gimli. \'91There lies the Crown of Durin till he wakes. Farewell!\'92 He bowed, and turned away, and hastened back up the greensward to the road again.\
\'91What did you see?\'92 said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in thought to answer.\
The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel.\
\'91Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises,\'92 said Gimli. \'91Do not drink of it! It is icy cold.\'92\
\'91Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other mountain-streams,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Our road leads beside it for many miles. For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River \'96 out yonder.\'92 They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91There lie the woods of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien!\'92 said Legolas. \'91That is the fairest of all the d
\f0 wellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood\
\
436 the fellowship of the ring\
say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime!\'92\
\'91My heart will be glad, even in the winter,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But it lies many miles away. Let us hasten!\'92\
For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam\'92s cut was burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath.\
At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come with him.\
\'91I am sorry, Frodo!\'92 he cried, full of concern. \'91So much has happened this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease you, as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria were after us. Come now! A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.\'92\
Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle-berry. At the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was westering.\
While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam\'92s wound was not deep, but it looked ugly,\
\

\f1 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 437\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 and Aragorn\'92s face was grave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up with relief.\
\'91Good luck, Sam!\'92 he said. \'91Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc. The cut is not poisoned, as the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.\'92\
He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. \'91They are dry, and some of their virtue has gone,\'92 he said, \'91but here I have still some of the leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water, and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn, Frodo!\'92\
\'91I am all right,\'92 said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. \'91All I needed was some food and a little rest.\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Aragorn. \'91We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.\'92 Gently he stripped off Frodo\'92s old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool.\
\'91Look, my friends!\'92 he called. \'91Here\'92s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.\'92\
\'91And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,\'92 said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. \'91It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given!\'92\
\'91I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his little room,\'92 said Merry. \'91Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it!\'92\
\
438 the fellowship of the ring\
There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo\'92s right side and breast. Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo\'92s left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set the food ready, Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.\
\'91The mail is marvellously light,\'92 he said. \'91Put it on again, if you can bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.\'92\
When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to the road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours.\
It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, but the fast-waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence.\
\'91Not a sound but the wind,\'92 he said. \'91There are no goblins near, or my ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 439\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 that was all their purpose, and they had nothing else to do with us \'96 with the Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.\'92\
Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they slipped aside and vanished.\
\'91What is it?\'92 said the dwarf.\
\'91I don\'92t know,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91I thought I heard feet, and I thought I saw a light \'96 like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered Moria.\'92\
Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. \'91I hear nothing but the night-speech of plant and stone,\'92 he said. \'91Come! Let us hurry! The others are out of sight.\'92\
The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien!\'92 cried Legolas. \'91Lothlo\u32 \u769 rien! We have come to the eaves of the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winte
\f0 r!\'92\
Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold.\

\f1 \'91Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien!\'92 s
\f0 aid Aragorn. \'91Glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind.\'92\
\'91If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago,\'92\
\
440 the fellowship of the ring\

\f1 said Legolas, \'91but we hear that Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien is 
\f0 not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border.\'92\
\'91Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,\'92 said Aragorn, and sighed as if some memory stirred in him. \'91We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.\'92\
He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. \'91Is there no other way?\'92 he said.\
\'91What other fairer way would you desire?\'92 said Aragorn.\
\'91A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,\'92 said Boromir. \'91By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune. Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few none have escaped unscathed.\'92\

\f1 \'91Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak the truth,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. Believe what you will, there is 
\f0 no other way for us \'96 unless you would go back to Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all alone.\'92\
\'91Then lead on!\'92 said Boromir. \'91But it is perilous.\'92\
\'91Perilous indeed,\'92 said Aragorn, \'91fair and perilous; but only evil need fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!\'92\
They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across\
\

\f1 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 441\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees.\
\'91Here is Nimrodel!\'92 said Legolas. \'91Of this stream the Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the North, remembering the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.\'92 He went forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream.\
\'91Follow me!\'92 he cried. \'91The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.\'92\
One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien that the Elves of Mirkw
\f0 ood still kept in their hearts, of sun- light and starlight upon the meadows by the Great River before the world was grey.\
At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water.\
\'91Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel?\'92 asked Legolas. \'91I will sing you a song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived long ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.\'92 In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began:\
\
442 the fellowship of the ring\
An Elven-maid there was of old, A shining star by day:\
Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, Her shoes of silver-grey.\
A star was bound upon her brows, A light was on her hair\

\f1 As sun upon the golden boughs In Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien the fair.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Her hair was long, her limbs were white, And fair she was and free;\
And in the wind she went as light As leaf of linden-tree.\
Beside the falls of Nimrodel, By water clear and cool,\
Her voice as falling silver fell Into the shining pool.\
Where now she wanders none can tell, In sunlight or in shade;\
For lost of yore was Nimrodel And in the mountains strayed.\
The elven-ship in haven grey Beneath the mountain-lee Awaited her for many a day\
Beside the roaring sea.\
A wind by night in Northern lands Arose, and loud it cried,\
And drove the ship from elven-strands Across the streaming tide.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 443\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 When dawn came dim the land was lost, The mountains sinking grey\
Beyond the heaving waves that tossed Their plumes of blinding spray.\
Amroth beheld the fading shore Now low beyond the swell,\
And cursed the faithless ship that bore Him far from Nimrodel.\
Of old he was an Elven-king, A lord of tree and glen,\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 When golden were the boughs in spring In fair Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 From helm to sea they saw him leap, As arrow from the string,\
And dive into the water deep, As mew upon the wing.\
The wind was in his flowing hair, The foam about him shone;\
Afar they saw him strong and fair Go riding like a swan.\
But from the West has come no word, And on the Hither Shore\
No tidings Elven-folk have heard Of Amroth evermore.\
The
\f1  voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. \'91I can- not sing any more,\'92 he said. \'91That is but a part, for I have forgotten much. It is long and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, Lo\u32 \u769 rien of the Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evi
\f0 l in the mountains.\'92\
\'91But the Dwarves did not make the evil,\'92 said Gimli.\
\'91I said not so; yet evil came,\'92 answered Legolas sadly. \'91Then\
\
444 the fellowship of the ring\
many of the Elves of Nimrodel\'92s kindred left their dwellings and departed, and she was lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Mountains; and she came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her name. A
\f1 nd when the wind is in the South the voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin flows into the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien set sail.
\f0  But neither Nimrodel nor Amroth came ever back.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, to dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the Galadhrim, the Tree-people. Deep in
\f0  their forest the trees are very great. The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build strong places of stone before the Shadow came.\'92\
\'91And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground,\'92 said Gimli. He looked across the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark boughs above.\
\'91Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91We cannot build a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise.\'92\
The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but their height could not be guessed.\
\'91I will climb up,\'92 said Legolas. \'91I am at home among trees, by root or bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in song. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, but I have never climbed\
\

\f1 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 445\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 in one. I will see now what is their shape and way of growth.\'92 \'91Whatever it may be,\'92 said Pippin, \'91they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds.\
I cannot sleep on a perch!\'92\
\'91Then dig a hole in the ground,\'92 said Legolas, \'91if that is more\
after the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to hide from Orcs.\'92 He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.\
\'91Daro!\'92 it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.\
\'91Stand still!\'92 he whispered to the others. \'91Do not move or speak!\'92\
There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and answered in the same language.*\
\'91Who are they, and what do they say?\'92 asked Merry. \'91They\'92re Elves,\'92 said Sam. \'91Can\'92t you hear their voices?\'92 \'91Yes, they are Elves,\'92 said Legolas; \'91and they say that you\
breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark.\'92 Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth. \'91But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey. The others they ask to wait a little, and to keep watch at the foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.\'92\
*** * See note in Appendix F: Of the Elves.\
\
446 the fellowship of the ring\
Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or flet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed.\
When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy- grey, and could not be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo\'92s face, and Sam\'92s. Then he shut off the light again, and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.\
\'91Welcome!\'92 the Elf then said again in the Common Lan- guage, speaking slowly. \'91We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gath
\f1 ering of news and the watching of our enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name. My brothers, Ru\uc0\u32 \u769 mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue.\

\f0 \'91But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the mess- engers of Elron
\f1 d passed by Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of \'96 hobbits, of halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf of our kindred, we are
\f0  willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight. How many are you?\'92\
\

\f1 \cf0 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 447\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91Eight,\'92 said Legolas. \'91Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien,\'92 said Haldir, \'91and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet spoken only of seven.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91The eighth is a dwarf,\'92 said Legolas.\
\'91A dwarf !\'92 said Haldir. \'91That is not well. We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I cannot allow him to pass.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Da\uc0\u32 \u769 in\'92s trusty people, and friendly to Elrond,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions, and he has been brave and faithful.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Leg
\f1 olas in their own tongue. \'91Very good,\'92 said Haldir at last. \'91We will do this, though it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\

\f0 \'91But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north towards Moria, along the skirts of the mountains, many days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood\'92s borders. If you have indeed come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go on.\
\'91The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us \'96 we do not fear them! There is another talan in the next tree. There the others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!\'92\
Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir\'92s message; and soon afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out of breath and seemed rather scared.\
\'91There!\'92 said Merry panting. \'91We have lugged up your\
\
448 the fellowship of the ring\
blankets as well as our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of our baggage in a deep drift of leaves.\'92\
\'91You had no need of your burdens,\'92 said Haldir. \'91It is cold in the tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have skins and cloaks to spare.\'92\
The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.\
Pippin went on talking for a while. \'91I hope, if I do go to sleep in this bird-loft, that I shan\'92t roll off,\'92 he said.\
\'91Once I do get to sleep,\'92 said Sam, \'91I shall go on sleeping, whether I roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I\'92ll drop off, if you take my meaning.\'92\
Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of Legolas running in his mind.\
Late in the night he woke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind was still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits.\
\'91What is it?\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Yrch!\'92 said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the rope-ladder rolled up.\
\'91Orcs!\'92 said Frodo. \'91What are they doing?\'92 But the Elf had gone.\
There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very falls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shiv- ered in his wraps. He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame; and then slowly faded again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the tree\'92s foot far below.\
Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing; and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the dark, holding his breath.\
Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished.\
Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches. \'91There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,\'92 he said. \'91It was not an orc. It fled as soon as I touched the tree-stem. It seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought that it was one of you hobbits.\
\

\'91I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle. A strong company of Orcs has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel \'96 curse their foul feet in its clean water! \'96 and went on down the old road beside the river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people. None of the Orcs will ever return out of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you must take the road south as so
\f0 on as it is fully light.\'92\
Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer\'92s morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the moving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze.\

\f1 The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, guided now by Haldir and his brother Ru\uc0\u32 \u769 mil
\f0 . \'91Farewell, sweet Nimrodel!\'92 cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree-stems. \'91Farewell,\'92 he said. It seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless changeful music.\
They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the prints of orc-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows.\
\'91There is one of my people yonder across the stream,\'92 he said, \'91though you may not see him.\'92 He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood thrown back; his\
\

\f1 lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 451\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank.\
\'91Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,\'92 said Haldir, \'91and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!\'92 He made his end of the rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and back again, as if he were on a road.\
\'91I can walk this path,\'92 said Legolas; \'91but the others have not this skill. Must they swim?\'92\
\'91No!\'92 said Haldir. \'91We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above the other, one shoulder-high, and another half- high, and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care.\'92\
When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains.\
He breathed with relief when he was safely across. \'91Live and learn! as my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. Ru\uc0\u32 \u769 mil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it
\f0  on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep watch.\

\f1 \'91Now, friends,\'92 said Haldir, \'91you have entered the Naith of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, or the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spearhead between the arms of 
\f0 Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers to spy out the\
\
452 the fellowship of the ring\
secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there.\
\'91As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The others may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.\'92\
This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. \'91The agreement was made without my consent,\'92 he said. \'91I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.\'92\
\'91I do not doubt you,\'92 said Haldir. \'91Yet this is our law. I am not the master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant.\'92\
Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his hand upon the haft of his axe. \'91I will go forward free,\'92 he said, \'91or I will go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I perish alone in the wilderness.\'92\
\'91You cannot go back,\'92 said Haldir sternly. \'91Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.\'92\
Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their bows. \'91A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks!\'92 said Legolas.\
\'91Come!\'92 said Aragorn. \'91If I am still to lead this Company, you must do as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey slow and dull.\'92\
Gimli laughed suddenly. \'91A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.\'92\
\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91I am an Elf and a kinsman here,\'92 said Legolas, becoming angry in his turn.\
\'91Now let us cry: \'91\'91a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!\'92\'92\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes, Haldir!\'92\
\'91I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well,\'92 said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.\
\'91You will have no claim,\'92 said Haldir. \'91I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and straight.\'92\
\'91Alas for the folly of these days!\'92 said Legolas. \'91Here all are enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold!\'92\
\'91Folly it may seem,\'92 said Haldir. \'91Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark
\f1  Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land. We
\f0  live now upon an island amid many perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.\
\'91The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more; for the Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for that it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron\'92s creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come to the shores of the Sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. It is said that there are still havens of the High Elves, but they are far north and west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.\'92\
\'91You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,\'92 said Merry. \'91There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire, where Hobbits live.\'92\
\'91Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the\
\
454 the fellowship of the ring\
sea!\'92 said Haldir. \'91It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.\'92\
\'91I cannot,\'92 said Merry. \'91I have never seen them. I have never been out of my own land before. And if I had known what the world outside was like, I don\'92t think I should have had the heart to leave it.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Not even to see fair Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien?\'92 said Haldir. \'91The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there
\f0  is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.\
\'91Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back, and peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will eve
\f1 r again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien that I love! It would be
\f0  a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea, none have reported it.\'92\
As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the trodden grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear voices of birds high in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade.\
As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days, and was now walking in a world that was no mor
\f1 e. In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien the\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 ancient things still lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside: wolves w
\f1 ere howling on the wood\'92s borders: but on the land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien no shadow lay.\

\f0 All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him.\
A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening towards the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they brought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet not of beast-shape. It had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode southward.\
\'91Also,\'92 said Haldir, \'91they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.\'92\
He removed the bandage first from Gimli\'92s eyes. \'91Your pardon!\'92 he said, bowing low. \'91Look on us now with friend
\f1 ly eyes! Look and be glad, for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien since Durin\'92s Day!\'92\

\f0 When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his breath. They were standing in an open space.\
\
456 the fellowship of the ring\
To the left stood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.\
\'91Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,\'92 said Haldir. \'91For this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk.\'92\
The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived 
\f1 them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien there was no stain.\

\f0 \cf0 He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. \'91It\'92s sunlight and bright day, right enough,\'92 he said. \'91I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take my meaning.\'92\
Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word. He smiled. \'91You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim,\'92 he said. \'91Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?\'92\
They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there, u
\f1 pon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\

\f0 They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth.\
Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree\'92s skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself.\
As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand and turned him towards the South. \'91Look this way first!\'92 he said.\
Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, it seemed to him that the power and light\
\
458 the fellowship of the ring\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 came that held all the land in sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then he looked east- ward and saw all the land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien running down to the pa
\f0 le gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away it rose again like a wall
\f1 , dark and drear. The sun that lay on Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,\'92 said Haldir. \'91It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet.\'92 He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.\
At the hill\'92s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimel
\f1 da, nama\uc0\u32 \u769 rie\u32 \u776 ! he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled.\

\f0 \'91Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,\'92 he said, \'91and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me!\'92 And taking Frodo\'92s hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.\

Chapter 7\
THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL\
The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were deepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps.\
Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the twilight like living towers. In their many-tiered branches and amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and silver. Haldir turned towards the Company.\
\'91Welcome to Caras Galadhon!\'92 he said. \'91H
\f1 ere is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is great.\'92\

\f0 There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last to a white\
\
460 the fellowship of the ring\
bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps.\
Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened sound- lessly; but of guards Frodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, about them, and in the air above. Far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves.\
They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.\
\'91Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,\'92 said Haldir. \'91It is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them.\'92\
One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it was answered three times from far above. \'91I will go first,\'92 said Haldir. \'91Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs, but you may rest upon the way.\'92\
As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and some set about the bole\
\
the mirror of galadriel 461\
of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.\
The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the wells of deep memory.\
Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face.\
\'91Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire!\'92 said Cele- born. \'91When all have come we will speak together.\'92\
Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. \'91Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn!\'92 he said. \'91It is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for a while!\'92\

\f1 \cf0 \'91Welcome Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in! It is long indeed since we saw one of Durin\'92s folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May it be a sign that though the\

462 the fellowship of the ring\
world is now dark better days are at hand, and that friendship\
shall be renewed between our peoples.\'92 Gimli bowed low.\
When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at them again. \'91Here there are eight,\'92 he said. \'91Nine were to set out: so said the messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this year the shadows have grown longer.\'92\
\'91Nay, there was no change of counsel,\'92 said the Lady Galadriel, speaking for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman\'92s wont. \'91Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak 
\f1 with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the fences of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me.\'92\

\f0 \'91Alas!\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained in Moria and did not escape.\'92\
At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement. \'91These are evil tidings,\'92 said Celeborn, \'91the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.\'92 He turned to Haldir. \'91Why has nothing of this been told to me before?\'92 he asked in the elven-tongue.\
\'91We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our pur- pose,\'92 said Legolas. \'91At first we were weary and danger was too close behind; and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
\f1  time, as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien.\'92\

\f0 \'91Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.\'92\
\'91Tell us now the full tale!\'92 said Celeborn.\
Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he\
\
the mirror of galadriel 463\
spoke of Balin and his book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow bridge, and the coming of the Terror. \'91An evil of the Ancient World it seemed, such as I have never seen before,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91It was both a shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.\'92\
\'91It was a Balrog of Morgoth,\'92 said Legolas; \'91of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.\'92\
\'91Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our dark- est dreams, I saw Durin\'92s Bane,\'92 said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.\
\'91Alas!\'92 said Celeborn. \'91We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in Moria again, I would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you and all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria.\'92\
\'91He would be rash indeed that said that thing,\'92 said Galadriel gravely. \'91Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind and 
\f1 cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, who of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would p
\f0 ass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons?\
\'91Dark is the water of Kheled-za\'88ram, and cold are the springs of Kibil-na\'88la, and fair were the many-pillared halls of Khazad-du\'88m in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.\'92 She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled in answer.\
He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: \'91Yet\
\
464 the fellowship of the ring\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 more fair is the living land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, and the Lady Galadriel\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth!\'92\
There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. \'91I did not know that your plight was so evil,\'92 he said. \'91Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden.\'92\
\'91Your quest is known to us,\'92 said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. \'91But we will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle- earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.\
\'91I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail; but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But this I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while all the Company is true.\'92\
And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head.\
At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she smiled. \'91Do not let your hearts be troubled,\'92 she said. \'91Tonight you shall sleep in peace.\'92 Then they sighed and felt\
\
the mirror of galadriel 465\
suddenly weary, as those who have been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly.\
\'91Go now!\'92 said Celeborn. \'91You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will not speak of your further road for a while.\'92\
That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace with fair Elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day\'92s journey, and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further back.\
\'91What did you blush for, Sam?\'92 said Pippin. \'91You soon broke down. Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.\'92\
\'91I never thought no such thing,\'92 answered Sam, in no mood for jest. \'91If you want to know, I felt as if I hadn\'92t got nothing on, and I didn\'92t like it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole with \'96 with a bit of garden of my own.\'92\
\'91That\'92s funny,\'92 said Merry. \'91Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I don\'92t think I\'92ll say any more,\'92 he ended lamely.\
All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against Sauron to others.\
\'91And it seemed to me, too,\'92 said Gimli, \'91that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself.\'92\
\
466 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91To me it seemed exceedingly strange,\'92 said Boromir. \'91Maybe it was only a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but almost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she pretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.\'92 But what he thought that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell.\
And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions. \'91She held you long in her gaze, Ring-bearer,\'92 he said.\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Frodo; \'91but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there.\'92\
\'91Well, have a care!\'92 said Boromir. \'91I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and her purposes.\'92\
\'91Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel!\'92 said Aragorn sternly. \'91You know not what you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man bring it hither himself. Then let him beware! But tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.\'92 He cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep.\
The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 They remained some days in Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, so far as they could tell or remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean. The air was c
\f0 ool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; and it was enough.\
They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had\
\
the mirror of galadriel 467\
little speech with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue. Haldir had bidden them fare- well and gone back again to the fences of the North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the Company had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change.\
Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand.\
Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they loved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Com- pany, he would not interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.\
It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with man
\f1 y things that others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained,
\f0  faded as a handful of withered leaves.\
When evening in the Shire was grey his footsteps on the Hill were heard; before the dawn he went away\
on journey long without a word.\
\
468\
the fellowship of the ring\
From Wilderland to Western shore, from northern waste to southern hill, through dragon-lair and hidden door and darkling woods he walked at will.\
With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men, with mortal and immortal folk,\
with bird on bough and beast in den,\
in their own secret tongues he spoke.\
A deadly sword, a healing hand, a back that bent beneath its load; a trumpet-voice, a burning brand, a weary pilgrim on the road.\
A lord of wisdom throned he sat, swift in anger, quick to laugh; an old man in a battered hat who leaned upon a thorny staff.\
He stood upon the bridge alone and Fire and Shadow both defied; his staff was broken on the stone, in Khazad-du\'88m his wisdom died.\
\'91Why, you\'92ll be beating Mr. Bilbo next!\'92 said Sam.\
\'91No, I am afraid not,\'92 said Frodo. \'91But that is the best I can do yet.\'92\
\'91Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you\'92ll say a word about his fireworks,\'92 said Sam. \'91Something like this:\
The finest rockets ever seen:\
they burst in stars of blue and green, or after thunder golden showers came falling like a rain of flowers.\
\
the mirror of galadriel 469\
Though that doesn\'92t do them justice by a long road.\'92\
\'91No, I\'92ll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But \'96 well, I can\'92t talk of it any more. I can\'92t bear to think\
of bringing the news to him.\'92\

\f1 One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight. Both of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91What do you think of Elves now, Sam?\'92 he said. \'91I asked you the same question once before \'96 it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more of them since then.\'92\
\'91I have indeed!\'92 said Sam. \'91And I reckon there\'92s Elves and Elves. They\'92re all Elvish enough, but they\'92re not all the same. Now these folk aren\'92t wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they seem to belong here, more even than Hobbits do in the Shire. Whether they\'92ve made the land, or the land\'92s made them, it\'92s hard to say, if you take my meaning. It\'92s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and nobody seems to want it to. If there\'92s any magic about, it\'92s right down deep, where I can\'92t lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.\'92\
\'91You can see and feel it everywhere,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Well,\'92 said Sam, \'91you can\'92t see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don\'92t see nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, if she had a mind. I\'92d dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!\'92\
\'91I wouldn\'92t,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I am content. And I don\'92t miss Gandalf\'92s fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.\'92\
\'91You\'92re right,\'92 said Sam. \'91And don\'92t think I\'92m finding fault. I\'92ve often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but I\'92ve never heard of a better land than this. It\'92s like being at home and on a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don\'92t want to leave. All the same, I\'92m\
\
470 the fellowship of the ring\
beginning to feel that if we\'92ve got to go on, then we\'92d best get it over.\
\'91It\'92s the job that\'92s never started as takes longest to finish, as my old gaffer used to say. And I don\'92t reckon that these folk can do much more to help us, magic or no. It\'92s when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I\'92m thinking.\'92\
\'91I am afraid that\'92s only too true, Sam,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.\'92\
Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, the Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them.\
Turning aside, she led them towards the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into the deep green hollow, through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a silver ewer.\
With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. \'91Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,\'92 she said. \'91I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if you will.\'92\
The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf- lady beside him was tall and pale. \'91What shall we look for, and what shall we see?\'92 asked Frodo, filled with awe.\
\'91Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,\'92 she answered, \'91and to some I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror free to\
\
the mirror of galadriel 471\
work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that are, and things that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish to look?\'92\
Frodo did not answer.\
\'91And you?\'92 she said, turning to Sam. \'91For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?\'92\
\'91I did,\'92 said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curi- osity. \'91I\'92ll have a peep, Lady, if you\'92re willing.\
\'91And I\'92d not mind a glimpse of what\'92s going on at home,\'92 he said in an aside to Frodo. \'91It seems a terrible long time that I\'92ve been away. But there, like as not I\'92ll only see the stars, or something that I won\'92t understand.\'92\
\'91Like as not,\'92 said the Lady with a gentle laugh. \'91But come, you shall look and see what you may. Do not touch the water!\'92\
Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it.\
\'91There\'92s only stars, as I thought,\'92 he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees were waving and toss- ing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were falling, crashing to the ground.\
\
472 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Hi!\'92 cried Sam in an outraged voice. \'91There\'92s that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he shouldn\'92t. They didn\'92t ought to be felled: it\'92s that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could get at Ted, and I\'92d fell him!\'92\
But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror.\
\'91There\'92s some devilry at work in the Shire,\'92 he said. \'91Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.\'92 Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away. \'91I can\'92t stay here,\'92 he said wildly. \'91I must go home. They\'92ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there\'92s the poor old Gaffer going down the Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home!\'92\
\'91You cannot go home alone,\'92 said the Lady. \'91You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.\'92\
Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. \'91I wish I had never come here, and I don\'92t want to see no more magic,\'92 he said and fell silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. \'91No, I\'92ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,\'92 he said. \'91But I hope I do get back some day. If what I\'92ve seen turns out true, somebody\'92s going to catch it hot!\'92\
\'91Do you now wish to look, Frodo?\'92 said the Lady Galadriel. \'91You did not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.\'92\
\'91Do you advise me to look?\'92 asked Frodo.\
\'91No,\'92 she said. \'91I do not counsel you one way or the other.\
\
the mirror of galadriel 473\
I am not a counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will!\'92\
\'91I will look,\'92 said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called aloud the wizard\'92s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirror\'92s view. Doubt came into Frodo\'92s mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?\
The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beat- ing on the windows.\
Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke\
\
474 the fellowship of the ring\
as of fire and battle arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.\
But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat\'92s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.\
Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him \'96 not yet, not unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water. He was slipping forward.\
\'91Do not touch the water!\'92 said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady.\
\'91I know what it was that you last saw,\'92 she said; \'91for that is also in my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the trees, nor even by th
\f1 e slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo, that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes 
\f0 ever to see me and my thought. But still the door is closed!\'92\
She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East in a gesture of rejection and denial. Ea\uc0\u32 \u776 rendil, the Evening Star, most beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of the Elven-lady cast\
\
the mirror of galadriel 475\
a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even- star had come down to rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.\
\'91Yes,\'92 she said, divining his thought, \'91it is not permitted to speak of it, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidd
\f1 en from the Ring-bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.\

\f0 \'91He suspects, but he does not know \'96 not yet. D
\f1 o you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it away. We must 
\f0 depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.\'92\
Frodo bent his head. \'91And what do you wish?\'92 he said at last.\
\'91That what should be shall be,\'92 she answered. \'91The love of the Elves for their land and
\f1  their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the fate of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien you are not answerable, but only
\f0  for the doing of your own task. Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.\'92\
\'91You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,\'92 said Frodo. \'91I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for me.\'92\
Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. \'91Wise the Lady Galadriel may be,\'92 she said, \'91yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to see with a\

keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?\
\'91And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the Light- ning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!\'92\
She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illumined her alone and left all else dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.\
\'91I pass the test,\'92 she said. \'91I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.\'92\
They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. \'91Let us return!\'92 she said. \'91In the morning you must depart, for now we have chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.\'92\
\'91I would ask one thing before we go,\'92 said Frodo, \'91a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am per- mitted to wear the One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them?\'92\
\'91You have not tried,\'92 she said. \'91Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you pos- sessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf\
\
the mirror of galadriel 477\
tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize the ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring?\'92 she asked turning again to Sam.\
\'91No, Lady,\'92 he answered. \'91To tell you the truth, I wondered what you were talking about. I saw a star through your fingers. But if you\'92ll pardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you\'92d take his Ring. You\'92d put things to rights. You\'92d stop them digging up the Gaffer and turning him adrift. You\'92d make some folk pay for their dirty work.\'92\
\'91I would,\'92 she said. \'91That is how it would begin. But it would not stop with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!\'92\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn spoke of their departure.\
\'91Now is the time,\'92 he said, \'91when those who wish to con- tinue the Quest must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go forward may remain here, for a while. But whethe
\f1 r they stay or go, none can be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien. Then they may r
\f0 eturn to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle.\'92\
There was a silence. \'91They all resolved to go forward,\'92 said Galadriel looking in their eyes.\
\'91As for me,\'92 said Boromir, \'91my way home lies onward and not back.\'92\
\'91That is true,\'92 said Celeborn, \'91but is all this Company going with you to Minas Tirith?\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91We have not decided our course,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Beyond Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear purpose.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91Maybe
\f1  not,\'92 said Celeborn, \'91yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien and Gondor, save by boat. And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken 
\f0 down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?\
\'91On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this side, upon the west; but the straight road of the\

\f0 \cf0 Quest lies east of the River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take?\'92\
\'91If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to Minas Tirith,\'92 answered Boromir. \'91But I am not the leader of the Company.\'92 The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled.\
\'91I see that you do not yet know what to do,\'92 said Celeborn. \'91It is not my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.\'92\
\'91And one Hobbit!\'92 cried Merry. \'91Not all of us look on boats as wild horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.\'92\
\'91That is well,\'92 said Celeborn. \'91Then I will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west \'96 or east.\'92\
Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubt- ful: he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them.\
\'91All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow,\'92 said Celeborn. \'91I will send my people to you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep.\'92\
\'91Good night, my friends!\'92 said Galadriel. \'91Sleep in peace!\
\
480 the fellowship of the ring\
Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though you do not see them. Good night!\'92\
The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for this was to be th
\f1 eir last night in Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together.\

\f0 For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring; but they came to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.\
His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?\
\'91I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,\'92 said Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling\'92s thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. \'91If you wish only to destroy the Ring,\'92 he said, \'91then there is little use in war and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw away.\'92 He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 farewell to lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 481\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 speaking his thoughts aloud. \'91It would be folly to throw lives away, I mean,\'92 he ended. \'91It is a choice between defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At least, that is how I see it.\'92\
Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir\'92s glance, and he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir\'92s thought was different from his final words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir\'92s words. And so their debate ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The night was growing old.\
In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slen- der goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.\
\'91Cram,\'92 he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.\
\'91No more, no more!\'92 cried the Elves laughing. \'91You have eaten enough already for a long day\'92s march.\'92\
\'91I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dale-men make for journeys in the wild,\'92 said the Dwarf.\
\'91So it is,\'92 they answered. \'91But we call it lembas or waybread, and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant than cram, by all accounts.\'92\
\'91Indeed it is,\'92 said Gimli. \'91Why, it is better than the honey- cakes of the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts!\'92\
\
482 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91All the same, we bid you spare the food,\'92 they said. \'91Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.\'92\
The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Com- pany the clothes they had brought. For each they had pro- vided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk- silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.\
\'91Are these magic cloaks?\'92 asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.\
\'91I do not know what you mean by that,\'92 answered the leader of the Elves. \'91They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are Elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they have the 
\f1 hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they
\f0  are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.\'92\
After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 fair place, and it had become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.\
\'91I have returned from the Northern Fences,\'92 said the Elf, \'91and I am sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the deeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.\'92\
As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn- trees, and passed on, winding through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and east- wards, towards the shores of the River.\
They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on 
\f1 southwards as far as eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\

\f0 On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were moored many boats and barges.\
\
484 the fellowship of the ring\
Some were brightly painted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks.\
\'91What are these?\'92 asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the greensward.\
\'91Ropes indeed!\'92 answered an Elf from the boats. \'91Never travel far without a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are these. They may be a help in many needs.\'92\
\'91You don\'92t need to tell me that!\'92 said Sam. \'91I came without any, and I\'92ve been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made of, knowing a bit about rope-making: it\'92s in the family as you might say.\'92\
\'91They are made of hithlain,\'92 said the Elf, \'91but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it serve you well!\'92\
\'91Come!\'92 said Haldir. \'91All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But take care at first!\'92\
\'91Heed the words!\'92 said the other Elves. \'91These boats are light-built, and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.\'92\
The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn led them on a trial up\
\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 the Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the trees drew down to the river\'92s brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.\
They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down the stream towards them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air:\
I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:\
Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew. Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,\
In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.\
There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching\
years,\
While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-\
tears.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 O Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. O Lo\u32 \u769 rien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
486 the fellowship of the ring\
But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,\
What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?\
Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended her song and greeted them. \'91We have come to bid our last farewell,\'92 she said, \'91and to speed you with blessings from our land.\'92\
\'91Though you have been our guests,\'92 said Celeborn, \'91you have not yet eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from L
\f1 o\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\'92\

\f0 The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible, nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later days Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of Time.\
After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue.\
\'91As you go down the water,\'92 he said, \'91you will find that the trees will fail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony vales amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the\

\f0 \cf0 further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor.\
\'91Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning.\'92\
\'91Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,\'92 said Boromir. \'91But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives\'92 tales, such as we tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years.\
\'91I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by the skirts of the White Moun- tains, and crossed the Isen and the Greyflood into Norther- land. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at the fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.\'92\
\'91Then I need say no more,\'92 said Celeborn. \'91But do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.\'92\
Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn.\
\
488 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,\'92 she said. \'91Drink, Lord of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad, though night must follow noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.\'92\
Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke again.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91We have drunk the cup of parting,\'92 she said, \'91and the shadows fall between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 
\f0 rien.\'92 Then she called to each in turn.\
\'91Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company,\'92 she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wro
\f1 ught of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven-runes formed of many gems the name Andu\uc0\u32 \u769 ril and the lineage of the sword.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat,\'92 she said. \'91But is there aught else that you desire of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning.\'92\
And Aragorn answered: \'91Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.\'92\
\'91Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,\'92 said Galadriel; \'91for it was left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.\'92 Then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of spring. \'91This 
\f1 stone I gave to Celebr\uc0\u32 \u769 \u305 an my daughter, and\

\f0 \cf0 she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the House of Elendil!\'92\
Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders. \'91For the gifts that
\f1  you have given me I thank you,\'92 he said, \'91O Lady of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien of whom were sprung Celebr\u32 \u769 \u305 an and Arwen Evenstar. What praise could I say more?\'92\

\f0 The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boro- mir, and to him she gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.\
\'91For you little gardener and lover of trees,\'92 she said to Sam, \'91I have only a small gift.\'92 She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. \'91Here is set G for Galadriel,\'92 she said; \'91but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, and catch a glimpse far 
\f1 off of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, that you have seen only in our winter. For our Spring and our Summer are gone by, and they will never be seen on earth again save in memory.\'92\

\f0 Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaud- ible, as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could.\
\'91And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?\'92 said Galadriel, turning to Gimli.\
\
490 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91None, Lady,\'92 answered Gimli. \'91It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Hear all ye Elves!\'92 she cried to those about her. \'91Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be the only guest without a gif
\f0 t.\'92\
\'91There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,\'92 said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. \'91Nothing, unless it might be \'96 unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire.\'92\
The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. \'91It is said that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues,\'92 she said; \'91yet that is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what would you do with such a gift?\'92\
\'91Treasure it, Lady,\'92 he answered, \'91in memory of your words to me at our first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.\'92\
Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli\'92s hand. \'91These words shall go with the gift,\'92 she said. \'91I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the one hand l
\f1 ies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in, that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \'91And you, Ring-bearer,\'92 she said, turning to Frodo. \'91I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.\'92 She held up a small crystal phial: it glittered\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 farewell to lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien 491\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 as she moved it, and rays of white light sprang from her hand. \'91In this phial,\'92 she said, \'91is caught the light of Ea\uc0\u32 \u776 rendil\'92s star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror!\'92\
Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say.\
Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow noon lay on the green land of 
\f1 the Tongue, and the water glittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters 
\f0 bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away fro
\f1 m them. For so it seemed to them: Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien was slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world.\

\f0 Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed southward. Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not under- stand the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him.\
\

Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Suddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either side, and the light of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came again.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was before them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. Gimli wept openly.\
\'91I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,\'92 he said to Legolas his companion. \'91Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be her gift.\'92 He put his hand to his breast.\
\'91Tell me, Legolas, why did I come on this Quest? Little did I know where the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared, 
\f1 and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in!\'92\

\f0 \'91Nay!\'92 said Legolas
\f1 . \'91Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, Gimli son of Glo\uc0\u32 \u769 in: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your com- panions, and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlo\u32 \u769 rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor gro
\f0 w stale.\'92\
\'91Maybe,\'92 said Gimli; \'91and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-za\'88ram. Or so says the heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. Not so for Dwarves.\
\

\'91But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the water with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water.\'92 He took up a paddle, and steered towards the western bank, following Aragorn\'92s boat ahead, which had already moved out of the middle stream.\
So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep.\
\
Chapter 9\
THE GREAT RIVER\
Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand.\
They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and 
\f1 journey on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\

\f0 Nonetheless they saw no sign of any enemy that day, nor the next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away towards the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence\
\
496 the fellowship of the ring\
or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.\
Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through open- ings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains.\
There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky.\
\'91Swans!\'92 said Sam. \'91And mighty big ones too!\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Aragorn, \'91and they are black swans.\'92\
\'91How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks!\'92\
said Frodo. \'91I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.\'92\
\'91But we have not journeyed far south yet,\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91It is still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold until the sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay of Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of the Southfarthing away in your Shire, hun- dreds of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White Mountains belonged\
\
the great river 497\
to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.\'92\
Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a river that was the frontier of war.\
In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Com- pany. For a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed
\f1  a chill air from the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. There was little speec
\f0 h and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the Company was busy with his own thoughts.\
The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady\'92s gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn\'92s. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were\
\
498 the fellowship of the ring\
maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imag- ined. He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one.\
As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.\
That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. \'91I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,\'92 he said. \'91Or maybe it wasn\'92t a dream. Funny it was anyway.\'92\
\'91Well, what was it?\'92 said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale
\f1 , whatever it was. \'91I haven\'92t seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\'92\

\f0 \'91It wasn\'92t funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it wasn\'92t a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with eyes!\'92\
\'91The log\'92s all right,\'92 said Frodo. \'91There are many in the River. But leave out the eyes!\'92\
\'91That I won\'92t,\'92 said Sam. \'91\'92Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind Gimli\'92s boat; but I didn\'92t give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the near end of the log. What\'92s more, it wasn\'92t a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan\'92s almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.\
\
the great river 499\
\'91That\'92s when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a shout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head. For the whatever-it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether I came to my senses, I don\'92t know. When I looked again, it wasn\'92t there. Yet I think I caught a glimpse, with the tail of my eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I couldn\'92t see no more eyes, though.\
\'91I said to myself: \'91\'91dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,\'92\'92 I said; and I said no more just then. But I\'92ve been thinking since, and now I\'92m not so sure. What do you make of it, Mr. Frodo?\'92\
\'91I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes, Sam,\'92 said Frodo, \'91if this was the first time
\f1  that those eyes had been seen. But it isn\'92t. I saw them away back north before we reached Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. And I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir saw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the 
\f0 orc-band?\'92\
\'91Ah,\'92 said Sam, \'91I do; and I remember more too. I don\'92t like my thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo\'92s stories and all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Ever since the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien would throw him off the scent again. The miserable creatu
\f0 re must have been hiding in the woods by the Silverlode, watching us start off!\'92\
\'91That\'92s about it,\'92 said Sam. \'91And we\'92d better be a bit more watchful ourselves, or we\'92ll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that\'92s what I was leading up to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight. I\'92ll keep watch. I can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.\'92\
\
500 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91I might,\'92 said Frodo, \'91and I might say \'91\'91luggage with eyes\'92\'92. You shall watch; but only if you promise to wake me half-way towards morning, if nothing happens before then.\'92\
In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him. \'91It\'92s a shame to wake you,\'92 whispered Sam, \'91but that\'92s what you said. There\'92s nothing to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night.\'92\
He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off his sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up.\
\'91What is it?\'92 he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. \'91I felt something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword?\'92\
\'91Gollum,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91Or at least, so I guess.\'92\
\'91Ah!\'92 said Aragorn. \'91So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we took to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he is too clever a waterman.\
\'91We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I will keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish\
\
the great river 501\
I could lay my hands on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to try and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.\'92\
The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and cunning. At Aragorn\'92s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time passed without event until the seventh day.\
The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes. Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.\
The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near to the grey hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march of Wilderland.\
There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock- chimneys, and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the\
\
502 the fellowship of the ring\
sun was setting, and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.\
\'91What is that, Legolas?\'92 he asked, pointing to the northern sky. \'91Is it, as I think, an eagle?\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Legolas. \'91It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.\'92\
\'91We will not start until it is fully dark,\'92 said Aragorn.\
The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the grey east wind had passed away. The thin cres- cent of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in the West stars glinted bright.\
\'91Come!\'92 said Aragorn. \'91We will venture one more journey by night. We are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well; for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and stony eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly.\'92\
To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watch- man. He lay forward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but the stars above were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer on the face of the River. It was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all huddled together.\
\
the great river 503\
\'91Hoy there, Aragorn!\'92 shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the leader. \'91This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.\'92\
\'91Back, back!\'92 cried Aragorn. \'91Turn! Turn if you can!\'92 He drove his paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round.\
\'91I am out of my reckoning,\'92 he said to Frodo. \'91I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.\'92\
With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current, and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank. Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night.\
\'91All together, paddle!\'92 shouted Boromir. \'91Paddle! Or we shall be driven on the shoals.\'92 Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone.\
At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through Aragorn\'92s hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by Merry\'92s hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle-banks that lay under the eastern shore. They seemed very near.\
\'91Yrch!\'92 said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.\
\'91Orcs!\'92 cried Gimli.\
\'91Gollum\'92s doing, I\'92ll be bound,\'92 said Sam to Frodo. \'91And\
a nice place to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into their arms!\'92\
They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead or struck the\
\
504 the fellowship of the ring\
water nearby; but there were no more hits. It was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Orcs, and in the star- glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless 
\f1 it was that the grey cloaks of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien and the grey timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. At last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks. Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore. Under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew breath.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien. Then he s
\f0 prang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the River into the darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but nothing could be seen.\
Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company.\
\'91Elbereth Gilthoniel!\'92 sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart; there was a\
\
the great river 505\
deadly cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide.\

\f1 Suddenly the great bow of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the elven-string. Fro
\f0 do looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved. There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night.\
After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way along the water\'92s edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it was useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together.\
\'91Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas!\'92 said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. \'91That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!\'92\
\'91But who can say what it hit?\'92 said Legolas.\
\'91I cannot,\'92 said Gimli. \'91But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria \'96 the shadow of the Balrog,\'92 he ended in a whisper.\
\'91It was not a Balrog,\'92 said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that had come upon him. \'91It was something colder. I think it was\'97\'97\'92 Then he paused and fell silent.\
\'91What do you think?\'92 asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo\'92s face.\
\'91I think\'97No, I will not say,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91Whatever it was, its fall has dismayed our enemies.\'92\
\'91So it seems,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Yet where they are, and how many, and what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But what\
\
506 the fellowship of the ring\
the day will show who can tell? Have your weapons close to\
hand!\'92\
Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers, and looking up at the sky. \'91It\'92s very strange,\'92 he murmured. \'91The Moon\'92s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be. But either it\'92s out of its running, or I\'92m all wrong in my reckoning. You\'92ll remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week from the full, I reckon. And we\'92d been a week on the way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country.\
\'91Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to remember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month. Anyone would think that time did not count in there!\'92\
\'91And perhaps that was the way of it,\'92 said Frodo. \'91In that land, maybe, we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was not, I think, until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don\'92t remember any moon, either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.\'92\
Legolas stirred in his boat. \'91Nay, time does not tarry ever,\'92 he said; \'91but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them. Slow, because they need not count the running years, not for themselves. The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.\'92\

\f1 \'91But the wearing is slow in Lo\uc0\u32 \u769  rien,\'92 said Frodo. \'91The power of the Lady is on it. Rich are the h
\f0 ours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven- ring.\'92\
\
the great river 507\

\f1 \'91That should not have been said outside Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien, not even to me,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost y
\f0 our count. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves. The old moon passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. Time flows on to a spring of little hope.\'92\
The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather. The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of the trees above them began to drip.\
When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen.\
\'91I can\'92t abide fog,\'92 said Sam; \'91but this seems to be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.\'92\
\'91Perhaps so,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.\'92\
\'91I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further,\'92 said Boromir. \'91If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon these cockle-boats, and strike west- ward and southward, until we come to the Entwash and cross into my own land.\'92\
\'91We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,\'92 said Aragorn, \'91but that is not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds. The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is at least a path that cannot be missed.\'92\
\
508 the fellowship of the ring\
\'91But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,\'92 objected Boromir. \'91And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes?\'92\
\'91No!\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again. Do you not know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.\'92\
Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. \'91It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,\'92 he said, \'91and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home, alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.\'92\
The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore, while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids.\
\'91Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,\'92 he said, \'91but that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply.\'92\
\
the great river 509\
\'91Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Orcs prowl on the east-shore,\'92 said Boromir. \'91If you go for- ward, peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path.\'92\
\'91Peril lies ahead on every southward road,\'92 answered Aragorn. \'91Wait for us one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can.\'92\
It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again.\
\'91All is well,\'92 said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. \'91There is a track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I fear we must leave the River now, and make for the portage- way as best we can from here.\'92\
\'91That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,\'92 said Boromir.\
\'91Yet such as we are we will try it,\'92 said Aragorn.\
\'91Aye, we will,\'92 said Gimli. \'91The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir!\'92\
The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They were\
\
510 the fellowship of the ring\
far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the Elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat. Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland.\
One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all was removed and laid on the portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing.\
There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage for those on foot.\
Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day.\
\'91Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,\'92 said Boromir. \'91We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too tired \'96 except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.\'92\
\
the great river 511\
Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.\
\'91Let us rest as much as we can now,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91Tomorrow we must journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off and one on guard.\'92\
Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was thinning. They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew down lower, and it began to rain heavily. They drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on; little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains.\
The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen.\
Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared between them, and the River swept the boats towards it.\
\'91Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!\'92 cried Aragorn. \'91We shall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line,\
\
512 the fellowship of the ring\
and as far apart as you can! Hold the middle of the stream!\'92 As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still wore, the silent wardens of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not d
\f1 aring to look up as the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by, frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769  menor. So they passed into the\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 dark chasm of the Gates.\
Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either\
side. Far off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning: \'91What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of this boat, and I\'92ll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river!\'92\
\'91Fear not!\'92 said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw Strider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to his own land.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f1 \cf0 \'91Fear not!\'92 he said. \'91Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Ana\uc0\u32 \u769 rion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf0 \
the great river 513\
of Valandil Isildur\'92s son, heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!\'92 Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: \'91Would that Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my own city! But whither now\
shall I go?\'92\
The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of\
wind and rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot through, out into a wide clear light.\
The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away.\
\'91Behold Tol Brandir!\'92 said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. \'91Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen, the Hills of Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.\'92\
The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great\
\
514 the fellowship of the ring\
voice. Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills.\
The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. They could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west. The last stage of the Quest was before them.\
\
Chapter 10\
THE BREAKING OF THE FELLOWSHIP\
Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.\
\'91Here we will rest tonight,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91This is the lawn of Parth Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope that no evil has yet come here.\'92\
They drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made their camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn it was to watch.\
\'91Why are you waking?\'92 asked Frodo. \'91It is not your watch.\'92\
\'91I do not know,\'92 answered Aragorn; \'91but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.\'92\
\'91Why?\'92 said Frodo. \'91Are enemies at hand?\'92\
\'91Let us see what Sting may show,\'92 answered Aragorn. Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dis-\
may the edges gleamed dimly in the night. \'91Orcs!\'92 he said. \'91Not very near, and yet too near, it seems.\'92\
\'91I feared as much,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But maybe they are not on this side of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard before of Orcs\
\
516 the fellowship of the ring\
upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.\'92\
The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water. High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be seen.\
When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. \'91The day has come at last,\'92 he said: \'91the day of choice which we have long delayed. What shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water.\'92\
There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.\
\'91Well, Frodo,\'92 said Aragorn at last. \'91I fear that the burden is laid upon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Coun- cil. Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.\'92\
Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. \'91I know that haste is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 517\
is heavy. Give me an hour longer, and I will speak. Let me be alone!\'92\
Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. \'91Very well, Frodo son of Drogo,\'92 he said. \'91You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.\'92\
Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: \'91Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it\'92s no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.\'92\
Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen.\
Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.\
He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of Gandalf \'92s words. Time went on, and still he was no nearer to a choice.\
Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up and turned; but all that\
\
518 the fellowship of the ring\
he saw to his surprise was Boromir, and his face was smiling and kind.\
\'91I was afraid for you, Frodo,\'92 he said, coming forward. \'91If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.\'92\
\'91You are kind,\'92 answered Frodo. \'91But I do not think that any speech will help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it, Boromir: afraid.\'92\
Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered. Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. \'91Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly?\'92 he said. \'91I wish to help you. You need counsel in your hard choice. Will you not take mine?\'92 \'91I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,\'92 said Frodo. \'91And it would seem like wisdom but\
for the warning of my heart.\'92\
\'91Warning? Warning against what?\'92 said Boromir sharply. \'91Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against\
refusal of the burden that is laid on me. Against \'96 well, if it must be said, against trust in the strength and truth of Men.\'92 \'91Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your\
little country, though you knew it not.\'92\
\'91I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is\
changing. The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If they fail, what then?\'92\
\'91We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they will not fail.\'92\
\'91No hope while the Ring lasts,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91Ah! The Ring!\'92 said Boromir, his eyes lighting. \'91The Ring! Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the house of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again?\'92\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 519\
Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange gleam in Boromir\'92s eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. \'91It is best that it should lie hidden,\'92 he answered.\
\'91As you wish. I care not,\'92 said Boromir. \'91Yet may I not even speak of it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us?\'92\
\'91Were you not at the Council?\'92 answered Frodo. \'91Because we cannot use it, and what is done with it turns to evil.\'92\
Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. \'91So you go on,\'92 he cried. \'91Gandalf, Elrond \'96 all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves they may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not desire the power of wizard- lords, only strength to defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these alone will achieve vic- tory. What could not a warrior do in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!\'92\
Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly. Almost he seemed to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms.\
\'91And they tell us to throw it away!\'92 he cried. \'91I do not say\
\
520 the fellowship of the ring\
destroy it. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself. Folly!\
\'91Surely you see it, my friend?\'92 he said, turning now sud- denly to Frodo again. \'91You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?\'92\
\'91No, I am afraid,\'92 said Frodo. \'91Simply afraid. But I am glad to have heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.\'92\
\'91Then you will come to Minas Tirith?\'92 cried Boromir. His eyes were shining and his face eager.\
\'91You misunderstand me,\'92 said Frodo.\
\'91But you will come, at least for a while?\'92 Boromir persisted. \'91My city is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,\'92 he said. \'91You need rest before your venture, if go you must.\'92 He laid his hand on the hobbit\'92s shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength.\
\'91Why are you so unfriendly?\'92 said Boromir. \'91I am a true man, neither thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring!\'92\
\'91No! no!\'92 cried Frodo. \'91The Council laid it upon me to bear it.\'92\
\'91It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defea
\f1 t us,\'92 cried Boromir. \'91How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might have been
\f0  mine. It should be mine. Give it to me!\'92\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 521\
Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them. \'91Come, come, my friend!\'92 said Boromir in a softer voice. \'91Why not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,\'92 he cried; and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes.\
Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking here and there among the rocks and trees.\
\'91Miserable trickster!\'92 he shouted. \'91Let me get my hands on you! Now I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all halflings to death and dark- ness!\'92 Then, catching his foot on a stone, he fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept.\
He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. \'91What have I said?\'92 he cried. \'91What have I done? Frodo, Frodo!\'92 he called. \'91Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back!\'92\
There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his burning eyes.\
Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like\
\
522 the fellowship of the ring\
a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain- kings.\
At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and yet re
\f1 mote. There was no sound, only bright living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Nu\uc0\u32 \u769 menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless
\f0  plains, and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.\
But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were 
\f1 issuing out of a thousand holes. Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of Lo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien.\

\f0 Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 523\
battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul, and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Dark- ness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, and a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-du\'88 r, Fortress of Sauron. All hope left him.\
And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir \'96 he threw himself from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.\
He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I come to you? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!\
The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points, he writhed, tor- mented. Suddenly he was aware of himself again, Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree.\
Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to\
\
524 the fellowship of the ring\
himself. \'91I will do now what I must,\'92 he said. \'91This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen into evil. I will go alone. At once.\'92\
He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below.\
\'91They\'92ll be hunting for me,\'92 he said. \'91I wonder how long I have been away. Hours, I should think.\'92 He hesitated. \'91What can I do?\'92 he muttered. \'91I must go now or I shall never go. I shan\'92t get a chance again. I hate leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?\'92\
Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind.\
The others remained long by the river-side. For some time they had been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why was he hesitating?\
\'91He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company to go east, since we have been tracked\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 525\
by Gollum, and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire and the destruction of the Burden.\
\'91We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any of us choose in Frodo\'92s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.\'92\
\'91Grievous is our loss,\'92 said Legolas. \'91Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.\'92\
\'91And so should I,\'92 said Gimli. \'91We, of course, were only sent to help the Bearer along the road, to go no f
\f1 urther than we wished; and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting from Lothlo\uc0\u32 \u769 rien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would 
\f0 choose Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.\'92\
\'91And I too will go with him,\'92 said Legolas. \'91It would be faithless now to say farewell.\'92\
\'91It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three com- panions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. Boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing to leave us.\'92\
\'91That won\'92t do at all!\'92 cried Merry. \'91We can\'92t leave Frodo! Pippin and I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not realize what that would mean. It\
\
526 the fellowship of the ring\
seemed different so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why can\'92t we stop him?\'92\
\'91We must stop him,\'92 said Pippin. \'91And that is what he is worrying about, I am sure. He knows we shan\'92t agree to his going east. And he doesn\'92t like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to Mordor alone!\'92 Pippin shuddered. \'91But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to know that he hasn\'92t got to ask. He ought to know that if we can\'92t stop him, we shan\'92t leave him.\'92\
\'91Begging your pardon,\'92 said Sam. \'91I don\'92t think you under- stand my master at all. He isn\'92t hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! What\'92s the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,\'92 he added, and turned. It was then that they dis- covered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, was no longer there.\
\'91Now where\'92s he got to?\'92 cried Sam, looking worried. \'91He\'92s been a bit queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he\'92s not in this business. He\'92s off to his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows he\'92s got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he\'92s afraid. Now it\'92s come to the point, he\'92s just plain terrified. That\'92s what his trouble is. Of course he\'92s had a bit of schooling, so to speak \'96 we all have \'96 since we left home, or he\'92d be so terrified he\'92d just fling the Ring in the River and bolt. But he\'92s still too frightened to start. And he isn\'92t worrying about us either: whether we\'92ll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That\'92s another thing that\'92s bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he\'92ll want to go alone. Mark my words! We\'92re going to have trouble when he comes back. For he\'92ll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name\'92s Baggins.\'92\
\'91I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91And what shall we do, if you prove right?\'92\
\'91Stop him! Don\'92t let him go!\'92 cried Pippin.\
\'91I wonder?\'92 said Aragorn. \'91He is the Bearer, and the fate of the Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 527\
drive him one way or the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are other powers at work far stronger.\'92\
\'91Well, I wish Frodo would \'91\'91screw himself up\'92\'92 and come back, and let us get it over,\'92 said Pippin. \'91This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up?\'92\
\'91Yes,\'92 said Aragorn. \'91The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing away. We must call for him.\'92\
At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground.\
\'91Where have you been, Boromir?\'92 asked Aragorn. \'91Have you seen Frodo?\'92\
Boromir hesitated for a second. \'91Yes, and no,\'92 he answered slowly. \'91Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I thought he would return to you.\'92\
\'91Is that all that you have to say?\'92 said Aragorn, looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir.\
\'91Yes,\'92 he answered. \'91I will say no more yet.\'92\
\'91This is bad!\'92 cried Sam, jumping up. \'91I don\'92t know what this Man has been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn\'92t ought to have; and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!\'92\
\'91But he wouldn\'92t keep it on,\'92 said Merry. \'91Not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.\'92\
\'91But where did he go? Where is he?\'92 cried Pippin. \'91He\'92s been away ages now.\'92\
\'91How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir?\'92 asked Aragorn.\
\'91Half an hour, maybe,\'92 he answered. \'91Or it might be an\
\
528 the fellowship of the ring\
hour. I have wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know!\'92 He put his head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief.\
\'91An hour since he vanished!\'92 shouted Sam. \'91We must try and find him at once. Come on!\'92\
\'91Wait a moment!\'92 cried Aragorn. \'91We must divide up into pairs, and arrange \'96 here, hold on! Wait!\'92\
It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! in their clear, high, hobbit-voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the Company.\
\'91We shall all be scattered and lost,\'92 groaned Aragorn. \'91Boro- mir! I do not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I shall return soon.\'92\
Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans he over- took him, toiling uphill, panting and calling, Frodo!\
\'91Come with me, Sam!\'92 he said. \'91None of us should be alone. There is mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open!\'92 He sped up the path.\
Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head.\
\'91Whoa, Sam Gamgee!\'92 he said aloud. \'91Your legs are too short, so use your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn\'92t lying, that\'92s not his way; but he hasn\'92t told us everything. Some- thing scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last \'96 to go. Where\
\
the breaking of the fellowship 529\
to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That\'92s hard, cruel hard.\'92\
Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. \'91Steady, Gamgee!\'92 he said. \'91Think, if you can! He can\'92t fly across rivers, and he can\'92t jump waterfalls. He\'92s got no gear. So he\'92s got to get back to the boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning!\'92\
Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat slipped into the water.\
\'91Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming!\'92 called Sam, and flung him- self from the bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went under, and the River closed over his curly head.\
An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.\
\'91Up you come, Sam my lad!\'92 said Frodo. \'91Now take my hand!\'92\
\'91Save me, Mr. Frodo!\'92 gasped Sam. \'91I\'92m drownded. I can\'92t see your hand.\'92\
\'91Here it is. Don\'92t pinch, lad! I won\'92t let you go. Tread water and don\'92t flounder, or you\'92ll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side, and let me use the paddle!\'92\
With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and stepped ashore again.\
\'91Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam!\'92 he said.\
\'91Oh, Mr. Frodo, that\'92s hard!\'92 said Sam shivering. \'91That\'92s\
\
530 the fellowship of the ring\
hard, trying to go without me and all. If I hadn\'92t a guessed right, where would you be now?\'92\
\'91Safely on my way.\'92\
\'91Safely!\'92 said Sam. \'91All alone and without me to help you? I couldn\'92t have a borne it, it\'92d have been the death of me.\'92\
\'91It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,\'92 said Frodo, \'91and I could not have borne that.\'92\
\'91Not as certain as being left behind,\'92 said Sam.\
\'91But I am going to Mordor.\'92\
\'91I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are.\
And I\'92m coming with you.\'92\
\'91Now, Sam,\'92 said Frodo, \'91don\'92t hinder me! The others will\
be coming back at any minute. If they catch me here, I shall have to argue and explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I must go at once. It\'92s the only way.\'92\
\'91Of course it is,\'92 answered Sam. \'91But not alone. I\'92m coming too, or neither of us isn\'92t going. I\'92ll knock holes in all the boats first.\'92\
Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. \'91Leave one!\'92 he said. \'91We\'92ll need it. But you can\'92t come like this without your gear or food or anything.\'92\
\'91Just hold on a moment, and I\'92ll get my stuff!\'92 cried Sam eagerly. \'91It\'92s all ready. I thought we should be off today.\'92 He rushed to the camping place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companions\'92 goods, grabbed a spare blanket, and some extra packages of food, and ran back.\
\'91So all my plan is spoilt!\'92 said Frodo. \'91It is no good trying to escape you. But I\'92m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don\'92t suppose we shall see them again.\'92\
\'91Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may,\'92 said Sam.\
So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo paddled away from the shore, and the River

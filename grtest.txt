\f0\fs28 \cf2 \'93My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\'94 Royce replied. \'93Never believe anything you hear at a woman\'92s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\'94 His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit f

\'93We have a long ride before us,\'94 Gared pointed out. \'93Eight days, maybe nine. And night is fa

Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \'93It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark,
\f1\fs24  
\f0\fs28 Gared?\'94 \
Will could see the tightness around Gared\'92s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night\'92s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close
\f1\fs24  
\f0\fs28 to fear. \
Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred r

\f0\fs28 ngings by \
now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terro
\f1\fs24 r
\f0\fs28 s for him. \
Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with you

Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night\'92s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe 
\f1\fs24 w
\f0\fs28 as concerned. \
His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \'93Bet he killed them all himself, he did,\'94 Gared told the barracks over wine, \'93twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\'94 They had all sh
\f1\fs24 a
\f0\fs28 red the laugh. \
It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must hav

\f0\fs28  felt the same. \

2 EXT. NOBLES' HOUSE - DAY 1 2\
Fast, cheeky music, sc.2-13.\
DONNA steps out of her front door. Smart, head held high;\
she's on a mission. And as Donna heads left to right -\
CUT TO:\

Sets off. On a mission.\

London HQ of Adipose Industries.\
Deep breath, Donna heads towards it.\
CUT TO:\
7 EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES - DAY 1 7\
THE DOCTOR stops in the street, looks up...\

9 EXT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES, BACK YARD - DAY 1 9\
THE DOCTOR's down a flight of steps, sonicking a basement\

CUT TO:\
10 INT. ADIPOSE INDUSTRIES, FOYER - DAY 1 10\
Posh foyer. DONNA shows her ID pass to the SECURITY GUARD.\

Two lift doors, next to each other. DONNA gets into the\
left-hand lift, heading up, doors close. At the same time -\
The doors on the right-hand lift open - it's come up from\
the basement - and THE DOCTOR steps out, heads off, curious.\
CUT TO:\
13 INT. CINEMA - DAY 1 13\
Part of the Tower Block HQ, with Adipose Industries logos\
on the walls. Slogan: The Fat Just Walks Away.\
The logo is on screen, as MISS FOSTER steps forward, at\
the front. She's 40s, handsome, strong. She addresses\
the audience, 40 PEOPLE or so, scattered about, taking\
notes - they're JOURNALISTS; this is a Press Launch.\
MISS FOSTER\
Adipose Industries. The twentyfirst century way to lose weight.\
No exercise, no diet, no pain.\
Just lifelong freedom, from fat,\
the Holy Grail of the modern age.\
And here it is!\
Holds it up, an ordinary red & white capsule.\
MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)\
You just take one capsule.\

13 CONTINUED: 13\
MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)\
One capsule, once a day, for three\
weeks. And the fat, as they say...\
ON SCREEN, GRAPHIC, the logo does a little spin, the jingle\
sings: The Fat Just Walks Awaaaaay!\
CUT TO DONNA, in amongst the audience, as a WOMAN near to\
her pipes up - PENNY CARTER, late 20's, sharp.\
PENNY\
Excuse me, Miss Foster, if I\
could..? I'm Penny Carter, Science\
Correspondent for the Observer\
MISS FOSTER\
Oh yes. You've written quite a\
bit about us already.\
PENNY\
And I'm not about to stop. But\
there's a thousand diet pills on\
the market, and a thousand conmen\
stealing people's money. How do\
we know the fat isn't going straight\
into your bank account?\
MISS FOSTER\
Penny. If cynicism burnt up\
calories, we'd all be thin as rakes.\
But if you want the science, then\
I can oblige...\
She nods up to the PROJECTION BOOTH.\
The projected beam of light flickers, changes.\
The next reel starts up, GRAPHICS showing a pill, and a\
layout of the Human body, with arrows going from the pill,\
to the body, then flowing round the bloodstream.\
VOICEOVER\
The Adipose Capsule is composed of\
a synthesised mobilising lipase,\
bound to a large protein molecule.\
The mobilising lipase breaks up\
the triglycerides stored in the\
adipose cells, which then enter\
the bloodstream... [etc.]\
But during this, on Donna, watching, suspicious. And then\
PAN UP to see behind her, THE DOCTOR, in the PROJECTION\
BOOTH WINDOW. (Not seeing Donna, just watching the screen.)\
CUT TO INT. PROJECTION BOOTH, THE DOCTOR at the window, a\
FILM PROJECTOR whirring away, manned by a BLOKE. The Doctor\
shows him the psychic paper, keeping his eye on Miss Foster.\

THE DOCTOR\
Health and Safety. Film department.\
CUT TO CINEMA, film over, logo back on screen, as MISS\
FOSTER steps forward again. CUT BETWEEN THE DOCTOR & DONNA\
watching, separately.\
MISS FOSTER\
100% legal, 100% effective.\
PENNY\
But can I ask, how many people\
have taken the pills, to date?\
MISS FOSTER\
We've already got one million\
customers within the Greater London\
area alone. But from next week,\
we start rolling out, nationwide.\
The future starts here. And Britain\
will be thin!\
CUT TO:\
14 INT. SALES CUBICLES - DAY 1 14\
The sales floor. Divided into those American-style\
cubicles, as functional as possible, like Keanu Reeves's\
office in The Matrix. Just a desk, a computer, a phone.\
TRACKING along, passing one SALESPERSON after another, all\
on headsets, all cold-calling the spiel. 'Good morning, I\
represent Adipose Industries...' 'Good morning, I represent\
Adipose Industries...' 'Good morning, I represent...' etc.\
TRACKING TO FIND DONNA, walking in - on edge, cautious,\
armed with a clipboard - she grabs a spare chair, pulls it\
over to a CUBICLE, where CRAIG, 20, is at work, on headset.\
DONNA\
Donna Noble, Health\
and Safety, don't\
mind me.\
CRAIG\
That's a three week course\
of pills for the special\
price of 45 pounds...\
CUT TO the opposite side of the room, THE DOCTOR entering -\
cautious, on edge - he grabs a spare chair, slides it across\
to CLAIRE'S cubicle. She's 20, on headset.\
THE DOCTOR\
John Smith, Health\
and Safety, don't\
mind me.\
CLAIRE\
...we can deliver within\
three working days,\
registered post...\
CUT TO Donna & Craig. He's on his headset, with the spiel;\
he's got a script, and a sample Adipose Industries box at\
his side - a small white cardboard box, full of 21 pills\
in packets, information leaflets, etc.\

14 CONTINUED: 14\
CRAIG\
...the box comes with 21 days'\
worth of pills, a full information\
pack, and our special free gift,\
an Adipose Industries pendant...\
But Donna's taking the pendant out of the box. Simple\
gold chain with a gold representation of an Adipose capsule.\
CUT TO the Doctor & Claire.\
CLAIRE\
...it's made of 18 carat gold, and\
it's yours for free... No, we\
don't give away pens. Sorry. No,\
I can't make an exception, no.\
He's already taken the pendant, holds it up, examines it.\
CU on the gold Adipose capsule.\
CUT TO Donna & Craig. He's now taking off his headset, to\
look at her properly, as she puts the pendant in her pocket.\
DONNA\
I'll just keep this for testing.\
And I just need a list of your\
customers, can you print it off?\
CRAIG\
S'pose so.\
DONNA\
Where's the printer..?\
CRAIG\
Just over there, by the door.\
WIDE SHOT, as she pops her head up over the partition.\
The only face visible among the rows of cubicles.\
DONNA\
Which door, that door?\
CRAIG OOV\
That's the one.\
DONNA\
Lovely.\
She pops back down, gone - and in that second -\
- THE DOCTOR pops his head up, far across the room.\
THE DOCTOR\
And that's the printer, over there?\
CLAIRE OOV\
By the door, yeah.\

14 CONTINUED: (2) 14\
THE DOCTOR\
Brilliant!\
And he pops back down -\
- as Donna pops back up, looking towards the printer.\
DONNA\
Does it need a code? Last place I\
worked, the printer needed a code.\
CRAIG OOV\
No, I can do that from here.\
And she pops back down -\
- as the Doctor pops back up, looking round.\
THE DOCTOR\
Has it got paper?\
CLAIRE OOV\
Yeah, Jimbo keeps it stocked.\
But the Doctor gives an 'oops!' and ducks down, seeing -\
MISS FOSTER striding in. With 2 SECURITY GUARDS, her\
permanent escort. She goes to the centre, claps her hands.\
MISS FOSTER\
Everyone! Excuse me! If I could\
have your attention!\
Heads pop up all around the cubicles, some standing, some\
just with eyes over the partitions. Donna stands up...\
As the Doctor slowly stands up...\
Miss Foster takes a single step forward, just in time to\
completely mask the Doctor from Donna's POV, and vice versa.\
MISS FOSTER (CONT'D)\
On average, you're each selling\
forty Adipose packs per day. It's\
not enough! I want one hundred\
sales, per person, per day, and if\
not, you'll be replaced. Cos if\
anyone's good at trimming the fat,\
it's me. Now back to it!\
All heads duck down, Donna sinking back down as -\
Miss Foster clears Donna's previous POV, revealing the\
Doctor, just ducking back down into the cubicle. To Claire:\
THE DOCTOR\
Anyway! If you could just print\
that off, thanks.\

DONNA\
Print off the list, and I'll get\
out of your way.\
CU CURSOR clicking on PRINT.\
CUT TO PRINTER, churning out PAPERS. Yellow sheets.\
DONNA (CONT'D)\
Lovely, thanks, see you.\
WIDE SHOT, as she stands, hurries over to the printer -\
The Doctor pops up for a micro-second, about to go -\
THE DOCTOR\
Thanks then -\
- before he can look in Donna's direction, he's pulled\
back down again! By Claire, holding out a piece of paper.\
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\
What's that?\
CLAIRE\
My telephone number.\
THE DOCTOR\
...what for?\
CLAIRE\
(foxy)\
Health and Safety. You be health.\
I'll be safety.\
CUT TO Donna, at the printer. She grabs all the papers,\
heads for the door -\
And as she swings it open, foreground, and disappears\
through the door - in background, the Doctor stands -\
THE DOCTOR\
...that contravenes paragraph 5\
subsection C, sorry, thanks, bye -\
And he hurries away, going across to the printer.\
No papers, nothing. Eh?! He lifts the photocopier lid,\
checks all round, no sign of them. Damn.\
CUT TO CLAIRE, as the Doctor reappears. Big smile.\
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\

STACY CAMPBELL, 20s, bit plump - harassed, running late -\

DONNA's standing there, with clipboard & yellow papers,\
just flashes her ID card so it can't be seen properly.\
DONNA\
Stacy Campbell?\
STACY\
Who wants to know?\
DONNA\
My name's Donna, I represent Adipose\
Industries, and you're on the list\
of our valued customers - I wonder,\
could I ask you a few questions?\
STACY\
Sorry, I'm going out, I've booked\
a taxi, it's on its way.\
DONNA\
Tell you what, answer the questions\
and I'll get the taxi with you,\
then I can pay for it on expenses,\
how does that sound?\
STACY\
Um. Brilliant, yeah. Okay! I'm\
still getting ready though, I'm in\
a bit of a rush -\
DONNA\
You just carry on, don't mind me!\
And Donna heads inside -\

THE DOCTOR\
Mr Roger Davey! I'm calling on\
behalf of Adipose Industries, I\
just need to ask you a few questions -\
ROGER\
Oh, brilliant, come in, those pills,\
they've been like magic! If you\

hair's pinned up. DONNA sitting there with clipboard.\
STACY\
- it's been fantastic, I started\
the pills on Thursday, five days\
later, I've lost eleven pounds!\
DONNA\
And no side effects or anything?\
STACY\
No, I feel fantastic, it's a new\
lease of life - what d'you think\
about the earings, do they work?\
DONNA\
Lovely, yeah. Going on a date?\
STACY\
I'm doing the opposite, I'm gonna\
dump him! I can do better than\
him now! What d'you think, hair\
up or down? No, down, I want him\
to see me looking gorgeous -\
(hurrying upstairs)\
- won't be long, if the taxi beeps,\
give me a shout -\
She's gone. On Donna, wondering if she's wasting her time.\
CUT TO:\
18 INT. ROGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 1 18\
ROGER sitting, THE DOCTOR prowling round the room.\
ROGER\
I've been on the pills for two\
weeks now, I've lost 14 kilos!\
THE DOCTOR\
That's the same amount every day?\
ROGER\
One kilo, exactly. You wake up,\
and it's disappeared overnight.\
Well, technically speaking, it's\
gone by ten past one in the morning.\
THE DOCTOR\

the burglar alarm goes off.\
CUT TO:\
19 EXT. ROGER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 1 19\
THE DOCTOR & ROGER looking up at Roger's burglar-alarm\
box, high on the wall above the front door.\
ROGER\
I've had experts in, I've had it\
replaced, I've even phoned Watchdog,\
you name it. But no! Ten past\
one in the morning, off it goes.\
THE DOCTOR\
But with no burglars?\
ROGER\
Nothing! I've given up looking!\
THE DOCTOR\
Tell me, Roger... have you got a\
cat flap?\
CUT TO:\
20 INT. ROGER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 1 20\
THE DOCTOR on the floor, prodding the back door's cat flap\
with the sonic. The flap swings to and fro, harmless.\
ROGER kneeling beside him, fascinated.\
ROGER\
It was here when I bought the house.\
Never bothered with it, really,\
I'm not a cat person.\
THE DOCTOR\
No, I've met cat people, you're\
nothing like them.\
ROGER\
Is that what it is, though? Cats,\
getting inside the house?\
THE DOCTOR\
Well, that's the thing about cat\
flaps. They don't just let things\
in. They let things out as well.\
ROGER\
Like what..?\

SCENE CONTINUES, INTERCUT WITH LIVING ROOM -\
CUT TO:\
22 INT. STACY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 1 22\
DONNA\
That's all right!\
She sits, fiddling with the GOLD PENDANT. Just out of\
boredom. She holds it up, in the light. Nothing special.\
Then she just holds it normally, looking round the room.\
CU Donna's hands as, without thinking, she starts to unscrew\
the two halves of the gold capsule...\
CUT TO THE BATHROOM. Stacy gasps. Not pain, but a sudden\
feeling in her stomach. She clutches it.\
CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna stops fiddling with the capsule.\
CUT TO BATHROOM, the sensation's gone, Stacy recovers,\
holds her stomach. What the hell was that..?\
CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna starts to fiddle again, unscrewing\
the capsule...\
CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy feels something again, holds her\
stomach. What's happening..?\
CUT TO LIVING ROOM, Donna still screwing & unscrewing the\
two halves, without even looking at what she's doing.\
CUT TO BATHROOM, Stacy lifts up her top. Smooths the skin\
of her stomach. Then horrified, as...\
FX: the skin on her stomach moves. Like something is\
writhing underneath. Pushing the skin out...\
She's not in pain, just scared, as she looks in the mirror.\
FX: her stomach keeps moving, just one central area, like\
a little fat mole is buried underneath, trying to get out.\

BATHROOM, CU STACY boggling, looking down, as...\
FX: STACY'S skin stretches out - and nothing is actually\
breaking through, no broken skin, no blood - instead, the\
stretching skin is whitening and smoothly dividing off\
into a separate entity, like amoebas separating...\
FX: and the lump plops free! With Stacy standing by the\
sink, it just drops down into the bowl, and her stomach\
just twangs back to normal. And the lump is...\
FX: an ADIPOSE, standing in the sink-bowl. About the size\
of a bag of sugar. And almost the same shape. A white\
lump of fat, Pilsbury Dough Boy in texture, with rudimentary\
arms and legs, black-dot eyes, a mewling mouth, with one\
little fang. It's strangely sort of cute. Like a soft\
toy. It seems to be waving, little stumpy arms, at Stacy.\
Stacy is just boggling.\
LIVING ROOM, Donna goes to the hallway door, calls up:\
DONNA\
You all right up there?\
BATHROOM, Stacy stunned, too embarrassed to call for help.\
STACY\
...yeah.\

DONNA (CONT'D)\
Have you lived here long? Stacy?\
You all right?\
FX: BATHROOM, 2 ADIPOSE now in the sink, waving. Whispered:\
STACY\
What are you? What are you?\
But then - oh God - more movement - under her t-shirt,\
more shapes, lots, shifting, her stomach, at her shoulder,\
on her back, on her thigh, writhing under her clothes.\

DONNA\
Wouldn't mind a little visit myself.\
Everything okay in there?\

separate pieces - twenty separate ADIPOSE, plop!, tumbling\
to the floor, in amongst her falling, empty clothes -\
FX: on the FLOOR, in amongst the fallen clothes, a NUMBER\
OF ADIPOSE waddle about, heading for the walls, with one\
still emerging from the clothes.\
Donna hears something, stops shoving, listens...\
A tiny giggling, a scurrying noise, from the bathroom.\
Donna shoves again, shoves hard -\
CU on the bolt, flying off, the door flies open - !\
Donna in the doorway, stares.\
Her POV: Stacy's clothes on the floor. Then looking up...\

You might as well have a scoop.\

This... is the spark of life.\
PENNY\
What's that supposed to mean?\
MISS FOSTER\
Officially, the capsule attracts\
all the fat cells, and then flushes\
them away. Well, it certainly\
attracts them, that part's true.\
But it binds the fat together, and\
galvanises it, to form a body.\
PENNY\

The Doctor & Donna smiling.\
DONNA\
What you gonna do, then? Blow\

THE DOCTOR\
They're just children. Can't help\

Makes a change from last time.\

She did. Yeah, she did.\

Matron Cofelia, listen to me - !\
MID-SHOT, Miss Foster stops, suspended in the air (IE, NONFX, shot against night sky; she's haloed and backlit by\
PRAC LIGHT). Calling across the night:\
MISS FOSTER\
I don't think so, Doctor. And if\
I never see you again, it'll be -\
THE DOCTOR\
- oh why does no one ever listen?!\
I'm trying to help! Just... get\
across to the roof, can you shift\
the levitation beam?\
MISS FOSTER\
What, so you can arrest me?\
THE DOCTOR\
Just listen!! I saw the Adiposian\
instructions! They know it's a\
crime, breeding on Earth, so what's\
the one thing they want to get rid\
of? Their accomplice!\
MISS FOSTER\
I'm far more than that, I'm nanny,\
to all these children.\
THE DOCTOR\
Exactly! Mum and Dad have got the\
kids, they don't need the nanny\
any more!\
MID-SHOT, on Miss Foster... as the LIGHT SNAPS OFF!\
Darkness. She looks left and right, held in the air for a\
second like a cartoon coyote. Then -\
FX: WIDE SHOT as Miss Foster falls, plummets, screaming,\

in the distance, there are signs of the disruption - POLICE\
BARRIERS, FLASHING LIGHTS. An AMBULANCE and PARAMEDICS\
closer to the building (hiding the remains of Miss Foster).\
The Doctor looks at the SONIC PEN, decides naah, chucks it\
away, gets out the SONIC SCREWDRIVER, jams it into his\
GIZMO, points the whole thing up -\
FX: a SMALL BLUE PULSE OF LIGHT flies up, into the sky...\
DONNA\
What's that?\
THE DOCTOR\
Sending a statement to the Shadow\
Proclamation. Reporting the\
Adiposian crime. Suppose the\
children will be taken into care.\
I hate being official, brrr.\
PENNY appears. Staggering. She is still tied to her chair,\
having to hold it behind her. Wild-eyed and furious:\
PENNY\
You two! You're just... mad!\
D'you hear me?? Mad! I'm gonna\
report you! For madness!\
She runs off towards the distant POLICE, like a lunatic.\

DONNA\
That's my car! That's like destiny!\
And I've been ready for this, I\
packed ages ago, just in case -\
And she's opening the boot, hauling out a suitcase, another,\
a carpet bag, a valise, a trolley-thing, two plastic bags -\
She shoves them at the Doctor, piling them up in his arms -\
DONNA (CONT'D)\
- cos I thought, hot weather, cold\
weather, no weather, he goes\
anywhere, I've gotta be prepared -\
THE DOCTOR\
You've got a hatbox.\
DONNA\

She swings the boot shut, slam - !\
JUMP CUT TO DONNA dumping her armfuls of stuff by the\
Tardis, THE DOCTOR standing back, still weighed down with\
luggage; so she's in the Tardis doorway, with him facing\
her, the opposite of the end of 3.X.\
DONNA (CONT'D)\
- I don't need injections, do I?\
Y'know, like when you go to\
Cambodia, is there any of that?\
Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain,\
and... you're not saying very much.\
THE DOCTOR\
No, but it's just... It's a funny\
old life, in the Tardis, it's not...\
DONNA\
(quiet, crestfallen)\
You don't want me.\

You just want TO MATE??!\

I just want A mate!\
DONNA\
You're not mating with me, sunshine!\
THE DOCTOR\
A mate, I want, a! Mate!\
DONNA\
Just as well! I'm not having any\

There we are, then. Okay!\

I can come?\

Yeah. Course you can, yeah.\

There now, d'you see - used the\
regeneration energy to heal myself,\
but as soon as that was done, I\
didn't need to change, I didn't\
want to, why would I?, look at me!\
So! To stop the energy going all\
the way, I siphoned off the rest\
into a handy bio-matching\
receptacle, namely, my hand, that\
hand there, my handy spare hand!\

Remember, Christmas Day, Sycorax,\
lost my hand in a swordfight?\

ROSE\

DONNA\
The stars were going out.\
ROSE\
One by one. We looked up at the\
sky. And they were dying. And at\

dimensions started to unravel.\
Cos we'd been building this travel\
machine, a Dimension Cannon, so I\
could... Well...\
THE DOCTOR\
(smiling)\
What?\
ROSE\
So I could come back.\
(he grins)\
Shut up. But all of a sudden, it\
started working. Cos the dimensions\
were starting to collapse. Not\
just our world, not just yours,\
but the whole of reality. Even\
the Void was dead. Something is\
destroying everything.\
DONNA\
But in that parallel world... You\
said something about me.\
ROSE\
The Dimension Cannon could measure\
the Time Lines. And it was weird,\
Donna. They all seemed to\
converge... On you.\

You told me, nothing could get\

CAPTAIN JACK\
You've got Extrapolator shielding!\
THE DOCTOR\
Last time we fought the Daleks,\
they were scavengers, and hybrids,\
and mad, but this is a fully-fledged\
Dalek Empire, at the height of its\
power, experts at fighting Tardises,\
they can do anything. Right now,\

THE DOCTOR\
But you've got to. Cos we saved\
the universe at a cost, and the\
cost, is him.\
(ie, Doctor #2)\
He destroyed the Daleks. He\
committed genocide. He's too\
dangerous to be left on his own.\
THE DOCTOR #2\
You made me.\
THE DOCTOR\
Exactly. You were born in battle.\
Full of blood and anger and revenge.\
(to Rose)\
Remind you of someone? That's me,\
when we first met. And you made\
me better. Now you can do the\
same for him.\
ROSE\
...but he's not you.\
THE DOCTOR\
He needs you. That's very me.\
DONNA\
It's better than that, though.\
Don't you see what he's giving\
you?\
(to Doctor #2)\
Tell her, go on.\
THE DOCTOR #2\
I look like him. Think like him.\
Same memories, same thoughts, same\
everything, except... I've only\
got one heart.\
ROSE\
Which means..?\
THE DOCTOR #2\
I'm part Human. Specifically, the\
ageing part. I'll grow old. And\
never regenerate. I've only got\
one life, Rose Tyler. I... could\
spend it with you. If you want.\
ROSE\
You'll grow old... at the same\
time as me?\
THE DOCTOR #2\
Together.\
ROSE\

his heartbeat. So intimate, now.\
Moment broken by the Doctor -\
THE DOCTOR\
Oh, and don't forget this -\
Throws them a chunk of coral - Doctor #2 catches it.\
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\
This universe is in need of\
defending. Chunk of Tardis. Grow\
your own.\
THE DOCTOR #2\
But that takes thousands of years.\
THE DOCTOR\
No, because...\
DONNA\
...if you shatterfry the plasmic\
shell and modify the dimensional\
stabiliser to a foldback harmonic\
of 36.3, you accelerate growth by\
the power of 59!\
THE DOCTOR/THE DOCTOR #2\
We never thought of that!\
DONNA\
I'm just brilliant!\
THE DOCTOR\
The Doctor. In the Tardis. With\
Rose Tyler. Just as it should be.\
ROSE\
But... what about you?\
THE DOCTOR\
Oh, I'm fine, I've got madam.\
DONNA\
Human with a Time Lord brain,\
perfect combination! We can travel\
the universe forever. Best friends!\

And I'm him!\
Rose looks at them both. And takes control. The two\
Doctors; the most important decision of her life...\
ROSE\
All right. Both of you. Answer\
me this. When I last stood here,\
on this beach, on the worst day of\
my life, what was the last thing\
you said to me?\
(to the Doctor)\
Go on. What was it?\
THE DOCTOR\
I said, "Rose Tyler."\
ROSE\
And how was that sentence gonna\
end?\
THE DOCTOR\
...does it need saying?\
She turns to Doctor #2.\
ROSE\
And you. Doctor. What was the\
end of the sentence?\
And he smiles. He leans in close. Gentle.\
And he whispers.\
It's the most powerful moment; he steps back again, he and\
Rose just staring at each other. Awestruck. Dazzled.\
Then suddenly, on impulse, she leans forward, pulls the\
Doctor down by the lapel -\
And kisses him!\
And that's all the original Doctor needs to see.\
Heartbroken.\
Donna knows it too, glancing at him.\

you imagine?\

She's moving round the console, he follows, carefully.\

And how does that feel?\
DONNA\
Brilliant! Fantastic! Molto bene!\
Great big universe, packed into my\
brain! D'you know, you could fix\
that chameleon circuit if you just\
tried hotbinding the fragment-links\
and superceding the binary, binary\

Binary, binary, binary, binary,\

She took my mind, into her own\
head. But that's a Time Lord\
consciousness. All that knowledge.\
It was killing her.\
WILF\

I had to wipe her mind, completely.\
Every trace of me, or the Tardis,\

her life.\
SYLVIA\
But the whole world's talking about\
it, we travelled across space.\
THE DOCTOR\
And it'll just be a story. One of\
those Donna Noble stories. Where\
she missed it all, again.\
WILF\
But she was better, with you.\
SYLVIA\
Don't say that.\
WILF\
But she was.\
THE DOCTOR\
I just want you to know... That\
there are worlds out there, safe\
in the sky, because of her. That\
there are people, living in the\
light, and singing songs of Donna\
Noble, a thousand million light\
years away. They will never forget\
her. While she can never remember.\
(pause; upset)\
And for one moment. One shining\
moment. She was the most important\
woman in the whole wide universe.\
SYLVIA\
She still is. She's my daughter.\

Then maybe you should tell her\
that, once in a while.\

So simple, so heartfelt, that the Doctor could cry.\

2 FX SHOT. GALLIFREY - DAY 2\
FX: LONG FX SHOT, craning up to reveal the mountains of\
Gallifrey, as Ep.3.12 sc.40. But now transformed; the\
mountains are burning, a landscape of flame. The valley's\
a pit of fire, cradling the hulks of broken spaceships.\
Keep craning up to see, beyond; the Citadel of the Time\
Lords. The glass dome now cracked and open.\
CUT TO:\
3 INT. CITADEL - DAY 3\
FX: DMP WIDE SHOT, an ancient hallway, once beautiful,\
high vaults of stone & metal. But the roof is now broken,\
open to the dark orange sky, the edges burning. Bottom of\
frame, a walkway, along which walk THE NARRATOR, with staff,\
and 2 TIME LORDS, the latter pair in ceremonial collars.\
FX: NEW ANGLE, LONG SHOT, the WALKWAY curves round, Narrator\

HUGE, CARVED DOORS, already open. A Black Void beyond.\

4 INT. BLACK VOID 4\
FX: OTHER SIDE OF THE HUGE DOORS, NARRATOR & 2 TIME LORDS\
striding through. The Time Lords stay by the doors, on\
guard; lose them, and the doors, as the Narrator walks on.\
FX: WIDE SHOT of the Black Void - like Superman's Krypton,\
the courtroom/Phantom Zone scenes - deep black, starkly\
lit from above. Centre of the Void: a long table, with 5\
TIME LORDS in robes (no collars) seated.\
The Narrator - now designated THE LORD PRESIDENT - reaches\
the table. He puts down his staff, loosens his robes -\
underneath, a battered, black flack-jacket; this man is a\
warrior. One hand is sheathed in a BLUE-METAL GAUNTLET.\
Amongst those seated; THE CHANCELLOR, male, 45, thin,\
worried; THE PARTISAN, female, 50, calm, shrewd.\
LORD PRESIDENT\
What news of the Doctor?\
CHANCELLOR\
Disappeared, my Lord President.\
PARTISAN\
But we know his intention. He\
still possesses the Moment. And\

The Visionary confirms it...\
At the far end of the table; THE VISIONARY. Female, 50,\
insane, swathed in more witch-like robes. Her face covered\
with henna tattoos. She scribbles constantly on old\
parchments with a quill-like pen, muttering (her voice\
muttering always, a constant undercurrent throughout):\
VISIONARY\
...ending, burning, falling, all\
of it falling, the black and pitch\
and screaming fire, so burning...\
CHANCELLOR\
All her prophecies say the same.\
That this is the final hour. That\
Gallifrey falls; that we die, today.\
VISIONARY\
...ending ending ending ENDING!\
Silence. Then:\
PARTISAN\
Perhaps it's time. This is only\
the furthest edge of the Time War.\
But at its heart, millions die\
every second. Lost in bloodlust\
and insanity. With Time itself\
then resurrecting them, to find\
new ways of dying, over and over\
again. We have become a travesty\
of life. Isn't it better to end\
it? At last?\
LORD PRESIDENT\
Thank you for your opinion.\
He lifts his GAUNTLET -\
FX: it shines, with a METALLIC BLUE LIGHT -\
FX: PARTISAN convulses, in pain, swirls away, into nothing.\
LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)\
Now. You were saying?\
Silence. All too scared. Then, suddenly furious:\
LORD PRESIDENT (CONT'D)\
I will not die. Do you hear me?!\
A billion years of Time Lord history\
riding on our backs, I will not\
let this perish, I will not!\
The Chancellor's panicky, goes to the Visionary, takes a\

part of the prophecy, my Lord.\
I'm sorry, it's rather difficult\
to decipher, but... It talks of\
two survivors, beyond the Final\
Day. Two children of Gallifrey.\
LORD PRESIDENT\
Does it name them?\
CHANCELLOR\
It foresees them locked in their\
final confrontation. The Enmity\
of Ages. Which would suggest...\
LORD PRESIDENT\
The Doctor. And the Master.\
CHANCELLOR\
But one word keeps being repeated.\
One, constant word, my Lord.\

Earth.\
VISIONARY\

Planet Earth. Indigenous species:\

You could be so wonderful.\

Where is it?\

You're a genius, you're stone-cold\
brilliant, you are, I swear, you\
really are. But you could be so\
much more. You could be beautiful.\
With a mind like that, we could\
travel the stars. It would be my\
honour. Because you don't need to\
own the universe. Just see it.\
To have the privilege of seeing\
the whole of time and space...\
that's ownership enough.\

...would it stop, then? The noise\
in my head?\

I can help.\

THE MASTER (CONT'D)\
It began on Gallifrey. As children.\
(pause)\
Not that you'd call it childhood.\
Just a life of duty. Eight years\
old, I was taken for initiation.\
To stare into the Untempered Schism.\
WILF\
...what does that mean?\
THE DOCTOR\
It's a gap in the fabric of reality.\
You can see into the Time Vortex\
itself. And it hurts.\
THE MASTER\
They took me there. In the dark.\
On the Eve of Cold Lamentation. I\
looked into Time, old man. And I\
heard it. Calling to me. The\

silhouetted in b/g, in the light of the jeep's headlights.\
Closer...\
At the heart of the crater, the tiny DIAMOND.\
The Guard-Master picks it up, carefully. On radio:\

Doctor? Hello?\
At the far end - a shadow, rushing past, gone.\
WILF (CONT'D)\
Is that you..?\
He hurries along.\
At the end, another stretch of corridor. Empty. Wilf a\
little afraid, spooked by this whole place.\
WILF (CONT'D)\
Anyone? I think I'm lost.\
WOMAN\
And yet you are found.\
He turns round - !\

WILF (CONT'D)\
But what am I supposed to do?\
WOMAN\
This is the Doctor's final battle.\
At the end of his life, he must\
stand at arms. Or lose himself\
and all this world, to the End of\
Time.\
WILF\
But he never carries guns, he\
doesn't do that, he's...\

She's gone.\

Just trying to fix the heating.\
Wilf sits near him. Looks out.\

Always dreamt of a view like this.\
I'm an astronaut! It's dawn over\
England, look. Brand new day.\

Pause. Then, of the view, indicating the Mediterranean:\
WILF\
1948, I was over there. End of\
the Mandate in Palestine. Private\
Mott! Skinny little idiot, I was.\
Stood on this rooftop, middle of a\
skirmish, like a blizzard, all\
these bullets in the air. World\
gone mad.\

Ah, you don't want to listen to an\
old man's tales.\
THE DOCTOR\
I'm older than you.\
WILF\
Get away.\
THE DOCTOR\
I'm nine hundred and six.\
WILF\
Really, though?\

Yep.\
WILF\
Nine hundred years. We must look\

I think you look like giants.\

I'd be proud.\
WILF\
Of what?\
THE DOCTOR\
If you were my dad.\
WILF\
Oh now, don't start.\
The Doctor laughs, a little. But Wilfred's struggling,\
still holding the gun.\
WILF (CONT'D)\
But you said... you were told, he\
will knock four times. And then\
you die. That's him, isn't it,\
the Master? The noise in his head?\
The Master is going to kill you.\
THE DOCTOR\
Yeah.\
WILF\
Then kill him first.\
Silence.\
WILF (CONT'D)\
Don't you deserve it?\
THE DOCTOR\
Ohh yeah. Isn't that the truth?\
Got it in one! I deserve it,\
absolutely! I so deserve to live.\
Everything I've done, the lives\
I've saved, the people, the planets,\

I can't. I just can't.\

You take it, Doctor. That's an\
order. Take this gun.\
(more upset)\
And save your life. Please don't\
die. You're the most wonderful\
man. I don't want you to die.\
Both staring. Both tearful. Wilf takes the Doctor's hand.\
Lifts it to the gun. The Doctor's hand, and Wilf's, on\
the cold metal, together. Like an act of faith.\
And then:\
THE DOCTOR\
Never.\
He gently pushes the gun back to Wilf. And lets go.\

Yeah, but we're getting fired at!\

Unnameable THINGS. The rest filled with MONK & NUN extras.\
FX: an ADIPOSE waddles past Jack, on the counter, mewling.\
Then the barman slides a piece of paper over to Jack.\
BARMAN\
From the man over there.\
Jack's puzzled. Looks up.\
Far across the bar, THE DOCTOR. Just standing there.\
Jack smiles, a little, but stays where he is. Knows\
something's different. Holds up the paper, what's this?\
The Doctor just nods, open it.\
Jack does so.\
A handwritten note, saying:\
His name is Alonso.\

The queue leading to VERITY, sitting at a table, a stack\
of books next to her. She is the image of Joan Redfern\
(eps 3.8 & 9). Chatting to a customer, as she signs.\
VERITY\
...it's not just a story, every\
word of it is true. I found my\
great grandmother's diary in the\
loft. And she was a nurse, in\
1913, and she fell in love with\
this man, called John Smith. Except\
he was a visitor. From another\
world. She fell in love with a\
man from the stars. And she wrote\
it all down.\

But I keep thinking, Doctor...\
There's one thing you never told\
me. That woman. Who was she?\
The Doctor just looks. At Wilf. At Sylvia. At Donna, in\
the distance. Friends, mothers, brides.\
He's not saying.\
THE DOCTOR\
Just wanted to give you this.\
He hands Wilf an envelope.\
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\
Wedding present. Thing is, I never\

Walking through the snow.\

Standing far away, in the snow. OOD SIGMA.\
The song is rising, now, soaring.\

 BLUE SCRIPT\
 08/03/17\
 (SHOOTING BLOCK 4)\
FADE IN:\
1 EXT. SPACE - DAY X 1\
The void of space, sprinkled with stars.\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
Space - the final frontier.\
Now, rotating into frame, the back of a woman\'92s head - as it\
turns, slow and eerie, we see a dead face - staring eyes,\
frosted skin.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
Final because it wants to kill us.\
Wider: tumbling slowly through the frame two spacesuit\
wearing CORPSES without helmets. One male, one female.\
Their spacesuits are the exo-suit like Smartsuits\'ae and will\
later be shown to be autonomous. They\'92re also bearing a\
monolithic \'91Ganymede Systems\'92 logo.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(v.o.)\
Sometimes we forget that. Start\
taking it all for granted; the\
suits, the ships, the little\
bubbles of safety. As they protect\
us from the void... But the void is\
always waiting.\
The CORPSES drift past us and we reveal that they are slowly\
tumbling over \'91Chasm Forge\'92, a space station in the middle of\
an asteroid field. It fills our vision, two concentric rings\
of corridors.\
Protruding from one of the rings, a huge radio dish on a\
laticed girder. And just visible hanging onto the girder, two\
space suited FIGURES.\
A new voice, radio tinny, crackles in. Quiet at first.\
ELLIE\
(out of breath on radio)\
- this isn\'92t the... best timing. I\
know that. Typical me.\
CUT TO:\
2 EXT. CHASM FORGE - DAY X 2\
Close on a gauge marked \'91OXYGEN\'92. It has bars like a phone\
and a last bar flashing red - nearly run out.\
DW10: EP 5 'Oxygen' by Jamie Mathieson - BLUE SCRIPT - 08/03/17 1.\
\'a9 BBC 2016 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 1.\
It\'92s on the wrist of one of the smartsuited figures, ELLIE,\
twenty something.\
She\'92s currently hanging onto the thin latices of the girder\
like monkey bars above her head. She\'92s moving slowly forward\
toward the station, carefully, hand over hand, her weightless\
body hanging free. From her perspective, the station is a\
wall ahead of her, below her, the void of space.\
It looks precarious. One slip means drifting off. And indeed\
we see one of ELLIE\'92s hands slip before she corrects her\
grip. Her breathing quickens for a beat.\
ELLIE\
(out of breath)\
Maybe it\'92s because things are so...\
messed up. You start thinking\
about... what\'92s really important.\
All the trivial stuff just... falls\
away. You realise life... can be so\
brief. So I just want to tell\
you... if we do get through this...\
I want to have a baby. With you.\
We reveal the other figure, twenty feet ahead of ELLIE, also\
making his way identically \'91down\'92 the strut, hand over hand:\
IVAN. From the back, all we can see is that he is also\
wearing a smartsuit and that he\'92s totally ignoring her.\
ELLIE sags and we have a close up of her heads-up display\
inside her helmet \'91SIGNAL ERROR,\'92 with a speaker crossed\
through icon.\
ELLIE (cont\'92d)\
(to herself)\
And as soon as my... radio\'92s fixed\
I\'92m going to tell you just that.\
Close on IVAN, revealed as a weary blonde twenty something.\
He too is breathing heavily in his suit. He shifts his\
posture so that his feet are pointing toward the hull of the\
station as he reaches it.\
Close on the boots, we see MAG stencilled on their sides as a\
clue. They light up and attach to the \'91floor\'92 with a clunk.\
ELLIE follows suit and they are both now standing on the side\
of the station, the radio antenna now beside them like a\
flagpole.\
IVAN points.\
Reveal an AIRLOCK hatch set in the \'91floor\'92 beneath them about\
twenty feet ahead.\
IVAN\
(out of breath)\
Nearly... there.\
We see ELLIE\'92s lips move but hear nothing.\
DW10: EP 5 'Oxygen' by Jamie Mathieson - BLUE SCRIPT - 08/03/17 2.\
\'a9 BBC 2016 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 2.\
2 CONTINUED: 2\
IVAN (cont\'92d)\
(out of breath)\
Still can\'92t hear... you love.\
You\'92re wasting... your breath.\
IVAN looks down at his wrist. His oxygen gauge also has one\
last bar flashing red - nearly run out.\
IVAN (cont\'92d)\
(to himself)\
The one thing... we can\'92t waste.\
IVAN begins to walk toward the airlock. ELLIE begins to\
follow. She looks desperate.\
ELLIE\
(to herself)\
We\'92ll find some more. We have to.\
A shadow falls across ELLIE. She frowns and looks up, shading\
her eyes with her hand.\
Reveal the two CORPSES - they\'92ve drifted to a point where\
they are almost upon her.\
ELLIE looks shocked, suddenly hyperventilating.\
ELLIE (cont\'92d)\
Oh no. No no no no.\
Shockingly, in unison, the CORPSES reach out with both arms,\
but their heads remain dead, inert. These are our monsters,\
from hereon known as CORPSE SUITS.\
ELLIE screams.\
The scream cuts out as we cut to IVAN, who of course, hears\
nothing. He\'92s reached the airlock and crouches, flipping open\
an access hatch. He pulls a handle. Nothing. He tuts and\
produces a small box of tech trailing cables.\
IVAN\
Have to bypass.\
We move closer to IVAN as he works on the hatch. ELLIE no\
longer visible. He attaches wires, punches in a few codes and\
finally is rewarded as the airlock hatch shudders open. He\
fist pumps.\
Then, spinning slowly past him, comes ELLIE\'92s helmet.\
IVAN looks at it dumbly, then slowly turns with dread.\
Twenty feet away the two CORPSE SUITS stand facing him, faces\
still blank, heads lolling in their helmets. Standing up in\
front of them comes ELLIE, sans helmet, eyes open and dead,\
vapour steaming from her eyes and mouth.\
She holds out her arms and begins walking forward.\
DW10: EP 5 'Oxygen' by Jamie Mathieson - BLUE SCRIPT - 08/03/17 3.\

IVAN screams in horror and grief.\
IVAN (cont\'92d)\
Noo!\
CUT TO:\
OPENING TITLES.\
3 INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 1 - 09.10 3\
Darkness.\
THE DOCTOR\
(v.o.)\
So how does space kill you? I\'92m\
glad you asked.\
A piece of chalk wielded by THE DOCTOR comes into frame and\
begins to draw on what is revealed as a blackboard rather\
than darkness.\
We pull back to reveal a crude diagram of a rocket which THE\
DOCTOR has presumably drawn. He draws an arrow leading from a\
hatch in the side of the rocket, then spins to face the\
packed auditorium and begins to pace.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The main problem is pressure. There\
isn\'92t any. So don\'92t hold your\
breath or your lungs will explode.\
As he paces, spouting facts, THE DOCTOR will occasionally\
draw a line on the blackboard with a flourish, without even\
looking, in a cocky display of spacial awareness,\
(foreshadowing ahoy). Each fact accompanies a new line of the\
drawing, \'91hangman\'92 style. But what is he drawing?\
THE DOCTOR (cont'd)\
Blood vessels rupture. Exposed\
areas swell.\
(Draws line)\
Fun fact: the boiling temperature\
of water is much lower in a vacuum.\
(Draws line)\
Which means your sweat and saliva\
will boil... as will the fluid\
around your eyes.\
We reveal BILL sitting in the packed auditorium. She looks\
bewildered. Why is he telling them this?\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\

How big?\
THE DOCTOR sonics the ceiling and lights flicker on,\
revealing that the TARDIS has materialised into an airlock.\
It\'92s a squeeze. Grimy and utilitarian. Doesn\'92t feel that far\
from current space station tech. Behind the TARDIS there is\
an airlock door, in front of it an open doorway missing a\
door, just bare hinges.\
On one wall, a poster with the slogan SAVE YOUR BREATH, a\
stylised oxygen canister and a cross over someone's mouth.\
Feels like 1940's propaganda.\
THE DOCTOR walks off through the open doorway, into a narrow,\
curving corridor.\

There is also a wide window currently looking out at a curved\

Yeah, but on the bright side, we\'92re\
dying already.\
BILL\
How does this help??\
THE DOCTOR\
We know they killed their occupants\
on specific orders. But I think\
these ones are off network, for\
repair. They can\'92t receive any\
commands.\
BILL\
What if you\'92re wrong?\

Doctor, if the suits killed thirty\

thirty-six corpses walking about\
this station.\
THE DOCTOR\

Suits, now!\
Cut to our HEROES stepping into the alcoves. Wide shot as a\
rigid exoskeleton shucks into place around each of them. CU\
on joints clamping shut. CU on Bill\'92s face as a solid collar\
forms around her neck, pan down to see the full smartsuit is\
now in place. All three are now wearing helmetless\
Smartsuits.\
We see a shimmer of the forcefield appear around their noses\

NARDOLE\
Doesn\'92t work like that. When you\

THE DOCTOR\
You die quicker.\
NARDOLE\
Scareder you are, faster you\

We are in a dingy space bisected by a narrow rail track\

We got your distress call.\
THE DOCTOR pulls out the psychic paper from a pouch on his\
suit and hands it to TASKER. In the pause while this is\
handed over and read:\

Yeah. It shows.\
 TASKER looks in awe at the psychic paper.\

They\'92re from the union.\
ABBY\
The union\'92s a myth.\

Take a look.\
The psychic paper is passed around the MINERS like a holy\
relic. Our HEROES exchange looks. What the hell?\
IVAN, previously seen pre-credits. Strung out.\
IVAN\
Darren?\
IVAN passes the paper to DAHH-REN, the last to see it. THE\

This whole area\'92s new. Not in their\

BILL looks confused.\
NARDOLE\
Like when your satnav doesn\'92t know\
a new road?\
BILL\
O-kay. So they can\'92t come here?\
We cut to the spooky Terminator point of view of the nearest\
CORPSE SUIT. Everything is overlaid with a green grid showing\
the limit of their map, with our HEROES inside a red flashing\
grid beyond.\
IVAN\
(distorted)\
They can\'92t even see here.\

As IVAN speaks, we see a jagged sound sample appear on\
screen. Speech recognition kicks in. We see the words THEY\
CAN\'92T EVEN SEE HERE appear on the screen.\
Back to normal view. BILL not totally convinced, but she\'92ll\
take it.\
BILL\
Good. Great. What happened to the\
Doctor? I thought I saw him... die?\
NARDOLE\
He saved you. He gave you his\
helmet.\
BILL\
He died?\
IVAN\
He should have done. I don\'92t know\
how he survived.\
BILL sags with relief, sharing looks of meaning with NARDOLE.\
BILL\
Yeah. He\'92s not exactly... normal.\
NARDOLE\
We tried to get back to the TARDIS\
but there were too many of them.\
But BILL is distracted, watching IVAN, who has taken a step\
closer to the waiting CORPSE SUITS. Then another. Almost\
close enough to touch.\
BILL\
Are you alright Ivan?\
IVAN comes back to earth and takes a step back.\
IVAN\
Sorry. It\'92s just... my wife\'92s\
body\'92s out there. Somewhere.\
BILL\
Oh god. I\'92m sorry.\
IVAN looks ashamed. Still looking out at the CORPSE SUITS.\
IVAN\
Haven\'92t seen her since she died.\
But there\'92s a bit of me that really\
wants to. Is that weird?\
BILL\
No. But I doubt it\'92s a good idea.\

A beat of respectful silence, then:\
NARDOLE\
(to himself)\
I miss all my wives. Even the ones\
that want to kill me.\
BILL gestures sshh. Not now.\
IVAN\
Sorry. We should get back.\
IVAN walks back the way they\'92d come. BILL moves to leave, but\
NARDOLE stops her.\
NARDOLE\
(sotto)\
Listen, about the Doctor. He\
walked in a vacuum, for... far too\
long. He\'92s mostly okay, but he paid\
a price.\
BILL\
What do you mean?\
NARDOLE gestures into the darkness. Go see.\
NARDOLE\
He\'92s in section twelve.\
BILL gingerly walks into the darkness.\
We cut back to the viewpoint of a CORPSE SUIT. The words HE\'92S\
IN SECTION TWELVE appear on the screen. Then SECTION TWELVE\
is highlighted, followed by \'91MAP NOT FOUND - SEARCHING...\'92\
CUT TO:\
32 INT. CONSTRUCTION ZONE 2 - DAY 2 - 11.33 32\
BILL gingerly walks forward. She hears THE DOCTOR before she\
sees him, in conference with DAHH-REN.\
THE DOCTOR\
(o.s.)\
So one touch from a dead suit puts\
you back on the network. And the\
kill command is passed on.\
DAHH-REN\
(o.s.)\
Yes. To your suit battery. And your\
own suit kills you.\

BILL rounds a corner and discovers THE DOCTOR sitting with\
DAHH-REN. It\'92s another uncompleted area, piles of\
construction materials.\
ABBY is off to one side working on a wall mounted radio,\
which has wiring exposed. She has a bolt gun in a holster.\
There is a vibe of desperation.\
ABBY\
Look, this is pointless. Yes, the\
dead suits have oxygen, but we\
can\'92t even get close.\
A promising beeping from the radio distracts ABBY. She picks\
up a handheld microphone attached to it.\
ABBY (cont\'92d)\
(into radio)\
Mining station Chasm Forge calling\
Ganymede Core. Come in.\
ABBY releases a button and is rewarded with static. She\
continues to repeat the message in the background.\
As BILL draws closer to THE DOCTOR, she notices that his eyes\
have changed, the pupils cloudy, the whites veined red. He\'92s\
also staring off into the middle distance and doesn\'92t react\
to her approach.\
BILL\
Doctor?\
THE DOCTOR puts on a brave face. He stands.\
THE DOCTOR\
Bill! You\'92re up!\
BILL waves her hands in front of THE DOCTOR\'92s face. No\
reaction.\
BILL\
You\'92re... blind?\
THE DOCTOR\
I am? Well that explains the\
bruised shins.\
BILL looks moved. Heartbroken. She awkwardly hugs him.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Hey, don\'92t get all gooey on me.\
It\'92s temporary.\
BILL\
Really?\
NARDOLE has returned. He meets BILL\'92s eye and shakes his head\
slowly. It\'92s not.\

I mean they\'92re from a lizard but\
I\'92m sure they\'92ll fit.\
The DOCTOR doing his best to put on a brave face.\
BILL\
So until then...\
THE DOCTOR\
Until then what? You really think\
this\'92ll slow me down? I do most of\
my best work ordering other people\
around.\
DAHH-REN snorts a laugh.\
DAHH-REN\
You do know we\'92re still here?\
THE DOCTOR\
Didn\'92t I send you out to get me a\
latte?\
BILL\
So what\'92s the plan?\
DAHH-REN\
Well we\'92re trying to get a radio\
working and the Doctor\'92s been...\
thinking.\
ABBY pauses at the radio and checks her oxygen wrist gauge.\
Even less of a fan of THE DOCTOR.\
ABBY\
Don\'92t mean to hurry you, but in\
seven hundred breaths I\'92ll be dead.\
THE DOCTOR looks frustrated. He moves away a little, feeling\
his way along the wall. Suddenly vulnerable.\
THE DOCTOR\
I need to think.\
THE DOCTOR stumbles and almost falls but recovers. BILL moves\
to help, but NARDOLE stops her.\

NARDOLE and the MINERS.\
A beat later the radio begins to pulse a faint tone.\

ABBY adjusts the radio, increasing the volume. She looks\
shocked, hopeful.\
ABBY\
Transponder... From a ship.\

Bill, I have no Tardis, no sonic,\

this off?\
BILL\
You always do this. Don\'92t do this.\

pass ABBY, oblivious to the tension. They\'92re excited.\
NARDOLE\
There\'92s a rescue ship on the way.\
DAHH-REN\
Picked up a company transponder.\
We stay on the tension between THE DOCTOR, BILL and ABBY.\
ABBY\
If there\'92s a rescue ship on the way\

THE DOCTOR\
Too many rescue ships. There\'92s a\

ABBY\
Who are you?\
THE DOCTOR\
I\'92m the Doctor.\
ABBY\
And who\'92s the Doctor?\
THE DOCTOR\
On a bad day, the last face you\'92ll\
ever see.\
ABBY\
On a good day?\
THE DOCTOR\
The only story you\'92ll ever tell.\
ABBY\
That doesn\'92t even mean anything.\
THE DOCTOR\
It means I will do everything in my\
power to save all your lives. And\
when I do, you will spend the rest\
of them wondering who I was and why\
I helped you. If anyone\'92s offering\
a better deal, be my guest.\

IVAN gets between them, trying to talk ABBY down.\
IVAN\
Whoa whoa! Look, we\'92re all a little\
punchy.\
We move back to the CORPSE SUITS point of view. The red grid\
showing the limit of their map is suddenly replaced with\
green.\
In unison, they begin to lumber forward.\
IVAN (cont'd)\
It\'92s the oxygen. Thinning. Making\
it harder to think.\
ABBY\
Get out of my way!\
A confusion of adlibbed shouts and motion.\
ABBY bashes IVAN aside, gasps, raises the gun and fires - at\
the CORPSE SUITS who are almost upon them. The leading one\
grips DAHH-REN by the shoulder. A spark jumps and his suit\
immediately locks up.\

A clunk and a hiss. CORPSE SUITS, heading their way.\

concern -\

We reveal this is on the wrist of ABBY. Standing beside her\

Hum and a gurgle of pipes.\

ripping out pipework and wiring like a man possessed. But\

THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Check your readings. We die, your\
precious station dies! The whole\
thing blows. The company will make\
the biggest loss in its history.\
NARDOLE\
... what\'92s happening? What are they\
doing?\
THE DOCTOR\
Sums. They\'92re doing sums.\
And now the suits relax, lower their arms.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
A moment ago, we were too expensive\
to live. Now we\'92re more expensive\
dead. Welcome to the rest of your\
lives.\
ABBY\
But ... but you said ...\
NARDOLE\
You said we were going to die.\
THE DOCTOR\
Technically, I said you were as\
dead as Bill. Probably should\'92ve\
mentioned. Bill\'92s not dead.\
He fumbles inside Bill\'92s collar. There\'92s a bleep and Bill\
startles awake, coughing, spluttering.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Noticed her suit battery was low\
when she put it on. Not enough for\
a lethal dose.\
(Draws her into a hug as\
she coughs and heaves)\
I know what it takes to kill\
someone.\
The Corpse Suits, now advancing again.\
ABBY\
What are they doing?\
THE DOCTOR\
Relax. They\'92re giving us their\
oxygen. It\'92s good for business.\
IVAN gasps.\
IVAN\
Ellie.\
By complete chance, the CORPSE SUIT facing him, is his wife,\
ELLIE.\

IVAN is already crying. ELLIE\'92s eyes are still open, staring\
straight through him.\
Close on Ellie\'92s suit back. It smoothly hinges open,\
revealing a large oxygen tank.\
Exactly the same process is occurring with our remaining\
HEROES in the core.\
The CORPSE SUITS reach behind their own hips and take the\
tanks, which have uncoupled, and swing them smoothly around\
the hips of the HEROES.\
It\'92s like they\'92re embracing, the CORPSE SUITS\'92 faces inches\
from our HEROES. Some of them are wincing.\
The back of our HEROES\'92 suits open and the oxygen tanks\
uncouple and are swapped.\
We have a shot of the same thing happening with BILL.\
The CORPSE SUITS take their tanks, reversing the motion and\
slotting them into their own backs.\
Then they step back and sag. Close on their lights fading\
\'91off\'92 to the sound of electrics powering down.\
Our HEROES all take deep breaths of air. It worked.\
NARDOLE\
It worked! They saved us!\
Then a blaring alarm chime from the console. What now?\
ABBY reaches across and pulls a tiny square of paper from a\
printer.\
ABBY\
It\'92s the receipt.\
Our HEROES sag with weak laughter. All but IVAN, who looks at\
the face of his dead wife.\
IVAN\
(sotto)\
Thank you.\
Bill, now slowly coming to consciousness.\
BILL\
Doctor ...\
THE DOCTOR\
Yep?\
BILL\
I think I\'92m alive.\

Close on THE DOCTOR\'92s eyes as NARDOLE beams at them with what\
looks like a futurisic bar code scanner. The eyes already\
looking back to normal. As he keeps working.\
ABBY\
You could\'92ve told us your actual\
plan in the first place.\
THE DOCTOR\
I could\'92ve told Bill her battery\
was too weak to kill her - but the\
Suits would\'92ve heard. I try never\
to tell the enemy my secret plan.\
BILL\
Or maybe you just like maxing out\
everyone\'92s adrenaline.\
THE DOCTOR\
Maybe. How does it feel?\
BILL\
Pretty okay.\
THE DOCTOR\
Don\'92t get hooked.\
BILL\
Too late.\
THE DOCTOR\
Good.\
NARDOLE lowers the scanner.\
NARDOLE\
Better?\
THE DOCTOR blinks and looks around himself. Reveal that we\'92re\
in the console room and everyone is out of the Smartsuits.\

We\'92re in the Tardis. When did that\
happen?\

BILL and NARDOLE share a look. THE DOCTOR steps to the\
console and begins flipping switches and moving dials,\
apparently back to normal.\
We reveal IVAN and ABBY standing awkwardly off to one side,\
now in grimy overalls.\
ABBY\
Thank you Doctor. For all you\'92ve\
done. And I\'92m sorry I didn\'92t have\
more faith in your -(methods)\
THE DOCTOR\
(interrupting)\
Don\'92t mention it. Now I can set you\
down at a hub world outside\
corporate control. Or anywhere\
really. The universe is your\
oyster.\
ABBY and IVAN have obviously been conferring. IVAN nudges\
ABBY. You tell him. Feels like a big request coming.\
ABBY\
Head office. My head office. We\
have a complaint to make.\
BILL, NARDOLE, and THE DOCTOR share a look.\
THE DOCTOR\
I think that can be arranged.\
Promise you\'92ll be loud?\

BILL appears in the doorway, bag over her shoulder, dressed\
for lunch lady duty. Feels like she\'92s on her way to work.\
BILL\
Does it work?\
THE DOCTOR\
Does what work?\
BILL comes in to sprawl on the chair opposite.\

THE DOCTOR\
No idea. Never had a head office.\
But as far as I remember, there\'92s a\
successful rebellion six months\
later. Corporate dominance in space\
is history, and that about wraps it\
for capitalism. Then the human race\
finds a whole new kind of mistake -\
but that\'92s another story.\
BILL\
Can\'92t wait.\
THE DOCTOR\
But you will.\
BILL\
Laters.\
THE DOCTOR\
Laters.\
BILL leaves. And as she goes, the Doctor seems to sag - as if\
under some terrible new burden.\
Now we reveal NARDOLE standing in the open doorway of the\
TARDIS. Grave, serious - even angry.\
NARDOLE\
Never again.\
THE DOCTOR\
Stop talking now.\
NARDOLE\
I\'92m serious. We were so close to\
not making it back. Then what\
happens to the vault? You know\
what\'92s at stake here.\
THE DOCTOR\
Really, stop talking.\
NARDOLE\
What if you got killed out there?\
What happens to your precious Earth\
then?? You need to be here, you\
need to be ready if that door ever\
opens. Look at me.\
THE DOCTOR\
I can\'92t!\
NARDOLE\
(ADR adjusted so we\'92ll\

What if you came back injured, or\
sick? You really think our friend\

1 INT. THE CASTLE - DAY 1\
Spires and towers, an ancient sprawling castle.\
Now a familiar voice:\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
As you come into this world,\
something else is also born.\
Pulling back -\
We are looking at the sunrise through a row of windows in an\
ancient, stone wall.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
You begin your life and it begins a\
journey - towards you.\
Time lapse photography: as the sun moves in the sky, the\
sunbeams sweep round the room like searchlights...\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
It moves slowly, but it never\
stops.\
Now: cutting round various different locations in this\
sprawling castle world... Colonnades, and chambers, and\
fountains, and libraries ... All in dusty ancient stone.\
Moving closer over details: in every room, mounted somewhere\
on the wall is a Cog Unit - a mechanical fixture that looks\
like it could move the whole wall.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
Wherever you go, whatever path you\
take, it will follow; never faster,\
never slower, always coming.\
Now, tracking along a floor. Sprinkles of blood, streaks of\
it, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling\
themselves along.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
You will run - it will walk. You\
will rest - it will not.\
Now travelling along those corridors, picking out details.\
Every now and then, incongruously, there is a television\
monitor wired into the wall. Each of these is currently\
snowed with interference.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
One day you will linger in the same\
place too long.\

You will sit too still or sleep too\
deep - and when, too late, you rise\
to go, you will notice a second\
shadow next to yours. Your life\
will then be over.\
Now on close on a section of wall. On closer inspection, a\
door.\
A crunching, grinding sound - and the wall section slides\
away revealing -\
CUT TO:\
2 INT. TELEPORT CHAMBER/CASTLE - DAY 2\
A circular chamber of ancient, but active, technology. Brass\
and glass. Intricate mechanisms, spinning and ticking and\
glittering everywhere. Again, dotted around the walls and\
equipment, cogs, this time in gleaming brass.\
Closer on:\
The ceiling spirals down in towards the centre of the room,\
like a funnel. Beneath the base of the funnel, a circular\
glass cabinet, just big enough for a man to stand in. It\
looks like what it is: a teleporter.\
On the teleporter controls.\
The hunched shadow falls over it -\
- a trembling, bloodied hand reaches for a lever -\
The room shakes, shudders!\
On the wall - the brass cogs start glowing.\
The bloodied hand slams the lever and the hunched figure\
falls, crashing to the floor.\
In the glass cabinet, a glow is starting up - exactly like\
the glow we saw as the Doctor dematerialised at the end of\
Trap Street.\
On the walls - the cogs turning.\
The floor - the bloodied hand, shaking with effort, is\
writing letters in the dust.\
B\
Now cutting round various walls of the castle -\
- the cogs turning and turning -\
- faster and faster -\
Back to the bloodied hand, writing in the dust -\

BIR\
The glow in the cabinet, stronger and stronger. Starting to\
take familiar shape -\
The cogs - faster and faster.\
On the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\
but not the finished word.\
The hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a\
moment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\
On the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\
Cutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\
a halt.\
Now on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\
The golden glow is resolving, refining -\
- now clearly, this is the Doctor.\
He is frozen for a moment -\
- then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams\
against the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he\
is.\
A moment to recover.\
Now he\'92s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\
gleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\
A haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\
sickeningly.\
FLASHBACK: Clara\'92s death from Trap Street.\
The Doctor: she\'92s dead, she\'92s gone. Nothing he can do.\
So. To business.\
He glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\
surroundings.\
Straightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is\
observing, he\'92s telling them he means business and he is not\
afraid.\
Finally, he speaks.\
THE DOCTOR\
If you think, because she\'92s dead, I\
am weak, you understand very\
little. If you were any part of\
killing her, and you are not\
afraid, you understand nothing at\
all. So for your own sake,\
understand this. I\'92m the Doctor.\

I am coming to find you. And I will\
never, ever stop.\
He moves to the door - stops. What\'92s he walking in? He\
kneels. The floor seems covered in some strange ashy\
substance - almost as if the floor itself were made of a\
compacted version of it. It clearly piles up in the corners.\
He runs the dust through his fingers. What is that? Doesn\'92t\
matter. He dusts it from his hands, steps to the door. It\
grinds open.\
He steps out into:\
CUT TO:\
3 INT. CIRCULAR CORRIDOR - DAY 3\
A corridor encircles the circular chamber. Four corridors, at\
regular intervals, give off radially from this circle. They\
are labeled North, South, East and West. There are windows\
too. He\'92s clearly in a tower.\
The Doctor steps to one of the windows.\
A very high tower - and encircled by another, much larger\
building. Fifty feet away, a rearing gray cliff face of\
windows. There are walkways connecting this tower to the\
surrounding castle - these are the corridors we already saw.\
He looks down. This building is huge, falls away into mist.\
He looks up. The sky above is coppery - like a sunset.\
THE DOCTOR\
The equipment in that room is\
consistent with an augmented, ultra\
long range teleport. So I am not\
more than a single light year from\
where I was and I am in the same\
time zone.\
(Looks out the window)\
When the sun sets I\'92ll be able to\
establish an exact position by the\
stars. Then you\'92ll have a choice.\
Come out and show yourself. Or keep\
hiding. Clara said I shouldn\'92t take\
revenge. You should know, I don\'92t\
always listen.\
He notices something. Propped against the wall, a perfectly\
ordinary garden spade. On the blade of it, there are traces\
of fresh soil. He rubs the soil between his fingers.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Oh, are you gardeners? Never liked\
gardening. What sort of person has\
a power complex about flowers -\
it\'92s dictatorship for inadequates.\
Or to put it another way - it\'92s\
dictatorship.\

The Doctor will see you now! Show\
me what you\'92ve got! I just watched\
my best friend die in agony - my\
day can\'92t get any worse. Let\'92s see\
what we can do about yours.\
Nothing silence.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Oh, don\'92t try to be mysterious, not\
with me. I don\'92t even have a name,\
I\'92m automatically ahead.\
As he turns, he notices something.\
Words inscribed on the wall behind him. Almost filling it,\
like a page of writing.\
The Doctor\'92s POV.\
Panning along the words, the first line reads:\
As you come into this world\
On the Doctor, reading those words, frowning. Behind him we\
see one of the TV monitors flare into life.\
The picture resolves into a POV shot of a corridor similar to\
the one we are in.\
Now panning down the next line of words.\
something else is also born.\
On the screen: the POV changing. As if standing up from a\
chair, now moving along the corridor ...\
Panning down the next line of words.\
You begin your life and it begins a journey.\
On the screen: the POV has moved towards one of the windows,\
now looking out of it. Through the window we can see another\
wing of the same building, more windows.\
Panning down the next line:\
Towards you.\
On the screen: a sudden, shaky zoom in on one of the windows.\
And we see the Doctor as he is right now! He\'92s caught in\
profile, reading the words on the wall.\
Some instinct makes the Doctor turn -\
- and he sees his own image on the screen.\
What??\
He quickly calculates which window he\'92s being filmed through,\
steps towards it.\

We hold on the screen as the Doctor now appears fully at the\
window, staring right at the camera.\
The Doctor\'92s POV.\
At a window, directly opposite him, a slim, motionless white\
figure is staring back at him. At this distance, no details.\
But it seems slightly ghostly, flowing. As if veiled. (This\
figure we will come to know as Veil.)\
The Doctor glances between the screen and Veil - clearly the\
monitor is showing the creature\'92s POV.\
- and now that POV shifts.\
The Doctor looks back to the creature. It is gone from the\
window -\
- but then is visibly walking slowly past the next window -\
- the walk is odd. One lurching pace, a pause. Another pace,\
another pause. Like one foot strides out, and the other\
drags.\
- now walking past the next window -\
Where\'92s it going?\
The Doctor looks back to the words on the wall.\
Panning down them:\
Wherever you go\
Veil passing another window.\
Whatever path you take\
Another window, another lurch and pause ...\
It will follow\
On the Doctor\'92s face, looking back to Veil. It passes out of\
sight -\
- and now starts along one of the walkway corridors leading\
to the circular chamber he is standing in.\
The Doctor moves to the mouth of that corridor, looks along\
it -\
- we let him go, panning to the monitor on the wall.\
The screen still shows Veil\'92s POV, now lurching and stopping\
down the long corridor leading to the circular chamber. At\
the end of the corridor we now see the Doctor come into view,\
a distant, staring figure.\
We close on the screen - low res on the Doctor\'92s face, slowly\
growing in size as the lurching thing approaches.\

4 INT. CIRCULAR CORRIDOR - DAY 4\
Panning down the carved letter on the wall -\
- reaching, at the foot:\
you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will\
then be over.\
An approaching shadow now extends up over those words. The\
familiar lurch/pause (we still don\'92t see the creature.) As it\
approaches we hear a droning hum, as if of millions of\
insects.\
The shadow stops for a moment - as if uncertain what to do.\
On the Doctor. He\'92s round the other side of the circular\
corridor - the central hub, containing the teleport chamber,\
separates and conceals him from his pursuer.\
His eyes are on:\
The Doctor\'92s POV. A monitor on the wall -\
- Veil\'92s POV, looking one way and the other. And now moving,\
round the hub, towards the Doctor.\
Lurch-pause. Lurch-pause.\
The Doctor, moving too. Keeping Veil on the opposite side of\
the hub.\
Lurch-pause. Lurch-pause. The insect drone moving closer. The\
shadow coming visible.\
The Doctor eyes it, just a shade nervous -\
- and he deliberately comes to a halt!\
THE DOCTOR\
Okay ... let\'92s get a look at you!\
His eyes flick to the nearest monitor. The POV: he can see\
his own shoulder and arm coming into view.\
He swallows hard, visibly nervous. More nervous than he\
expected to be!\
A few flies buzz about now. The Doctor swats at them,\
abstractedly.\

We still can\'92t see the creature, but it\'92s coming into view -\
- and the Doctor\'92s nerve just goes! He starts backing away,\
keeping the creature out of view -\
- matching pace, keeping the opposite side of the hub.\
The Doctor moves more quickly now, circling round the hub,\
almost catching up with Veil - a quarter section still\
separates them. He comes to a halt there.\
The Doctor eyes another of the monitors.\
The creature has paused -\
- and now swings round, starts moving the other way round the\
hub, towards the Doctor.\
The Doctor now backing away, again keeping pace with the\
creature.\
He touches the palms of his own hands. Bemused. He\'92s scared,\
he\'92s sweating. What\'92s the matter with him??\
Lurch-pause. Lurch-pause.\
The flies, approaching shadow.\
On the Doctor\'92s face. It\'92s really getting to him, we haven\'92t\
seen him like this. It\'92s like he doesn\'92t even want to see the\
creature ...\
The Doctor glances round - behind him the mouth of one of the\
corridors (not the one Veil came along.) It stretches away\
and there is a door at the far end.\
The Doctor goes striding along the corridor, racing down it -\
- glancing out the corridor windows as he runs -\
- this whole weird structure, what is it, what is it??\
Now at the door, yanking at the handle -\
Won\'92t budge. Jammed? Locked?\
Whips out his sonic glasses, tries them.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
I hate wood!\
Tries again the door. Damn it, won\'92t move!\

First proper view of the creature. Strange misshapen thing.\

flies buzz in and out.\
The sight of it impacts the Doctor. Seem to knock him back a\
step, transfixes him.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
... I know you.\
Lurch-pause. Lurch-pause. Coming down the corridor.\
The Doctor just staring. For a moment, a rabbit in\
headlights.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
What are you?? I\'92ve seen you\
before!\
Back to business, looking for a way out!\
The corridor is narrow. Too narrow for him to get past the\
creature.\
Lurch-pause.\
The windows!\
No! Even if they opened - they don\'92t seem to - he\'92s hundreds\
of feet up.\
Lurch-pause.\
The door! Only choice!\
Yanks at the handle. Locked! Damn it, damn it!\
Lurch-pause. Closer!\
Locked, still locked, damn it!!\
Kneeling at the door, pressing his fingers against the\
surface. Over his shoulder, Veil - lurch-pause - closer,\
closer.\

Used to know a trick. Back when I\
was young and telepathic.\

He breaks off. Clara\'92s not there. Clara\'92s not listening. He\
suppresses the pain in a moment -\
Yanks open the door -\
- to reveal a blank wall. Just stone-work.\
Stares at it.\
No way out. Trapped here.\
Oh!\
A shuffling from behind ...\
... Veil stepping closer.\

Okay. Can\'92t actually see a way out\

More detail visible now. There is constant movement beneath\
shifting layers of veil, that dreadful insect drone.\
He looks again at the blank stone wall, blocking him off.\

Veil judders to a halt. A silence - the droning has stopped.\
The Doctor staring. What? Now looking around.\
Weird. Impossible. The flies - a moment ago, buzzing around\
him - have all frozen in mid-air.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Something I said? What did I say?\
He looks at one of the flies, inches from his face. He flicks\

On the walls - all the cogs are now turning. Grinding round\
and round.\
The Doctor steps to a window, stares out at the castle.\
Impossible. The whole building is moving! Different floors\
rotating at different speeds.\
What? What??\
An unexpected draft. He spins to look.\
As the building moves, so the stone wall blocking his way is\
sliding away, a gap opening, a whole doorway!\
The Doctor glances suspiciously at Veil -\
- what\'92s this? -\
- then slips through the gap.\
Into:\
CUT TO:\
5 INT. THE DOCTOR\'92S BEDROOM - DAY 5\
A plain, bare bedroom. A bed. A writing desk. The inevitable\
TV monitor mounted on the wall - currently snowing. There\'92s a\
vase of fresh cut flowers on the bedside table.\

He steps to the vase, pulls out one of the flowers, sniffs\
it, then he sees something else!\
- the Doctor stares.\
Over the fireplace an oil painting of Clara.\
He steps closer, examining it. How the hell did that get\
there?\
Touches the frame. Worn, flaked. Like this painting is very\
old.\
The grinding noise stops. Behind him, through the window, we\
see all the other windows stop moving, as the rotating\
sections of building come to a halt.\
The Doctor barely notices, absorbed in the painting. He\'92s\
patting his pockets, looking for something -\
- then notices something on the mantelpiece. A jeweller\'92s\
eyeglass, just what he needs. He picks it up, screws it into\
his eye socket. As he does so, a single fly buzzes behind his\
head.\
He now leans forward, examining the surface of the oil\
painting. As he bends forward to look at it, he clears frame -\
- and we can see the wall-mounted monitor behind him. The\
snow has cleared. On the monitor, we can see a distant image\
of the Doctor as he is now, peering at the painting. The POV\
lurches forward - Veil is approaching again.\
The Doctor\'92s POV - through the lens. The surface of the\
painting - the glaze is a maze of tiny cracks.\
The Doctor steps back from the painting - again, obscuring\
our view of the monitor. Eye glass, still in his eye.\
THE DOCTOR\
Old. Very old. Possibly very, very\
old.\
The Doctor\'92s POV of Clara\'92s face -\
- as a fly lands on it.\
The Doctor: galvanized! Spins.\
Feet from him - lurch-pause.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
When I was very little, there was\
an old lady who died. They covered\
her in veils, but it was a hot day,\
and the flies came. Gave me\
nightmares for years. So who\'92s been\
stealing my nightmares?\

Lurch-pause.\
The Doctor stares thoughtfully at Veil, eyeglass still in\
place.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(Points to the painting)\
You\'92ve been expecting me for a very\
long time. Right?\
Lurch-pause.\
The Doctor casually pulls a petal from the flower (still in\
his hand) tosses it to the floor. (This action, apparently\
casual, has later significance.)\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
So this is a trap? No, worse. A\
prison. No, no! A torture chamber.\
Am I right?\
Lurch-pause.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Oh, somebody should know better.\
Anyone who could set this all up,\
and steal my bad dreams, should\
know a lot better.\
Lurch-pause.\
The Doctor - with a raise of an eyebrow, causes his eye glass\
to pop out, fall to the floor with a clatter.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The secrets I have - no chance. Not\
telling, not me.\
Lurch-pause.\
The Doctor grabs up a stool.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Told you I was scared of dying.\
Wasn\'92t lying either. Advantage: me!\
He hurls the stool at the window - it smashes through in an\
explosion of glass.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Because you won\'92t see this coming.\
And he turns and runs to the window!\
And dives through it!\

There is a row of heavily barred windows along one side of\
the hallway. These don\'92t overlook the water, but some\
interior courtyard.\
An atrium. There are trees growing here.\
He steps to the window. In the atrium, there is a small,\
abandoned garden. Overgrown, misty, creepy.\

There is a small patch of soil, and clearly it has been\
recently dug.\

Well, Clara, what do you think?\

What would you do?\

Same as you.\
The Doctor nods, thoughtfully.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Yes. Yes, you would.\
He goes to the spade, picks it up, hefts it.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Which, lets be honest, is what\
killed you. So! Someone is trying\
to tell me there\'92s something\
important buried in this garden.\
That\'92s almost the first thing they\
tried to tell me. Could be a trick,\
could be a trap. Could be one of my\
predecessors? Because I\'92m not the\
first prisoner here, am I? All\
those skulls in the water ...\

windows.\
Nothing there, not yet - just a few flies, buzzing.\

He squints through at the monitor. The POV appears to be\

He looks round the garden. No other exit.\
He steps quickly to the iron door, pulls it open -\

THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
One way in. Or out.\
(Looks back to the\
monitor)\
So where are you going?\
He moves over to the dug hole, looks down into it.\
He\'92d barely got started. But he needs to know what\'92s down\
there ...\
He looks to the spade wedged under the handle.\
Awkward. His only way of digging.\
He returns to the window, looks at the monitor.\
The POV. Heading along some corridor somewhere. Where to?\
Where\'92s it going?\
He looks thoughtfully at the spade again.\
Dare he?\
Keeping his eyes on the monitor, he reaches carefully for the\
spade, places his hand on it -\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Well ... seeing as you\'92re going ...\
- and now pulls at it, removing it from under the door\
handle.\
Looks to the monitor.\
The POV, seemingly in response, comes to a dead halt.\
The Doctor tenses.\
He moves to shove the spade back in place -\
- but then the POV starts lurching/pausing again. Still\
heading wherever it was going.\
The Doctor. Okay ....\
Looks back to the hole.\
CUT TO:\
The spade slams into the dirt again. The Doctor digging.\
DISSOLVE TO:\
A shot of the sky. Night is falling. Stars coming out.\
The Doctor, digging. Up to his waist now. The trench is\
starting to look like a grave.\
Takes a breather. Glances over at the monitor, visible\
through the barred windows.\

Yep, the screen is black.\
The Doctor, taken back. Didn\'92t see that coming.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
What, is it asleep? Do monsters\
sleep nowadays, that\'92s very modern.\
The monitor is resolutely dark.\
He shrugs, heads back to the hole.\
We hold on the black monitor...\
DISSOLVE TO:\
42 EXT. ATRIUM GARDEN - NIGHT 42\
The distant sky. Black, blazing with stars now.\
The hole is six feet deep now, a proper grave. The Doctor,\
still digging.\
He leans on his spade for a moment - tired, another breather.\
He looks up at the stars -\
- and frowns.\
Squints at them, frowns deeper.\
THE DOCTOR\
No. No, that can\'92t be right.\
Shakes his head.\
Foot pressed on the spade again, and -\
Chunk!\
Finally, he\'92s hit something.\
Stone?\
Sounds like it.\
He kneels, starts clearing the last layer of soil away with\
his hands, revealing ...\
Yep, a stone slab.\
Flashback: the missing flat stone from the kitchen floor.\
So! This is where the stone turned up. That\'92s what has been\
buried here.\
But more than that. There are words scratched deep into the\
stone ...\

... someone has spent a long time on this. This is an\
important message.\
He clears more of the soil away.\
The words revealed.\
I AM\
More words below, he frantically clears more of the soil,\
starting to reveal them ...\
We crane up and back from him, floating above him for a\
moment -\
- and huge in the foreground, a fly drones lazily past us.\
Back on the Doctor, clearing more words ...\
I AM\
IN\
What? What??\
He clears the remainder of the soil.\
I AM\
IN\
12.\
He stares at those words. Touches his fingers to them. What\
does that mean.\
Who wrote that?\
As he stares at the word 12, a fly delicately alights on it.\
A freezing moment.\
It\'92s here, it\'92s back.\
He stands, ready to climb out, to run.\
But then -\
The earthen wall of the hole trembles slightly -\
- and then, blasting through the soil caked mud -\
- an out-stretched skeletal hand!\
The Doctor stumbling back in terror, his feet slipping on the\
mud.\
Horror shot. Veil comes through the now cascading soil, just\
driving the mud and dirt, looming over the Doctor.\
The Doctor on his back, helpless.\

Now two silver skeletal hands, reaching down for him...\
CUT TO:\
43 INT. TARDIS - DAY 43\
Exactly as before, the Doctor comes bounding through the door\
of the TARDIS.\
THE DOCTOR\
Well that was another close one!\
He heads over to the console, cheerfully flicking switches,\
messing about with the controls.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Or it will have been when I\'92ve been\
and gone and got myself out of it.\
So how am I going to do that?\
He looks over at:\
Clara, at the blackboard. As before, her back to him (exactly\
as she died in Trap Street.)\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Come on teacher, ask me questions!\
He swings the monitor round, to look at it -\
- on it, his real life POV. The frozen skeletal hands,\
reaching for him.\
And now we hear the patter of chalk on the board.\
He spins to look -\
- as before, Clara\'92s back, slipping from view -\
- revealing, chalked on the board:\
Tell no lies.\
He stares, frowning at that. What does it mean?\
Flashback: The Doctor\'92s first encounter with Veil, in the\
corridor, his moment of revelation.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Now this is new. I\'92m scared. Never\
realised that - I\'92m actually scared\
of dying.\
Veil stops.\
On the Doctor. He looks up at:\
One of the blackboards on the upper walkway. As before, the\
chalked words are:\

Question 2\
What did you say\
that made the\
creature stop?\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The truth, yes. Couldn\'92t just be\
any old truth, though, Clara. This\
whole place is designed to terrify\
me. Imagine a world where something\
is always coming. Every second,\
something deadly is always closer,\
with every breath you take. You\
can\'92t sleep, you can\'92t sit still,\
every moment you\'92re looking over\
your shoulder. How long before\
you\'92re out of your mind? Before\
you\'92d say anything. Give up anyone.\
I\'92m being interrogated. So it\'92s not\
just truth it wants, that\'92s not\
enough - it\'92s confession.\
He looks to the monitor again, those outstretched skeletal\
hands ...\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
I have to tell truths I\'92ve never\
told before. That\'92s the only thing\
that stops it.\
The Doctor - so haunted now. This is so bad.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Trouble is, Clara ... there are\
truths I can\'92t ever tell ...\
His eyes go to the skeletal hands on the screen.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Not for anything ...\
On the Doctor\'92s face. Something weakens.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
But I\'92m scared, Clara. I\'92m alone\
and I\'92m very, very scared.\
Very deliberately, he lets his eyes flicker shut...\

THE DOCTOR\
I didn\'92t leave Gallifrey because I\
was bored. That was a lie, and it\'92s\
always been a lie.\
The hands -\
- stop.\
Veil freezes. It cocks its head, as if considering.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Not enough? You want more?\
Silence.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
I was scared. I ran because I was\
scared.\
Silence.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Is that what you want me to say??\
Is that true enough for you??\
Silence.\
And Veil stands.\
Steps back from the Doctor.\
The Doctor, now clambering to his feet.\
From above, a great grinding of stone on stone.\
The Doctor, now scrambling out of the hole, looking up.\
As the last time, all the floors of the building are\
revolving at different speeds - like a complex interlocking\
puzzle box, solving itself.\
He heads out through the iron door, into the corridor.\
We hold on his face as he walks. He looks sick at himself.\
Like he\'92s done the worst thing he could have.\
Around him the cogs and stones of the giant castle continue\
to grind, and thunder, and shift.\
CUT TO:\
45 EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT 45\
The Doctor looks out of the open doorway, to the wide ring of\
water - this is the doorway he came through, a few hours ago.\
The castle is still shifting, and moving. The water is\
turbulent.\

Now, bobbing momentarily to the surface, a few of the skulls,\
clearly disturbed by the movement.\
The Doctor stares at them, bleakly, as they sink back down.\
THE DOCTOR\
Oh, Clara. It\'92s hard to be brave\
... when there\'92s no one to pretend\
to.\
We hold on one of the skulls, as it slips back under the\
water ...\
CUT TO:\
46 INT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT 46\
Eerie, moonlit, slow, the skull spirals slowly down through\
the murk -\
- to land with all the others. All those sockets staring\
blankly up at us -\
We hold on one of the skulls.\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
There are two events in everybody\'92s\
life that nobody remembers.\
DISSOLVE TO:\
47 INT. CASTLE STAIRS - NIGHT 47\
The Doctor, heading up stone steps. He stops a moment,\
glances out of the window.\
The Doctor\'92s POV: moonlight glitters on the water far below.\
THE DOCTOR\

Two moments experienced by every\
living thing ...\
He resumes his climb.\
He glances briefly at a monitor on the wall -\

him.\

He turns a corner, heading along one of the corridors, to the\
central tower.\
We let him go, holding on:\
The monitor: the POV, still climbing the stairs.\
CUT TO:\
49 INT. TELEPORT CHAMBER - NIGHT 49\
The Doctor moving round the chamber, examining the equipment -\
then stopping short, as he sees something.\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
Nobody remembers being born ...\
On the floor, the body of the man we saw earlier. Burned to a\
crisp, barely an ashy outline. Only the skull has survived.\
Why?\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
... and nobody remembers dying.\
The Doctor kneels by the body. Stares at the skull. There is\
a wire attached to each temple by little \'93sci fi\'94 suction\
cups at each end. These wires lead back to the console. It\'92s\
like someone tried to wire their own head into the machinery.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
Is that why we always stare into\
the eye sockets of a skull? Because\
we\'92re asking - what was it like?\
Does it hurt?\
Delicately, he lifts the skull up, freeing it from the\
attached wires. Stares into those eerie, empty sockets.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
Are you still scared?\
Then he notices it.\
The last message from his dying predecessor.\
Scrawled in the dust, just the word\
BIRD.\

There\'92s a little spiral staircase at the back of the room,\
leading up somewhere.\
Interesting!\
CUT TO:\
50 EXT. TOP OF THE TOWER - NIGHT 50\
A night sky blazing with stars.\
Panning down to -\
- the flat roof of the central tower. A trap door has been\
flung back, and the Doctor is now climbing up through it, his\
feet clanging on the iron steps. He\'92s still holding the skull\
in one hand.\
He goes to the low wall, ringing the tower, looks out. The\
tower stands taller than the rest of the encircling building.\
He sets the skull down on the wall, delicately - like he\'92s\
giving it a better view.\
Then he looks up at the stars.\
Scanning round, turning, casting a professional eye. Frowning\
at them, like something\'92s wrong.\
On the stars, we\
DISSOLVE TO:\
50A INT. THE DOCTOR\'92S BEDROOM - DAY 50A\
Early morning light at the window. The Doctor slumped in his\
chair, one hand rests on the desk next to him, tapping his\
finger, rhythmically - one beat per second. He looks like\
he\'92s been sitting there a long time, looking at\
- the portrait of Clara.\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
It\'92s funny. The day you lose\
someone isn\'92t the worst - at least\
you\'92ve got something to do. It\'92s\

He opens every door he passes, looks in.\
The first door is marked with the number 105. He looks in.\
A ballroom.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
It\'92s complicated.\
Steps to the next door, which is marked 207. A massive\
library.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\

It goes on and on.\

Sea, stretching blue to the horizon.\
The reverse: the Doctor is standing at an open door, but this\

He moves to the immediately adjacent door, which is marked 7.\
THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
The numbering is a bit confused.\
He opens his note book, makes a note.\
Close on the notebook - a beautifully intricate map of this\
floor of the castle. He\'92s adding the numbers 46 and 7.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
As if the rooms are all jumbled up.\
The Doctor\'92s eyes flick to one of the cog units on the wall.\
He steps closer to it, examines it.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
Maybe they move around sometimes. I\
saw the whole castle move, when ...\
(He\'92s now frowning as he\
examines the cogs)\
... when I made the creature stop.\
On his notebook. Flicks a page - we see a perfect copy of the\
words on the buried flagstone, like he\'92s drawn it. \'93I am in\
12.\'94\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
I\'92m supposed to find room 12. The\

A different day. Daylight streaming through a window. The\

One good thing about it. It tidies\
up after itself.\
He crosses to the vase of flowers -\

He moves quickly down the steps, pulls open the door, and -\

The Hybrid.\
The hand ... stops!\
The Doctor looks at Veil. Totally cool, in command.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Long before the Time War, the Time\
Lords knew it was coming. Like a\
storm on the wind. There were many\
prophecies and stories. Legends\
before the fact. One of them was\
about a creature called the Hybrid.\
Half Dalek, half Time Lord. The\
ultimate warrior. But whose side\
would it be on? Would it bring\
peace or destruction? Was it real,\
or a fantasy? I confess: I know the\
Hybrid is real. I know where it is,\
and what it is. I confess: I am\

He waits. Totally confident.\

The Doctor, hurrying down the stairs.\
CUT TO:\
68 INT. DARKER CORRIDOR - NIGHT 68\
The Doctor, striding along - now breaking into a run!\
Rounding a corner to:\
The steps leading down to Room 12. He hurries down them,\
pulls open the door.\
The wall is gone, stretching ahead of him -\
- a very, very long, very narrow corridor. The walls are\
black. The only illumination is a faint glow in the far, far\
distance. Barely a point of light.\
Tentatively, he steps into the corridor.\
CUT TO:\
69 INT. BLACK CORRIDOR - NIGHT 69\
The Doctor, looking around. Touches his hand to the wall.\
Black and smooth. No purchase. No other exits.\

Okay ...\
He starts moving along the corridor. As he moves we see him\
instinctively clicking his fingers, counting out the seconds\
We let him go, panning up to a television monitor mounted\
over the door.\
The POV is descending the stairs...\
CUT TO:\
The Doctor, making his way along the corridor. Scanning the\
walls with his sonic glasses - nothing useful... (Click,\
click, click.)\
CUT TO:\
70 INT. EXIT CHAMBER - NIGHT 70\
The corridor leads into:\
A huge cube of a room. Almost featureless. All the walls,\
floor and ceiling are in glossy black, everything gleaming\
and smooth and dark as night -\
- except for the wall directly opposite him.\
A wall of diamond! It blazes, translucent, glittering. To one\
side is one of the Cog Units, suggesting that this wall moves\
too.\
And there is something carved into the wall. The Doctor steps\
closer to look.\
We hold on his face, not yet seeing what he sees.\
THE DOCTOR\
Of course! The final square on the\
board. What else would it be?\
The Doctor\'92s POV. Carved in the centre of the diamond wall, a\
few feet above his head the word -\
HOME\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The TARDIS.\
He puts out his hand, touches the wall.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
One confession away.\
He takes his glasses, scans the wall.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Azbantium. Four hundred times\
harder than diamond. Twenty feet\
thick.\

He pops his glasses back on, tries to peer through the\
translucent material - that shifting light beyond.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Beyond it ... what is that?\
Dimensional transfer junction,\
going by the luminescent\
dissonance. The way out?\
FLASHBACK: the word BIRD, written on the floor by the dead\
man in the teleport chamber.\
The memory impacts on the Doctor - almost physical.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Bird ...\
As he says this, something changes in his face. A moment of\
realisation. Intense, room-shifting. Life-changing.\
Oh God! Oh God, no!\
He gets it now. He knows what he has to do. And whatever it\
is, it\'92s a vision of utter hell -\
- and the clicking fingers stop...\
CUT TO:\
71 INT. TARDIS - NIGHT 71\
The Doctor comes striding through.\
But unlike before he\'92s sombre, subdued. And under that, so,\
so angry.\
Goes to the console. Leans on it, heavily.\
THE DOCTOR\
That\'92s when I remember. Always\
then. Always exactly then.\
He looks up.\
Clara, her back to him, standing at the blackboard.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Oh, Clara. I can\'92t keep doing this.\
I can\'92t. Why\'92s it always me? Why is\
it never anybody else\'92s turn??\
Of course, there\'92s no answer, no reaction.\
He looks round -\
- the blackboard on the upper walkway. It still reads:\

for a while.\

The Doctor, pacing round the console now ...\
THE DOCTOR\
It would be so easy. Just tell\
them. Just tell whoever wants to\
know, all about the Hybrid.\
CUT TO:\
74 INT. EXIT CHAMBER - NIGHT 74\
On the Doctor, sitting despairing against the wall.\
On his eyes - dull, almost tearful - as they flick up. He\'92s\
heard a noise.\
The Doctor\'92s POV: he\'92s sitting directly opposite the long\
black corridor. Distantly, at the far end, we can just make\
out the door opening...\
The Doctor just stares - not moving, not reacting. Barely\
seems interested.\
CUT TO:\
75 INT. TARDIS - NIGHT 75\
The Doctor striding round the console, increasingly agitated\
and angry.\
THE DOCTOR\
I can\'92t keep doing this. I can\'92t\

this once, can\'92t I give in? Can\'92t I\

- still standing with her back to him. But chalked on the\
blackboard in front of her, a single word:\
No!\
The Doctor, staring hopelessly at that word.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
But I can remember, Clara. You\
don\'92t understand, I can remember it\
all. Every time!\
Just the word No!\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
And you\'92re still gone. Whatever I\
do, you still won\'92t be here.\
The Doctor sags. Like that admission ripped the heart out of\
him.\
And then, impossibly - her voice.\
CLARA\
Doctor.\
He startles, looks at her. What?\
And magically, impossibly -\
- she turns to face him. Clara Oswald, fixing him in the eye.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
Stop it. Just stop.\
He stares at her.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
You\'92re not the only person who ever\
lost someone. It\'92s the story of\
everybody. Get over it. Beat it.\
Break free.\
She steps towards him, puts a hand to his face.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
Doctor, it\'92s time. Get up off your\
arse ... and win!\
CUT TO:\
76 INT. EXIT CHAMBER - NIGHT 76\

Veil, near the end of the corridor.\
THE DOCTOR\
Hello again. No more confessions,\
sorry. But I will tell you the\
truth.\
He turns to the diamond wall, seems to square up to it. Then -\
methodically, with confidence, like this is something he does\
all the time - he winds back his arm and simply punches the\
wall, as hard as he can. Shakes his hand.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Ouch!\
But he winds back his arm again and punches the wall again.\
He continues to talk - calm conversational - as he does this.\
(All the time Veil is getting closer.)\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The Hybrid is a secret. It\'92s a\
very, very dangerous secret and it\
needs to be kept.\
(Punch!)\
So I\'92m telling you nothing. Nothing\
at all. Instead, I\'92m going to do\
something far worse.\
(Punch!)\
I\'92m going to get out of here. I\'92m\
going to find who put me in here in\
the first place, and whatever\
they\'92re trying to do, I\'92m going to\
stop it.\
On Veil - lurching, pausing, so close!!\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(Punch!)\
And then I\'92m going to come back to\
this place, and I\'92m going to rip it\
apart with my bare hands, and you\
with it.\
(Punch!)\
But it might take me a little\
while, so would you like me to tell\
you a story?\
Veil, only a few feet away - stretching out its skeletal hand\
...\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(Punch!)\
The Brothers Grimm. Lovely fellas.\
They\'92re on my darts team.\
Veil\'92s hand, closer and closer to the Doctor. As it nears\
him, it starts to glow.\

According to them, there\'92s this\
Emperor who asks this shepherd\'92s\
boy, \'93How many seconds in\
eternity?\'94 And the shepherd\'92s boy\
says -\
And he breaks off in a terrible scream!!\
Veil is gripping the Doctor, deadly tight. The Doctor\'92s body\
is glowing, fierce and bright. He twists and screams like\
he\'92s burning. It goes on and on, and then -\
The Doctor slams, lifeless, to the floor. Dead as a doornail.\
Veil steps back from the body, stands for a moment. Almost as\
if penitent. Then the faint glow of a teleport, and Veil\
fades away.\
Now, cutting round the various monitors in the castle -\
- they all cut to the snowing interference we saw at the very\
beginning.\
Now, on the Doctor, limp and dead on the floor.\
Close on his face. Was that a twitch of his mouth?\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\

People always get it wrong with\
Time Lords.\

We take forever to die.\
He raises a hand, flicks a few switches. The console monitor\
flares on, showing a schematic of the Doctor\'92s crumpled body.\

Even if we\'92re too injured to\
regenerate, every cell of our\
bodies keeps trying. Dying\

This place is my own, bespoke\

only. But all those skulls in the\
water? How could there have been\

This time we see it is the Doctor himself, barely able to\
stand.\
A crunching, grinding sound - the door slides away, revealing\
the teleport chamber itself. The Doctor staggers in.\

Desperately weak and dying, the Doctor staggers to the\
console.\

Every room resets - remember I told\
you that? Every room returns to its\

should do the same.\

THE DOCTOR\
(V.O.)\
The room has reset. Returned to its\
original condition, when I arrived.\
That means there\'92s a copy of me\
still in the hard drive. Me,\
exactly as I was when I first got\
here - seven thousand years ago.\
The Doctor is picking up the wires he earlier removed from\
the skull. He attaches them to his own head, with the little\
\'93sci fi\'94 suction cups at the end. The wires run into the\
depths of the console, so it\'92s like he\'92s wiring himself into\
the machinery.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
All I need to do is find some\
energy. And all you need for energy\
is something to burn.\
He braces himself. This is going to be tough.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
(V.O.)\
How long can I keep doing this,\
Clara? Burning the old me to make a\
new one?\
He steadies himself for the horror -\
- then reaches his bloodied hand for the lever (the same shot\
as at the beginning.)\
He slams the lever.\
This time we see the Doctor spasm, energy arcing through him -\
- then he goes crashing to the ground.\
(The following is exactly as at the beginning ... )\
In the glass cabinet, a glow is starting up - exactly like\
the glow we saw as the Doctor dematerialised at the end of\
Trap Street.\
On the walls - the brass cogs, glowing brighter and brighter.\
The floor - the Doctor\'92s bloodied hand, shaking with effort,\
is writing letters in the dust.\
Now cutting round various walls of the castle -\
- the stone cogs turning and turning -\
- faster and faster -\

The glow in the cabinet, stronger and stronger. Starting to\
take familiar shape -\
The brass cogs - faster and faster.\
The stone cogs - faster and faster. Now the cogs are glowing\
faintly. We pan down to the streaks of blood on the floor.\
They too glow, just like the cogs. Now they are evaporating.\
Puffing into steam.\
On the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\
but not the finished word.\
The hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a\
moment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\
On the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\
Cutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\
a halt.\
Now on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\
The golden glow is resolving, refining -\
- now clearly, this is the Doctor.\
He is frozen for a moment -\
- then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams\
against the glass of cabinet, starts to register where he is.\
A moment to recover.\
Now he\'92s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\
gleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\
A haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\
sickeningly. He\'92s thinking about Clara\'92s death.\
The Doctor: she\'92s dead, she\'92s gone. Nothing he can do.\
So. To business.\
He glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\
surroundings.\
Straightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is\
observing, he\'92s telling them he means business and he is not\
afraid.\
Finally, he speaks.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
If you think, because she\'92s dead, I\
am weak, you understand very\
little. If you were any part of\
killing her, and you are not\
afraid, you understand nothing at\
all. So for your own sake,\
understand this.\

And smash!!!\
The Doctor stares in shock. Veil freezes. What. What???\
The thin layer of diamond remaining in front of the Doctor\
now crazes with crack-lines.\
And shatters!!\
Blinding light from beyond!!\
The Doctor shields his eyes in shock, looks away -\
- to see Veil frozen.\
Then Veil slowly collapses to the ground, disintegrating as\
it goes. A few cogs - like the ones on the walls - clatter\
and roll from its disintegrating form. Its finished, over.\
On the Doctor, looking down at the shattered remnants, the\
light blazing behind him. Finally completes his story.\

The Doctor, blinded by too much light, can hardly see.\
He looks behind him to see where he came from -\
- but there is just a jagged hole hanging in space, through\
which we can still see the darkened corridor.\
But as he watches, the hole shrinks and disappears, like the\
picture dwindling to a dot on an old television -\
- the dot falls to the ground, now a physical object,\
glittering in the sun.\
The Doctor bends, picks it up -\
Oh!\
His own confession dial, now fully open.\
He peers inside - revealed a tiny castle in the middle of an\
ocean. Where he\'92s been all this time!\
And the dial snaps shut.\
He runs his fingers round it.\

He turns slowly, squints into the distance, shields his stilladjusting eyes.\
We don\'92t yet see what he sees - but it changes everything.\
A noise makes him turn. Watching him nervously from the\
shadows, a little boy. The equivalent of a shepherd\'92s boy.\
He\'92s staring at the Doctor in astonishment - this man who\
came out of nowhere.\
THE DOCTOR\
Go to the city. Find somebody\
important, and tell them I\'92m back.\
Tell them I know what they did and\
I\'92m on my way.\
The boy, confused, forming a question.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
If they ask you who I am, tell them\
I came the long way round.\
The boy turns, and runs. The Doctor watches him go. His eyes\
raise to the boy\'92s destination.\
And we move round behind, and finally see what he can.\
A few miles away looming out of the desert, a vast city under\
a huge gleaming dome. Gallifrey.\
The Doctor takes a moment, staring at it, drinking it in.\
He looks at the Confession Dial, still in his hand.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
You can probably still hear me - so\
just between ourselves, you\'92ve got\
the prophecy wrong. The Hybrid\
isn\'92t half Dalek. Nothing\'92s halfDalek - Daleks wouldn\'92t allow it.\
He pockets the dial, takes out his sonic glasses.\

The Hybrid ... destined to conquer\

1 EXT. AMERICAN DESERT - DAY 1\
A diner standing by a dusty road in the baking heat. A few\
cars pass, and then -\
- a truck rumbles to a halt.\
Now climbing out of the back -\
- the Doctor! He bangs the side of the truck, indicating that\
he\'92s out. The truck pulls away.\
He\'92s carrying a rucksack, a guitar is slung over his back\
(similar to his usual one, but not the same. Different\
colour?) He\'92s not dressed in his usual gear - dustier, looks\
a bit like a drifter. Wearing his shades.\
CUT TO:\
2 INT. DINER - DAY 2\
Deserted. A row of empty booths. It\'92s the same diner as in\
The Impossible Astronaut.\
At the counter, there\'92s a girl, her back to us, leafing\
through a magazine. She turns, as the door pushes open. It\'92s\
Clara. She\'92s dressed as a server.\
And through the door comes the Doctor.\
He approaches, leans against the counter. She smiles,\
brightly. Perhaps surprisingly, she gives no indication of\
recognising him.\
CLARA\
Hi. What can I get you?\
The Doctor, staring at her for a moment. Like he\'92s searching\
her face.\
THE DOCTOR\
I don\'92t have any money. But I play.\
CLARA\
(Considers.)\
... okay.\
CUT TO:\
Few minutes later: The Doctor moves over to one of the\
tables, pulling his guitar off his back.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
Don\'92t you need to plug that in\
somewhere?\
THE DOCTOR\
Yeah.\

He\'92s taken his shades off, now tosses them on a table. Close\
on them, as they land - the slightest beep.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
You\'92re English.\
CLARA\
You\'92re not.\
THE DOCTOR\
How did you get out here?\
CLARA\
Magic. Or maybe I went to an\
airport and caught a plane. You?\
THE DOCTOR\
Magic.\
He plays a few chords. The sound comes out of every speaker\
in the diner - the radio, the television, everywhere.\
She looks round at this, amused.\
CLARA\
I believe you.\
A tiny smile from the Doctor too. Pleased to impress. He\
pulls off his coat, tosses it over the back of a chair - so\
dusty. Clara notes this.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
You\'92ve been travelling.\
THE DOCTOR\
From time to time.\
He sits now, starting to play.\
We might recognise it as Clara\'92s theme, from the show. A sad,\
slow version.\
Clara: listening, moved.\
CLARA\
Is it a sad song?\
THE DOCTOR\
Nothing\'92s sad till it\'92s over. Then\
everything is.\
CLARA\
What\'92s it called?\
THE DOCTOR\
I think it\'92s called Clara.\
Clara watches him play for a bit - this mysterious, dusty man\
who\'92s walked out of the desert.\

3 EXT. GALLIFREYAN DESERT/CITY - DAY 3\
The horizon, almost lost in the heat shimmer.\
Defocussed, a figure approaching, like a gunfighter coming in\
from the desert.\
Resolving into focus. It\'92s the Doctor. His coat slung over\
his shoulder, sweating slightly in the heat. (This shot\
should resemble the arrival of the John Hurt Doctor in The\
Day Of The Doctor.)\
The Doctor\'92s POV: shimmering in the heat, there it is. The\
barn (again, the one we saw in the 50th and Listen.)\
The Doctor heads towards it. As he moves out of shot, he\
reveals, far behind him -\
- distantly the city of Gallifrey, glittering under its\
mighty glass dome. The Doctor is heading away from it.\
We let him go, now closing on the distant city. We hear the\
tolling of what sounds a little like the cloister bell.\
Now, closer on the city - the gleaming towers beneath the\
glass.\
And now, more tolling, more bells - like many different\
cloister bells, all slightly different tones and registers.\
Like every bell in the city is tolling in the direst\
emergency.\
Now closing in on one of the towers -\
Homing in on a window, and we can just discern a robed figure\
staring out ...\
CUT TO:\
4 INT. HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY 4\
A vast and fabulous room, one that commands all Gallifrey. At\
the centre a conference table. The Time Lords in their robes\
and headdresses.\
There is a vacated chair at the end of the table.\
The recent occupant is staring out of the window, his back to\
us.\
Silence.\

The Time Lords glancing at one another, uneasy. Closer on one\
of them: the General (as played by Ken Bones in The Day Of\
The Doctor.)\
THE GENERAL\
Sir? Lord President?\
The President turns. As when last seen, there is a metal\
gauntlet on his left hand.\
THE PRESIDENT\
Are all the bells ringing? The\
whole cloister?\
The General raises his wrist communicator, speaks into it.\
THE GENERAL\
What\'92s going on down there?\
CUT TO:\
4A INT. CLOISTERS - DAY 4A\
The dark underbelly of the Time Lord capitol - the cloisters.\
Shadows and pillars, and thin layer of cold mist. A forest of\
marble columns and ancient metal struts. Rivets and\
gargoyles. It\'92s like a huge crypt imagined by Terry Gilliam -\
and the very last place you would ever want to set foot.\
(We now intercut between this and the High Council chamber,\
as required.)\
Closer on:\
Gastron, a youngish, uniformed Gallifreyan soldier. He is\
standing just inside a lift, set incongruously in one of the\
stone walls. He peers cautiously out of the lift doors -\
clearly this place frightens him -\
GASTRON\
The Sliders are everywhere, sir.\
Loads of the things.\
THE GENERAL\
(A slight twinge of\
impatience.)\
Language, please, I\'92m with the\
President.\
GASTRON\
Sorry, sir. The Cloister Wraiths\
are active.\
Gastron\'92s POV. Distantly among the pillars and struts, there\
are ...\
What are those?\
At first glance, they seem like Time Lords, in their robes\
and headdresses.\

But even in silhouette, they are weirdly tall, elongated. And\
they glide along the floor, like Daleks, or Colony Sarff. Not\
soundless - the air filled with what sounds like angry\
whispering. (At this stage we barely glimpse the Sliders -\
they just flicker among the pillars.)\
Gastron\'92s eyes move to where there are some tall, vacant\
alcoves carved into the walls - clearly where the Sliders\
emerged from.\
THE GENERAL\
Do not approach them. Don\'92t even\
enter the cloisters. Just tell me -\
are all the bells ringing?\
GASTRON\
Yes, sir.\
CUT TO:\
4B INT. HIGH COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY 4B\
The General turns to the President.\
THE PRESIDENT\
So. We\'92re facing great danger then.\
THE GENERAL\
The Cloister Wraiths seem to think\
so.\
THE PRESIDENT\
Then where is he? Where has the\
Doctor gone?\
From off:\
OHILA\
Back to the beginning, I should\
think.\
The President turns to look - as do they all.\
Ohila stands in the doorway, flanked by two of the Karn\
sisterhood.\
Tension in the room - these visitors were not expected.\
THE PRESIDENT\
The Sisterhood of Karn have no\
business in this chamber, or on\
this planet.\
OHILA\
I heard the Doctor had come home.\

5 INT. THE BARN - DAY 5\
The same barn as we saw in Listen and The Day Of The Doctor.\
The door is swinging open.\
The Doctor stepping through the doorway. Looking around.\
The barn: a little dilapidated, probably unused. Probably\
untouched since the last time he stood here.\
At the other end of the barn: the ladder to the upper floor\
section (as in Listen, but not in Day), the bed and the\
window visible just beyond.\
The Doctor now climbing the ladder.\
His shadow now falling over the child\'92s bed. It\'92s been made,\
tidied up. Like a shrine.\
The Doctor bends, looks under the bed. Nothing there -\
- and now the creak of an opening door. Now a woman\'92s voice.\
She\'92s prattling away, even as she enters.\
THE WOMAN\
(From off)\
- why are they ringing all the\
bells, never heard so many? What\'92s\
gone wrong this time, all the fuss\
they\'92re always making.\
The Doctor straightens up at the sound of this voice. Still\
with his back to her.\
THE WOMAN (cont\'92d)\
You! You up there, you\'92re not\
supposed to be there!\
The Doctor turns, looks down at her.\
The Woman - plump, elderly. Dressed in simple clothes, like\
she\'92s from the Gallifreyan version of The Waltons.\
THE WOMAN (cont\'92d)\
Only just put all that back. It\'92s\
for the boys, if any of them ever\
want to come and -\
She breaks off, staring at him. Like she\'92s starting to\
realise who this is.\
Her eyes widen. An incredulous look. Her head cocks, like\
she\'92s starting to ask is it you? but can\'92t even form the\
words.\
The Doctor: expressionless. He just inclines his head, the\
slightest nod. Yes.\
She can\'92t speak for a moment. Then:\

A plate of soup being placed, reverently, on a table.\
The Doctor sitting at a table, set up just outside the barn.\
He looks at the soup, then to the Woman who just placed it in\
front of him.\
She is standing back from the table, seemingly intent on just\
watching him eat.\
The Doctor: momentarily disconcerted by this. Then what the\
hell.\
Lifts his spoon and starts to eat.\
Pulling back now:\
Past a man of about the same age as the Woman, could well be\
her husband, also just watching.\
Still pulling back: more and more people - adults and\
children, all simply dressed - just standing there, solemnly\
staring at him, like he\'92s the most amazing sight ever.\
Back and back, more and more.\
Closer on the Doctor again: looking around them all. He\
toasts them all with a spoonful of soup, knocks it back.\
As his spoon descends to the soup again -\
- a rumble.\
The surface of the soup ripples and quivers.\
Wider: a massive shadow slides over the barn and the group\
standing outside it.\
They all turn to look:\
It hangs about twenty feet in the air, facing the Doctor over\
the heads of the assembled villagers. Massive and lumbering,\
like a giant mechanical mosquito. It\'92s the size a troopcarrying helicopter, but bristles with sci-fi weaponry.\
So many guns clicking and revolving into place. All centering\
on the Doctor. This is a Sky Tank.\

GASTRON\
At least move the children away!\
On the kids. Nope! Not one of them makes any move to leave.\
And clatter!\
The Doctor has banged down his spoon in his bowl. Everyone\
spins to look at him.\
He pushes back his chair, stands.\
Every movement is stared at. Heads turn as he walks round the\
table. The crowd parts as he walks calmly, towards the Sky\
Tank, as it hangs impossibly up there.\
GASTRON (cont\'92d)\
Doctor, you will lay down any\
weapons on your person and\
accompany us to the capitol.\
But the Doctor says nothing, just keeps approaching. In\
danger of passing under the Sky Tank -\

The Doctor still advancing, the Sky Tank still reversing.\
And the Doctor comes to an abrupt halt, just standing there.\
The Sky Tank halts too. The Doctor has moved it about twenty\
feet from the barn.\
GASTRON (cont\'92d)\
Doctor?\
Very deliberately, the Doctor places one foot in front of the\
other, and with the toe of his leading boot, draws a short\
line in the sand. This just a couple of feet in front of the\
hovering tank.\
The Doctor points to the line. Points to the tank. Wags his\
finger. Nobody is to cross that line.\
He turns and starts walking back to his table. The others all\
applauding now.\

The Time War is history now. The\
darkest of days. Things were done,\
that should never have been\
contemplated. But when the fighting\
stops, surely the first duty of\
peace ... is forgiveness.\

THE PRESIDENT\
Name them.\
THE DOCTOR\
Get off my planet.\
A beat. The President - he\'92s colder now too.\
THE PRESIDENT\
You have nothing, Doctor. Nothing.\
Do you know what I have? Out here,\
in the drylands, where there\'92s\
nobody who matters.\
(Leans in to the Doctor -\
low and threatening)\
No witnesses.\
The Doctor leans in too.\
THE DOCTOR\
Me too!\
The President\'92s eyes flash - the Doctor\'92s gone too far. The\
President strides away from him, yelling to his troops.\
THE PRESIDENT\
Take aim. Take aim at the Doctor,\
fire on my command.\
The General, thrown by this.\
THE GENERAL\
Sir?\
THE PRESIDENT\
Step forward and take aim, now!\
What\'92s the matter with you??\
The soldiers - a little uncertain, shooting glances at the\
General - start moving forward, forming themselves into an\
approximation of a firing squad. The reluctance is palpable.\
The Doctor, just standing. Unmoving, unmoved.\
The General, stepping closer to the President.\

riveted. Clearly he\'92s been telling her a story (and has just\
asked for lemonade.)\

Oh, you like a cliffhanger, don\'92t\
you?\
THE DOCTOR\
(Smiles, another private\

Have we met?\
CLARA\

I don\'92t think so - have we?\

No, probably not.\
She gets up to fetch the lemonade.\
CLARA\
So you went back to your home town\

Something like that.\

21 EXT. BARN - DAY 21\
The President - staring.\
The General - barely able to look.\
The firing squad - standing with their lowered weapons.\
Closer on the wall of the barn. A pattern of scorch marks,\
like bullet holes.\
Panning over the \'93bullet holes\'94 - there is an empty patch in\
the middle, about the size of a man.\
Pulling back:\
The Doctor stands exactly where he was. Every blast missed\
him!\
He just stands. Unmoved, unmoving.\
THE PRESIDENT\
You missed?? All of you, every\
single one of you?? How is that\
possible?\
(Rounds on the General)\
How??\
The General: no answer. Pained - he\'92s on the Doctor\'92s side\
but he can\'92t say that!\
THE PRESIDENT (cont\'92d)\
(At the firing squad)\
Is the firing squad afraid of the\
unarmed man??\
He steps closer to Gastron, shoves his face at him.\
THE PRESIDENT (cont\'92d)\
You - explain.\
Gastron staring mutinously ahead for a moment - then turns to\
the President.\
GASTRON\
There was a saying, sir ... in the\
Time War ... The first thing you\
will notice about the Doctor of War\
is that he\'92s unarmed. For many, it\
is also the last.\
He unslings his gun, and throws it to the sand - it\'92s\

The Doctor looks at him.\
GASTRON (cont\'92d)\

Another weapon hits the sand. Another of the soldiers is\
walking to join the Doctor.\
On the President - speechless in horror.\

The President, raises his gauntleted hand, aims it at the\

You leave me no choice, Doctor.\
And he aims the gauntlet at the Doctor.\
THE PRESIDENT (cont\'92d)\
How many regenerations did we grant\
you? Because I\'92ve got all night.\
On the Doctor: that saturnine face, immobile - except for the\
tiniest flick on his eyes. Just the tiniest glance at the\
horizon behind the President.\
The President: what\'92s behind him? He turns to look.\
The President\'92s POV: in the darkening sky over the domed\
city, many lights are ascending. We hear the distant drone of\
more Sky Tanks, approaching.\
THE PRESIDENT (cont\'92d)\
(To The General)\
Excellent - you sent for\
reinforcements.\
THE DOCTOR\
No, he didn\'92t.\
The President whirls on the Doctor -\
- who is slipping on his sonic glasses (we hear them beeping\
very slightly)\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
I did.\
The President, staring at the Doctor - what?? The drone of\
the Skytanks, building, building.\
He raises his gauntlet again, pointing it right at the\
Doctor\'92s face -\
THE PRESIDENT\
I am Rassilon the redeemer.\
Rassilon the resurrected. Gallifrey\
is mine!\
- but then suddenly the General is standing in front of him,\
interposing himself. He puts out his hand, gently but firmly\
lowers the President\'92s gauntleted arm. The President,\
incredulous, barely seems to resist.\

As Sky Tanks drone past below us, more and more weapons are\
thrown down ...\

A view of the night sky (no stars.) In the distance, from\

like a departing shuttle.\
Wider:\
The Doctor is watching from the top of a high tower (could be\
a redress of the tower top in 11.) The General and Gastron\
stand a respectful distance behind him.\
THE GENERAL\
Gallifrey is currently positioned\
at the extreme end of the time\

On one of the alcoves. We can just see, in the misty dimness,\
that it is occupied now. A tall, elongated figure, in Time\
Lord Headdress, almost lost in the shadow.\
Now, stepping out of the lift, the Doctor. He takes only a\
couple of paces from the lift, peers into the dimness of the\
cloisters. Cautious, curious.\
A voice from off:\
OHILA\
(From off)\
Old times?\
Ohila emerging from the shadows near the lift (not the\
cloister area itself.)\
THE DOCTOR\
You\'92re a long way from Karn.\
OHILA\
At the end of everything, you must\
expect the company of immortals.\
THE DOCTOR\
Do you know what they did to me?\
The Doctor pulls the confession dial from his coat, holds it\
up.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
A Confession Dial is a ritual act\
of purification. It allows a dying\
Time Lord to face his demons, and\
make his peace, before his mind is\
uploaded to the matrix.\
(Now, roaring out of him)\
It was never intended as a torture\
chamber for the living.\
His voice echoes round cloisters - the sound of his rage. The\
echoes die.\
OHILA\
Rassilon grew ...concerned.\
THE DOCTOR\
Afraid!\
OHILA\
He believed the Hybrid was the last\
remaining threat to the security of\
Gallifrey -\
THE DOCTOR\
To him.\
OHILA\
- and that it was a secret known\
only to you. You were entrapped and\
imprisoned at his command.\

Facing him, at the other end of the table, is the General.\
Some of his soldiers stand behind - he looks like he\'92s just\
been summoned.\
THE GENERAL\
Where is the High Council?\
THE DOCTOR\
Redeployed. Even Gallifrey needs a\
sanitation department.\
Now, Ohila entering, with a couple of her sisterhood.\
OHILA\
Interesting. Only a true aristocrat\
considers honest work a punishment.\
So far your Presidency is\
distressingly typical.\
She sits herself at the opposite end of the table. The Doctor\

Missed both his hearts and his\
brain stem - he\'92ll be up and about\
in no time.\
CLARA\
Is that what you\'92re telling\
yourself?\
THE DOCTOR\
It\'92s what\'92s true. Death is Time\
Lord for man-flu.\
CLARA\
It\'92s not funny!\
THE DOCTOR\
It\'92s a little bit funny -\
CLARA\
You are better than this!\
THE DOCTOR\
That was a long time ago.\
CLARA\
Was it? How long?\
On the Doctor: doesn\'92t want to get into that. He tosses his\
gun into the shadows.\
THE DOCTOR\
Happy?\
CLARA\
No. Tell me what a Neural Block is.\
THE DOCTOR\
Never mind, this way.\
CLARA\
What did you mean, human\
compatible?\
The Doctor isn\'92t listening - dragging Clara by the hand,\
deeper and deeper into the cloisters.\

of her memory.\
CLARA\
Of what?\
THE DOCTOR\
... of me.\
CUT TO:\
34 INT. CLOISTERS - DAY 34\
The Doctor and Clara, proceeding carefully and confidently\
through the cloisters.\
CLARA\
I thought you froze Gallifrey, in\
another dimension?\
THE DOCTOR\
Well they must have unfrozen and\
come back.\
CLARA\
How?\
THE DOCTOR\
I didn\'92t ask, it would make them\
feel clever.\
He\'92s looking back the way they came - tall figures flicker\
among the pillars and shadows.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
The Cloister Wraiths - Sliders, we\
used to call them. Don\'92t worry,\
they\'92ll leave us alone, we\'92re safe\
in here.\
CLARA\
Why?\
THE DOCTOR\
They only attack if you make any\
attempt to leave.\
CLARA\
How long are we planning to stay?\
THE DOCTOR\
Or, actually, if you try to stay.\
We let them go, off into the shadows.\
- and then, gliding from the alcoves, come the Sliders.\
Impossibly tall, robed -\

- but under the skullcap part of the headdress there is\
nothing.\
Just empty space ...\
Closing on one of those empty spaces, as the Slider glides\
past us. There is an electric crackle, and the space\
\'93fritzes\'94 like a television screen, and for a flickering\
moment there is the grainy, liney image of a screaming\
baleful face, all howling mouth and staring eyes...\
CUT TO:\
35 INT. EXTRACTION CHAMBER - DAY 35\
The Female General, Gastron, and Ohila gathered round a\
monitor. On it, a schematic of the cloisters, two glowing\
dots moving through.\
THE FEMALE GENERAL\
We need to block every exit from\
the Cloisters. Every available man,\
I need that place surrounded.\
GASTRON\
No one\'92s ever made it back out of\
the cloisters.\
OHILA\
Not quite nobody...\
CUT TO:\
36 INT. CLOISTERS - DAY 36\
A narrow corridor among the pillars and struts and alcoves.\
The Doctor leading Clara along. Dark and creepy here.\
THE DOCTOR\
This way, I\'92m fairly sure.\
According to the stories, there\'92s a\
secret way out ... if you find it,\
the Sliders let you go.\
They\'92re round a corner -\
- and big shock!!\
A Dalek, looming through the shadows, it\'92s headlights\
flashing as it speaks -\
DALEK\
Ex ... term ... in ... ate ...\
The Doctor and Clara, recoiling.\
THE DOCTOR\
It\'92s okay, look at it, look at it!\

On the Dalek. It is bound round and around by a eerie\
twisting of dark and clammy vines, clamping it against the\
wall. The Dalek itself is so decaying and ancient, it seems\
to be rusting into the brickwork. The gun stick is drooping,\
clearly damaged beyond repair.\
DALEK\
... me. Exterminate .... me ....\
CLARA\
Is it trapped?\
THE DOCTOR\
Those aren\'92t vines. In your terms,\
they\'92re fibre-optic cables, except\
they\'92re alive and growing. We\'92re\
inside the biggest database in\
history - sometimes people are\
stupid enough to break in.\
CLARA\
And?\
THE DOCTOR\
It\'92s a database - they get filed.\
The Dalek\'92s eyestalk focussing on them, almost visibly\
pleading.\
DALEK\
Exterminate ... me. Exterminate ...\
me.\
THE DOCTOR\
Probably a left-over from the\
cloister wars - we can\'92t help it.\
Come on.\
He takes her hand, leading her deeper into the shadows ...\
DALEK\
Exterminate ... me. Exterminate ...\
me.\
On Clara, wide-eyed as she makes her way among the horrors -\
Distantly, she can see some stone figures, bound in vines,\
grouped round a pillar -\
- as Clara walks on, another pillar momentarily blocks them\
from view -\
- and in that tiny moment, they\'92ve all moved!! Now revealed\
as Weeping Angels, trapped and bound in the vines. Their\
clawed hands reaching out, beseechingly, at Clara -\
- she hurries on, now passing man-shape, wrapped completely\
in vines, in alcove. It seems to turn its head as they pass.\
Closer - from among the vines, we can see the teardrop eyes\
of a Cyberman peering mournfully out.\

Clara, comes to a halt noticing -\
- and with savage suddenness, a steel hand erupts from the\
foliage, grasping horribly at Clara!\
The Doctor grabs her away.\
THE DOCTOR\
Keep away from them. All of them!\
He pulls her round a corner -\
- now emerging into a wider space: Among the pillars and\
struts, a fairly large section of floor, inlaid with\
intricate Gallifreyan symbols.\
The Doctor dashes towards this, kneels down, examines it,\
running his hands round the circles and indents.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Okay, this has got to be it.\
Clara is peering through the dimness - faintly, the gleam of\
a pair of lift doors, in the perimeter wall of the\
cloisters...\
CLARA\
There\'92s a lift over there...\
She takes a step towards it -\
- and there is angry whispering from the shadows.\
She looks around. Along pillars and shadows, the gliding\
shapes, crackle of their flickering faces...\
THE DOCTOR\
I wouldn\'92t. Any attempt to leave,\
you end up filed.\
Clara eyes the shifting, elongated shadows.\
CLARA\
What do you mean, database? How can\
this be a database?\
As the Doctor speaks, he\'92s darting round the floor mural -\
sonicing it with his glasses, touching and prodding various\
parts.\
THE DOCTOR\
When Time Lords die, their minds\
are uploaded to a thing called the\
matrix. This place, basically. Like\
a living computer - it can predict\
the future, generate prophecies out\
of algorithms, ring the cloister\
bells in the event of impending\
catastrophe. The Sliders are just\
like the guard dogs, or the\
firewall.\

Projections from inside the matrix\
itself - the dead, manning the\
battlements.\
CLARA\
... was I supposed to understand\
any of that?\
THE DOCTOR\
The Time Lords have a big computer\
made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded\
by more ghosts.\
CLARA\
Didn\'92t hurt, did it?\
THE DOCTOR\
Tiny bit.\
CLARA\
Why does a computer need to protect\
itself from the people who made it?\
THE DOCTOR\
All computers do that in the end -\
you wait till the internet starts.\
Oh, that was a war!\
Something clicks beneath his hands - ah! He\'92s getting\
somewhere.\

He got in here, disappeared for\
four days and then showed up in a\
completely different part of the\
city. Said the Sliders talked to\
him, showed him the secret passage\
out.\
CLARA\
What, and this kid told you the\
secret?\
THE DOCTOR\
He didn\'92t tell anyone anything.\
Went completely mad, never right in\
the head again. So they say.\
CLARA\
Okay, so that\'92s encouraging.\
THE DOCTOR\
Last I heard, he stole the moon and\
the President\'92s wife.\
He carries on working but those words land in Clara, hard.\
She stares at him. It was him. It was him. She suppresses a\
smile.\
CLARA\
Was she nice - the President\'92s\
wife?\
THE DOCTOR\
Yeah, well that was a lie put about\
by the Shabogans - it was the\
President\'92s daughter. And I didn\'92t\
steal the moon, I lost it -\
Breaks off. Realises. Stares at her.\
CLARA\
I\'92d know you anywhere.\
He holds her eyes for a moment, she starts to frown -\
- but he buries himself in his work again.\

I was a completely different person\

I was stuck. In a place. They were -\

Information - it doesn\'92t matter.\
Busies himself, working at the mural. Clara, studying him.\

What happened to your coat? Your\
velvety coat - I like that one, it\
was very Doctory.\
THE DOCTOR\
Yeah, changed it.\

Why?\
THE DOCTOR\
Can\'92t always be the Doctor. I think\
I\'92m nearly through, I think I\'92ve\

Open up, we\'92re going in. We\'92ll\

Some distance away we can see the Doctor still sitting on the\
floor. His head is now bowed, like he\'92s finished his story.\
Clara, kneeling opposite, has her back to us.\
The Female General gestures the soldiers forward, they\
proceed carefully out of the lift ...\
Sensing the movement behind her, Clara turns.\
Closer on her, as she does so. Her face is tear-streaked, she\
looks shocked beyond words - and so grim.\

Okay. The Hybrid - what is it?\
What\'92s so important, you would\
fight so long?\
He shakes his head - she\'92s not getting it.\
THE DOCTOR\
It doesn\'92t matter what the Hybrid\
is. It only mattered that I\
convinced them that I knew.\
Otherwise, they\'92d have kicked me\
out and I\'92d have nothing left to\
bargain with.\
CLARA\
... what were you bargaining for?\
The Doctor blinks. Surprise. Doesn\'92t she know?\
THE DOCTOR\
What do you think? You. I had to\
find a way of saving you.\
She stares at him. Awe-struck. This was all about her?\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
I knew it had to be the Time Lords.\
They cost you your life on Trap\
Street, Clara - and I was going to\
make them bring you back. All I had\
to do was hang in there for a bit.\
CLARA\
How long?\
THE DOCTOR\
Oh it was fine.\
Clearly he\'92s not going to tell her. She looks round to the\
little group of Time Lords.\
CLARA\
One question. And you will answer.\
How long was the Doctor trapped\
inside the confession dial?\
OHILA\
We think ... four and a half\
billion years.\
Clara just holds her look for a long moment. Just staring.\

Four and a half billion years...\

If she says so.\
CLARA\
Why would you even do that? I was\
dead already! I was dead and gone,\
Doctor, and you were in hell. Why\
would you do that to yourself??\
On the Doctor. He just looks faintly perplexed - a frown of\
almost childish puzzlement. Like he doesn\'92t understand why\
anyone would ask that question.\
THE DOCTOR\
I had a duty of care.\
On Clara\'92s face: that\'92s the moment that slays. Almost\
exhausts her. Just stares at him -\
- as he goes back to work on the mural.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Right, I\'92m nearly through - I\'92m\
pretty sure there\'92s a service duct\
under here, we can get to the old\
workshops. They\'92ll have TARDISes\
there -\

My time is up, Doctor. Between one\
heartbeat and the last, is all the\
time I have. People like you and\
me, there are things we should say\
to each other. And I\'92m going to say\
them now.\

Their POV: Clara, her back to us, talking. The Doctor, his\
head bowed, listening.\
Now: Clara is rising, to her feet. She turns, starts walking\
towards the Time Lords. Now she come to a halt at what seems\
to be the perimeter of the Cloisters. (We don\'92t make a fuss,\
but she is now blocking their view of the Doctor.)\
She looks at the Female General, for a moment. Such disdain.\
CLARA\
You are monsters.\
Silence. No response.\
CLARA (cont\'92d)\
Here you are - hiding away at the\
end of time. Do you even know why?\
Because you are hated. You are\
hated. By everybody. And by nobody\
more than me.\
OHILA\
What did you say to him?\
CLARA\
Nothing I\'92m sharing with you, or\
anyone else. Ever. Except, maybe\
this part. I said \'93Don\'92t worry -\

what is the Doctor going to do now?\

Nowhere in space, forward in time.\

A terrible silence. Clara just staring at him - did he listen\
to what he just said??\
The Doctor: his face falling slightly. Yeah, he did listen to\
that.\
And then, very lightly, there is a knock at the TARDIS door.\
Not loud and boom like in Listen - just a light tapping, like\
a neighbour popping round for sugar. Four taps.\
They both stare at the doors. What? What??\
CLARA\
... How can there be anyone out\
there?\
Again, four light taps.\
THE DOCTOR\
Four knocks. It\'92s always four.\
He operates the door control, and the TARDIS doors swing\
open. (This being the classic TARDIS, the doors are larger\
and don\'92t resemble police box doors.) Outside is all shadows.\
The Doctor: haunted, almost defeated - but so curious. He\
sets the Neural Block down on the console, starts towards the\
door.\

Instinctively, Clara makes to follow.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
No, please. This one I do alone.\
CLARA\
What\'92s out there?\
THE DOCTOR\
Me.\
Clara\'92s face: what??\
The Doctor is stepping out the doors. Clara, watching him go,\
reluctant -\
- and her eyes go to the Neural Block sitting on the console.\
What is that?\
CUT TO:\
46 INT. CLOISTERS (ANCIENT) - NIGHT 46\
The Doctor steps from the Cylinder TARDIS. A huge, darkened\
chamber - vast, echoing. Just recognisable as the Cloisters,\
now ruined and impossibly ancient.\
Silent.\
One new addition. A little way from him, there is a wing\
armchair, set in the middle of the chamber, opposite a little\
coffee table and another identical armchair.\
One armchair has its back to us.\
On the Doctor\'92s face: grim, resigned. What he expected. He\
now walks towards the chairs, talking as he goes.\
THE DOCTOR\
I told you once, so long ago, that\
you\'92d find the universe a very\
small place when I\'92m angry with\
you.\
He now turns, facing the chair\'92s occupant. Cold.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Small enough for you yet?\
In the chair, Ashildr, looking at him. Outwardly she\'92s the\
same girl we always knew. But you can tell, at a glance, that\
she is now so different. Serene, wise, a soul so very, very\
old.\
THE DOCTOR (cont\'92d)\
Hello Me.\
And they smile at each other. The anger long forgotten.\

ASHILDR\
You don\'92t seem surprised to see me.\
She gestures the Doctor to the other chair. He sits in it.\
THE DOCTOR\
At the end of everything, one must\
expect the company of immortals -\
so I\'92m told.\
ASHILDR\
Even the other immortals are gone.\
It\'92s just me.\
THE DOCTOR\
The one and only Me. Finally, you\
earn the title - sitting in a\
reality bubble at the end of time\
itself. How are you sustaining it,\
by the way?\
ASHILDR\
Brilliantly. I\'92ve been watching the\
stars die. It was beautiful.\
THE DOCTOR\
No. It was sad.\
ASHILDR\
No. It was both. But that\'92s not\
something you would understand, is\
it? You don\'92t like endings.\
Ashildr\'92s glance round - in the ruins of the cloisters, we\
can see the Sliders flickering about.\
ASHILDR (cont\'92d)\
We\'92re on the last fragment of\
Gallifrey. The Time Lord matrix is\
guttering, but the ghosts still\
walk. They tell me stories\
sometimes ...\
(Looks to the Doctor)\
... of the little boy who didn\'92t\
know how to give up.\
The Doctor, just looking stonily at her.\
ASHILDR (cont\'92d)\
She died, Doctor. Clara died,\
billions of years ago.\
THE DOCTOR\
You killed her.\
ASHILDR\
No.\
THE DOCTOR\
You let it happen.\

She did. She died for who she was,\

beautiful, and it is over. We have\
no right to change who she was.\
THE DOCTOR\
Ashildr -\
ASHILDR\
Me.\
THE DOCTOR\
Me. Go to hell.\
(Stands)\
By my calculations, you have about\
five minutes.\
He starts striding for the Cylinder TARDIS.\
ASHILDR\
Do you know why we run, Doctor?\
THE DOCTOR\
Because it\'92s fun!\
ASHILDR\
Because we know summer can\'92t last\
forever.\
THE DOCTOR\
(Rounds on her)\
Yeah, it can. Of course it can. You\
just have to steal a time machine.\
His hand on the door, about to enter the TARDIS.\
ASHILDR\
The Hybrid.\
This freezes him. Looks back at Ashildr.\
ASHILDR (cont\'92d)\
Five minutes to hell. It\'92s time to\
tell the truth.\

You broke in here, and the Wraiths\
spoke to you. They told you about\
the Hybrid. Why did that story make\
you so scared?\
THE DOCTOR\
I don\'92t know. I don\'92t remember it.\
ASHILDR\
You do sometimes. Always the way\
with the things we\'92d rather forget.\
You remember now, don\'92t you?\
On the Doctor\'92s face. Saying nothing. Stony.\
ASHILDR (cont\'92d)\
Who is the Hybrid, Doctor? Who\
threatens all of time and space?\

Oh, that\'92s easy. That\'92s very, very\
easy. It\'92s you. The Hybrid is you.\

THE DOCTOR\
No it isn\'92t. The actual prophecy\
specifies only two warrior races.\
The Daleks and the Time Lords made\
assumptions, of course - but then,\
they would. Humans and the Mire,\
both warrior races, fits perfectly.\
ASHILDR\
It\'92s an interesting theory.\
THE DOCTOR\
Do you have a better one?\
ASHILDR\
By your own reasoning, why couldn\'92t\
the Hybrid be half Time Lord ...\
half human?\
On the Doctor. Stiffens in his chair. A nerve, struck.\
ASHILDR (cont\'92d)\
Tell me, Doctor, I\'92ve always wanted\
to know - you\'92re a Time Lord,\
you\'92re a high born Gallifreyan. Why\
do you spend so much time on Earth?\
On the Doctor: a pause. A long pause. Then he simply laughs.\
THE DOCTOR\
That\'92s your best theory? I\'92m the\
Hybrid. I ran from Gallifrey\
because I was frightened of myself?\
That doesn\'92t make any sense.\
ASHILDR\
It makes perfect sense, and you\
know it. Am I right? Is it true?\
THE DOCTOR\
Does it matter?\
ASHILDR\
No. Because I have a better theory.\

Really?\

Now the same thought impacts on both the Doctor and Clara at\

doing.\
ASHILDR\
And what would that be?\
Clara, listening in mounting alarm.\
THE DOCTOR\
I\'92m going to put her back on Earth.\
Somewhere safe, out of the way. I\'92m\
going to wipe every last detail of\
me from her memory. It will be like\
our friendship never happened.\
Clara eyes wide in shock. No. No!!\
ASHILDR\
That may not be what she wants.\
THE DOCTOR\
It\'92s the safest way - I\'92ve done\
this before, it works. Usually, I\'92d\
do it telepathically, but I\'92ve got\
something better this time.\
Clara\'92s eyes go to the Neural Block on the console, snatches\
it up.\

It will be quite painless.\

The screen goes blank.\
She looks at the Neural Block in her hand. What is she going\
to do?? Hide it? Destroy it? How?\
New thought. She pops the sonic glasses back on, presses the\
button, while staring at the Neural Block. The sonic buzzes.\
- just as the doors start to open. Quickly she puts the block\
and the glasses back on the console.\
In comes the Doctor. He frowns at her - she\'92s clearly\
flustered.\
THE DOCTOR\
You okay?\
CLARA\
Yes. Yes, of course. Just, you\

We\'92ll fix that. Somehow. I promise.\

ear.\

DW9: "Episode 12" by Steven Moffat - GREEN AMENDS - 17/08/15.\
BBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL 62\
At the top of the staircases, a coat stand - and hanging on\
it, what appears to be his velvet coat (or a close match.)\
Panning to the blackboard next to it. Chalked on it, the\
familiar words:\
RUN YOU CLEVER BOY.\
Panning down to:\
AND BE A DOCTOR.\
The Doctor ascends the stairs to the blackboard. Looks at\
those words. Now he shucks off his dusty coat, tosses it.\
Pulls on the velvet coat.\
Adjusts it, pats it into place. Yep, that\'92s him.\
Now a pneumatic hiss from the console. A bleeping. And\
something fires out of the console, and somersaults through\
the air to the Doctor.\
He catches it in his hand. A brand new, restyled, sonic\
screwdriver!\
He looks at it in his hand smiles. Now he clicks his fingers.\
The TARDIS doors slam shut.\
The Doctor slips his new sonic into his pocket, heads down\
the stairs to his console. Slams the lever.\
The room lurches, the engines roar -\
CUT TO:\
60 EXT. DESERT - DAY 60\
The TARDIS starts to dematerialise. As it does, the painted\
murals all seem to melt, to run - as if being discarded as\
the police box disappears.\
On Clara\'92s face, melting away.\
The paint all flutters to the ground, as the TARDIS roars\
away on its next adventure!\

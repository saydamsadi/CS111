\f0\b\fs38 \cf2 PROLOGUE 
\f1\b0\fs28 \
We should start back,\'94 Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. \'93The wildlings are dead.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Do the dead frighten you?\'94 Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. \'93Dead is dead,\'94 he said. \'93We have no business with the dead
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Are they dead?\'94 Royce asked softly. \'93What proof have we?\'94\
\'93Will saw them,\'94 Gared said. \'93If he says they are dead, that\'92s proof enough for 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e.\'94 \
Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. \'93My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,\'94 he pu
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  in. \
\'93My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\'94 Royce replied. \'93Never believe anything you hear at a woman\'92s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\'94 His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rest. \
\'93We have a long ride before us,\'94 Gared pointed out. \'93Eight days, maybe nine. And night is fa
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ling.\'94 \
Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \'93It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Gared?\'94 \
Will could see the tightness around Gared\'92s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night\'92s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to fear. \
Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ngings by \
now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terro
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s for him. \
Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  commander. \
Especially not a commander l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ke this one. \
Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night\'92s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as concerned. \
His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \'93Bet he killed them all himself, he did,\'94 Gared told the barracks over wine, \'93twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\'94 They had all sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 red the laugh. \
It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  felt the same. \
\'93Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,\'94 Gared said. \'93They\'92re dead. They shan\'92t trouble us no more. There\'92s hard riding before us. I don\'92t like this weather. If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow\'92s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 storm, my lord?\'94 \
The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half- bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. \'93Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. L
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ave nothing out.\'94 \
Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night\'92s Watch. Well, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  poacher in truth. \
Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters\'92 own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters\'92 own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 iscover his talent. \
\'93The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,\'94 Will said. \'93I got close as I dared. There\'92s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow\'92s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  ever lay so still.\'94 \
\'93D
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d you see any blood?\'94 \
\'93We
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l, no,\'94 Will admitted. \
\'93D
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d you see any weapons?\'94 \
\'93Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him, right by his hand.\'94 \
\'93Did you make note of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  position of the bodies?\'94 \
Will shrugged. \'93A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the ground. Fallen, like.\'94 \
\'93Or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sleeping,\'94 Royce suggested. \
\'93Fallen,\'94 Will insisted. \'93There\'92s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches. A far-eyes.\'94 He smiled thinly. \'93I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn\'92t moving neither.\'94 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 espite himself, he shivered. \
\'93You have a chill?\'94 Royce asked.\
\'93Some,\'94 Wil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  muttered. \'93The wind, m\'92lord.\'94 \
The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce\'92s destrier moved restlessly. \'93What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\'94 Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  drape of his long sable cloak. \
\'93It was the cold,\'94 Gared said with iron certainty. \'93I sa
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  men freeze last winter, and the \
one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don\'92t have the strength to fight it. It\'92s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don\'92t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it\'92s like sinking into a 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.\'94 \
\'93Such eloquence, Gared,\'94 Ser Waymar observed. \'93I 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ever suspected you had it in you.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ve had the cold in me too, lordling.\'94 Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. \'93Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s watch, with a smile on his face.\'94 \
Ser Waymar shrugged. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\'94 \
Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. \'93We\'92ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\'94 He pulled up his hood and hunch
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d over his garron, silent and sullen. \
\'93If Gared said it was the cold . . . \'94 Will began. \'93Have you d
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 awn any watches this past week, Will?\'94 \
\'93Yes, m\'92lord.\'94 There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 y watches. What was the man drivi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g at? \
\'93And how did you find the Wall?\'94 \
\'93Weeping,\'94 Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \'93They couldn\'92t have froze. Not if the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Wall was weeping. It wasn\'92t cold enough.\'94 \
Royce nodded. \'93Bright lad. We\'92ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\'94 The knight\'92s smile was cocksure. \'93Will, lead us the
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e. I would see these dead men for myself.\'94 \
And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d been given, and honor bound them to obey. \
Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up the rear. The ol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode. \
Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to black. The stars began to come out. A ha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light. \
\'93We can make a better pace than this, su
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ely,\'94 Royce said when the moon was full risen. \
\'93Not with this horse,\'94 Will said. Fear had made him insolent
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93Perhaps my lord would care to take the lead?\'94 \
Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply.\
Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled.\
Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted. \'93Why are you stopping?\'94 Ser Waymar asked.\
\'93Best go the rest of 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he way on foot, m\'92lord. It\'92s just over that ridge.\'94 \
Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through the trees. His great s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ble cloak stirred behind like something half- alive. \
\'93There\'92s something wrong here,\'94 Gared muttered.\
The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \'93Is there?\'94 \'93Can
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 t you feel it?\'94 Gared asked. \'93Listen to the darkness.\'94 \
Will could feel it. Four years in the Nigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it? \
\'93Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\'94 When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ook of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. \
\'93The trees press close here,\'94 Will warned
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93That sword will tangle you up, m\'92lord. Better a knife.\'94 \
\'93If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the young lord said. \'93Gared, stay here. Guard the ho
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ses.\'94 \
Gared dismounted. \'93We need a fire. I\'92ll see to it.\'94 \
\'93How big a fool are you, old man? If there
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\'94 \
\'93There\'92s some enemies a fire will keep away,\'94 Gared 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. \'93Bears and direwolves and . . . and other thi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 gs . . . \'94 \
Ser Waymar\'92s mouth became a hard line. \'93No fire.\'94 \
Gared\'92s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron b
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 b for the lordling\'92s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard. \
Finally
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Gared looked down. \'93No fire,\'94 he muttered, low under his breath. \
Royce too
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  it for acquiescence and turned away. \'93Lead on,\'94 he said to Will. \
Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, slick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling\'92s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as reaching branch
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak. \
The great sentinel wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would \
be, its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the snow and the mud, and looked down on the empty clearing below. \
His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lf-frozen stream. Everything was just as i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  had been a few hours ago. \
They were gone. All the bodies were gone. \
\'93Gods!\'94 he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m as 
\f3 the w
\f1 ind came up, outlined nobly against the stars for all to see. \
\'93Get down!\'94 Will whispered urgently. \'93Something\'92s wrong.\'94\
Royce 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 id not move. He looked down at the e
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 pty clearing and laughed. \'93Your dead \
men seem to have moved camp, Will.\'94 \
Will\'92s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed battle-ax
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . . \
\'93On your feet, Will,\'94 Ser W
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ymar commanded. \'93There\'92s n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  one here. I won\'92t have you hiding under a bush.\'94 \
Reluctantly, Will obeyed. \
Ser Waymar looked him over with open disa
\f3 pprov
\f1 al. \'93I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging. We will find th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 se men.\'94 He glanced around. \'93Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a fire.\'94 \
Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his teeth to keep bot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort. \
Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, \'93Who goes there?\'94 Will 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eard uncertainty in the challenge. He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. \
The woods gave answe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 : the rustle of leaves, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. \
The Others made no sound. \
Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, scratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a reflection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all? \
\'93Will, where are you?\'94 Ser Waymar called up. \'93Can you see anything?\'94 He was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have fe
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 t t
\f3 hem,
\f1  as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. \'93Answer me! Why is it so cold?\'94 \
It was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed har
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. \
A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep gre
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 -green of the trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took. \
Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. \'93Come no farther,\'94 the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy\'92s. He threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders, to free his ar
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 s for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had stopped. It was very cold. \
The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a ghost
\f2\fs24 -
\f1\fs28 light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. \
Ser Waymar met him bravely. \'93Dance with me then.\'94 He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night\'92s Watch. \
The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s, a blue that burned like ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 gh, watched the \
moonlight running cold along the metal. For a heartbeat he dared to hope. \
They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of\
them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had to call out. It w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s his duty. And his death, if he did. He shiver
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence. \
The pale sword came shivering through the air. \
Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a s
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 cond blow, and a third, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. \
Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ir delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to interfere. \
Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 eaming in the moonlight. His blade was white with frost; the Other\'92s danced with pale blue light. \
Then Royce\'92s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they tou
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hed the snow. Ser Waymar\'92s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red. \
The Other said something in a language that Wil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking. \
Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. \'93For Robert!\'94 he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swingin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  it around in a flat sidearm slash with all hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  weight behind it. The Other\'92s parry was almost lazy. \
When the blades touched, the steel shattered. \
A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 tween his fingers. \
The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose \
and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t were silk. Will closed his eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 cicles. \
When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty. \
He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 lowly across the black sky. Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down. \
Royce\'92s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy. \
He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then 
\f2\fs24 s

BRAN \
The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord fat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er and his brothers to see the king\'92s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\'92s life. \
The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\'92s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half- human children. \
But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\'92s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night\'92s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. \
The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\'92d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field. \
Bran\'92s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e children of the forest. He had taken off Father\'92s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. \
There were questions asked and answers given t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ere in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave \
a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. \'93Ice,\'94 that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\'92s hand, and tal
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 er even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel. \
His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \'93In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.\'94 He lifted the greatsword high above his head. \
Bran\'92s bastard 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 rother Jon Snow moved closer. \'93Keep the pony well in han
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 he whispered. \'93And don\'92t look away. Father will know if you do.\'94 \
Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. \
His father took off the man\'92s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rom bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. \
The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\'92s feet. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 heon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \
\'93Ass,\'94 Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\'92s should
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \'93You did well,\'94 Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice. \
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was hi
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 her in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses. \
\'93The deserter died bravely,\'94 Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ith his mother\'92s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \'93He had courage, at the least.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Jon Snow said quietly. \'93It was not co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\'94 Jon\'92s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but \
there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look ali
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his hal
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  brother was strong and fast. \
Robb was not impressed. \'93The Others take his eyes,\'94 he swore. \'93He died well. Race you to the bridge?\'94 \
\'93Done,\'94 Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 f down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went. \
Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 gged man\'92s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\'92s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again. \
So deep in thought was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. \'93Are you well, Bran?\'94 he asked, not unkindly. \
\'93Yes, Father,\'94 Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \'93Robb says the man died brave
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y, but Jon says he was afraid.\'94 \
\'93What do you think?\'94 his father asked.\
Bran thought about it. \'93C
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n a man still be brave if he\'92s afraid?\'94 \
\'93That is the only time a man can be brave,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  his father told him. \'93Do you understand why I did it?\'94 \
\'93He was a wildling,\'94 Bran said. \'93They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\'94 \
His lord father smiled. \'93Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\'92s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if 
\f3 he
\f1  is taken, so
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The qu
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 stion was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\'94 \
Bran had no answer for that. \'93King Robert has a headsman,\'94 he said, uncertainly. \
\'93He does,\'94 his father admitted. \'93As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you \
would take a man\'92s life, 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die. \
\'93One day, Bran, you will be Robb\'92s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day co
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 es, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind pai
\f3 d executioners soon forgets what death is.\'94 \
That w
\f1 as when Jon reappeared on 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he crest of the hill before them. He waved and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shouted down at them. \'93Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\'94 Then he was gone again. \
Jory rode up beside them. \'93Trouble, my lord?\'94 \
\'93Beyond a doubt,\'94 his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lord father said. \'93Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\'94 He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after. \
They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices. \
The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \'93Gods!\'94 he exclaimed, struggling to 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 eep control of his horse as he reached for his sword. \
Jory\'92s sword was already out. \'93Robb, get away from 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t!\'94 he called as his horse reared under him. \
Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \'93She can\'92t hurt you,\'94 he said. \'93She\'92s dead, Jory.\'94 \
Bran was afire with c
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 riosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approa
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 h on foot. Bran jumped of
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  and ran. \
By then Jon, Jory, and The
\f3 on Gr
\f1 eyjoy had all dismounted as well. \'93What in the seven hells is it?\'94 Greyjoy was saying. \
\'93A wo
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f,\'94 Robb told hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 . \
\'93A freak,\'94 Greyjoy said. \'93Look at the size of it.\'94\
Bran\'92s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his \
brothers\'92 side. \
Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\'92s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\'92s kennel. \
\'93It\'92s no freak,\'94 Jon said cal
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ly. \'93That\'92s a direwolf. They g
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ow larger than the other kind.\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy said, \'93There\'92s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\'94 \
\'93I see one now,\'94 Jon replied. \
Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb\'92s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey- black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb\'92s chest a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \'93Go on,\'94 Robb told him. \'93You can touch him.\'94 \
Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \'93Here you go.\'94 His half brother
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 put a second pup into his arms. \'93There are five of them.\'94 Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  his face. Its fur was soft
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and warm against his cheek. \
\'93Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\'94 muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \'93I like it not.\'94 \
\'93It is a sign,\'94 Jory said. \
Fath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r frowned. \'93This is only a dead animal, Jory,\'94 he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. \'93
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 o we know what killed her?\'94 \
\'93There\'92s something in the throat,\'94 Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. \'93There, just under the jaw.\'94 \
His fat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er knelt and groped under the beast\'92s head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood. \

\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28  sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not u
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 derstand. \
His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \'93I\'92m surprised she l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ved long enough to whelp,\'94 he said. His voice broke the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 pell. \
\'93Maybe she didn\'92t,\'94 Jory said. \'93I\'92ve heard tales .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . maybe the bitch was already dead
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 when the pups came.\'94 \
\'93Born with the dead,\'94 another man put in. \'93Worse luck.\'94 \
\'93No matter,\'94 s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id Hullen. \'93They be dead soon enough too.\'94 \
Bran gave a wordless cry o
\f3 f d
\f1 ismay. \
\'93The sooner the better,\'94 Theon 
\f2\fs24 G
\f1\fs28 reyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \'93Give the beast here, Bran.\'94 \
The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \'93No!\'94 Bran cried out fier
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ely. \'93It\'92s mine.\'94 \
\'93Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\'94 Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eir father, like the lord he would someday be. \'93We will keep these pups.\'94 \
\'93You cannot do that, boy,\'94 said Harwin, who was Hullen\'92s son. \'93It be a mercy to kill them,\'94 Hulle
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  
\f3 sai
\f1 d. \
Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \'93Hullen speaks truly, s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ry in front of his father. \
Robb resisted stubb
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rnly. \'93Ser Rodrik\'92s red bitch whelped again last week,\'94 he said. \'93It was a small litter, only two live pups. She\'92ll have milk enough.\'94 \
\'93She\'92ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\'94 \
\'93Lord Stark,\'94 Jon 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \'93There are five pups,\'94 he told Father. \'93Three male, two female.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 hat of it, Jon?\'94 \
\'93You have five trueborn children,\'94 Jon said. \'93Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\'94 \
Bran saw his father\'92s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, includ
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that c
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 stom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ir own. \
Their father understood as well. \'93You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\'94 he asked softly. \
\'93The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\'94 Jon pointed out. \'93I am no Stark, Father.\'94 \
Their
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lord father regarded Jo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \'93I will nurse him myself, Father,\'94 he promised. \'93I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\'94 \
\'93Me too!\'94 Bran echoed. \
The lord weighed his sons long 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd carefully with his eyes. \'93Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 servants\'92 time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?\'94 \
Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue. \
\'93You must train them as well,\'94 their father said. \'93You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r train them badly. These 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 re not dogs to beg f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l rip a man\'92s arm off his shoulder as e
\f3 asil
\f1 y as a dog 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ill kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\'94 \
\'93Yes, Father,\'94 Bran said. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Robb agreed. \
\'93
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\'94 \
\'93They won\'92t die,\'94 Robb said. \'93We won\'92t let them die.\'94 \
\'93Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It\'92s time we were back to Winterfell.\'94 \
It was not until they were mounted and on the
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ir of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 inside his leathers, 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 arm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him. \
Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. \
\'93What is it, Jon?\'94 their lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  father asked. \
\'93Can\'92t you hear it?\'94 \
Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else. \
\'93There,\'94 Jon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said. He swung his horse around and galloped back acros
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. \
\'93He must have crawled away from the others,\'94 Jon said. \
\'93Or been driven away,\'94 their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. \
\'93An a

Jon Snow gave his father\'92

CATELYN \
Catelyn had never liked this godswood. \
She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red F
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rk of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. \
The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks cr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names. \
But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man\'92s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood. \
Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the sme
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. \
For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 aces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. \
At the center of the grove an anci
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. \'93The heart tree,\'94 Ned called it. The weirwood\'92s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been \
carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ey had watched the castle\'92s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea. \
In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. \
Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \'93Ned,\'94 she called softly. \
He lifted his head to look at her. \'93Catelyn,\'94 he said. His voice was distant and formal. \'93Where are the children?\'94 \
He would always ask her that. \'93In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\'94 She spread her cloak on the fore
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \'93Arya is already in love, and Sansa is c
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 armed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\'94 \
\'93Is he afraid?\'94 Ned asked.\
\'93A little,\'94 she admitted. \'93He is only three.\'94 \
Ned frowned. \'93He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a
\f3  chill, as they 
\f1 always did. The Stark words. Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  what a strange people these northerners were. \
\'93The man died we
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l, I\'92ll give him that,\'94 Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \
\'93I was glad for Bran\'92s sake. You would have been proud of Bran.\'94 \
\'93I am always proud of Bran,\'94 Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North. \
\'93He was the fourth this year,\'94 Ned said grimly. \'93The poor man was half-ma
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . Something had put a fear in him 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 o deep that my words could not reach him.\'94 He sighed. \'93Ben writes that the strength of the Night\'92s Watch is down below a thousand. It\'92s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.\'94 \
\'93Is it the wildlings?\'94 she asked. \
\'93Wh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  else?\'94 Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \'93And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.\'94 \
\'93Beyond the Wall?\'94 The thought made Catelyn shudder.\
Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  saw the dread on her face. \'93Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\'94 \
\'93There are darker things beyond the Wall.\'94 She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thought
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . \
His smile was gentle. \'93You listen to too many of Old Nan\'92s stories. The Others are as d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ad as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.\'94 \
\'93Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\'94 Cate
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 yn reminded him. \
\'93I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\'94 he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. \'93You did not come here to tell me 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 rib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?\'94 \
Cat
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lyn took her husband\'92s hand. \'93There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.\'94 There was no way to soften the \
blow, so she told him straight. \'93I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\'94 \
His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a se
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ond father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and- falcon banners in revo
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 t rather than give up those he had pledged to 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 rotect. \
And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. \
\'93Jon . . . \'94 he said. \'93Is this n
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ws certain?\'94 \
\'93It was the king\'92s seal, and the letter is in Robert\'92s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brou
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.\'94 \
\'93That is some small mercy, I suppose,\'94 he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. \'93Your sister,\'94 he said. \'93And Jon\'92s boy. What word of them?\'94 \
\'93The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Catelyn said. \'93I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it was ever her husband\'92s place, not hers. Lord Jon\'92s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the comfort of family and friends around her.\'94 \
\'93Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I\'92d heard.\'94 \
Catelyn nodded. \'93Brynden will do what he can fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . . \'94 \
\'93Go to her,\'94 Ned urged. \'93Take the children. Fill her 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 alls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\'94 \
\'93Would that I could,\'94 Catelyn said
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93The lett
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.\'94 \
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \'93Robert is coming here?\'94 When she nodded, a smile broke across \
his face. \
Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the s
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \'93I knew that would please you,\'94 she said. \'93We should send word to your brother on the Wall.\'94 \
\'93Yes, of course,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  he agreed. \'93Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird.\'94 Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \'93Damnation, how many y
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ars has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\'94 \
\'93I should thin
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.\'94 \
\'93Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\'94 he said. \'93It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare.\'94 \
\'93The queen\'92s brothers are also in the party,\'94 she told him. \
Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen\'92s family, Catelyn knew. The Lann
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 sters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert\'92s cau
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. \'93Well, if the price for Robert\'92s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\'94 \
\'93Where the king goes, the realm follows,\'94 she said. \
\'93It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the L
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nnister woman\'92s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\'94 \
\'93Prince Tommen is seven,\'94 she told him. \'93The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\'94 \
Ned squeezed her hand. \'93There must be 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1 \cf3  feast, o\cf2 f \cf3 course, with singe\cf2 rs\cf3 , and

DAENERYS \
Her brother held the gown up for her inspection.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\'94 \
Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \'93Is it really mine?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 \
\'93A gift 
\f1 from the Magister Illyrio,\'94 Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \'93The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\'94 \
A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. \'93Why does he give us so m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ch?\'94 she asked. \'93What does he want from us?\'94 For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister\'92s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 eldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. \
\'93Illyrio is no fool,\'94 Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. \'93The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\'94 \
Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he\'92d never had a friend he woul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 n\'92t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it \'93waking the dragon.\'94 \
Her brother hung the gown beside the door. \'93Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount.\'94 He studied her critically. \'93You 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 till slouch. Straighten yourself\'94 He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. \'93Let them see that you have a woman\'92s shape now.\'94 His
\f3  finger
\f1 s brushed light
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y over her budding breas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 s and tightened on a nipple. \'93You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. \
You don\'92t want to wake the dragon, do you?\'94 His fingers twisted her,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. \'93Do you?\'94 he repeated. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany said meekly. \
Her brother smiled. \'93Good.\'94 He touched her hair, almost with affection. \'93When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\'94 \
When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 it their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo\'92s manse. \
Somewhere beyon
\f3 d the sunset, 
\f1 across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad a simpler name. \'93Our land,\'94 he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \'93Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\'94 \
And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Ro
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King\'92s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother\'92s womb. \
Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship\'92s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King\'92s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper\'92s dogs, the lords Lannister and Star
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 . Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar\'92s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father\'92s throat with a golden sword. \
She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her. \
She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper\'92s brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It woul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast. \
She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her \'93Little Princess\'94 and sometimes \'93My Lady,\'94 and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m forever. \
They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\'92s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one. \
At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eir lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother\'92s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother \'93the beggar king.\'94 Dany did not want to know what they called her. \
\'93We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\'94 he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. \'93The jewels and the silks,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Dragonstone and King\'92s Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\'94 Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known. \
There came a soft knock on her door. \'93Come,\'94 Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio\'92s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister\'92s many Dothraki
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio\'92s favorite, a fair- haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked. \
They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany\'92s head and helpe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. \'93Ours is the house of the dragon,\'94 he would say. \'93
\f3 The fire
\f1  is in our blood.\'94 \
The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back an
\f3 d her
\f1  feet and told her how lucky she was. \'93Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\'94 There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ld her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian. \
When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum sil
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amet
\f3 hysts arou
\f1 nd her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs. \
\'93Now you look all a princess,\'94 the girl said
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 breathlessly when they were done. 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 any glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 chill, and \
gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. \
Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \'93Stand there,\'94 he told her. \'93Turn around. Yes. Good. You look . . . \'94 \
\'93Regal,\'94 Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. \'93May the Lord of Light sh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wer you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\'94 the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. \'93She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\'94 he told her brother. \'93Drogo will be enraptured.\'94 \
\'93She\'92s too skinny,\'94 Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as her
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , had been pulled back tightly behind his head and
\f3  fas
\f1 tened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, \'93Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\'94 \
\'93She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal,\'94 Illyrio told him, not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 for the first time. \'93Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . and highborn, dau
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Drogo.\'94 When he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. \
\'93I suppose,\'94 her brother said doubtfully. \'93The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . . \'94 \
\'93Best not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 suggest this to Khal Drogo,\'94 Illyrio said. \
Anger flashed in her brother\'92s lilac eyes. \'93Do you take me for a fool?\'94 \
The magister bowed slightly. \'93I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I have given offense.\'94 He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers. \
The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut in Illyrio\'92s elaborately carved palanq
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 in. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men h
\f3 oisted t
\f1 he poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio\'92s \
pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. \
Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the narrow sea. \'93We won\'92t need his whole khalasar,\'94 Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \'93Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki scr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 amers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.\'94 He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \'93They do, don\'92t they?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93They are your people, and they love you well,\'94 Magister Illyrio said amiably. \'93In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.\'94 He gave a massive shrug. \'93Or so my agents tell me.\'94 \
Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ea, but she mistrusted Illyrio\'92s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. \'93I shall kill the Usurper myself,\'94 he promised, who had never killed anyone, \'93as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e did to my father.\'94 \
\'93That would be most fitting,\'94 Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips
\f3 , but
\f1  her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. \
The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m. The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords. \'93It is not that we fear these barbarians,\'94 Illyrio would explain with a smile. \'93The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\'94 \
Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Mag
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ster Illyrio growled something to him in the rough Doth
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 aki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates. \
Dany noticed that her brot
\f3 her\'92s
\f1  hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He looked almost as frightened as she felt. \'93Insol
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt eunuch,\'94 Viserys \
muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse. \
Magister Illyrio\'92s words were honey. \'93Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.\'94 \
\'93Oh, yes,\'94 Viserys said darkly. \'93He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep ea
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 y while I live.\'94 \
The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. \
Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \'93Viserys of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,\'94 he called in a high, sweet voice, \'93King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\'94 \
They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. Yet among th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ealized, with a sudden start of fear, that 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he was the only woman there. \
Illyrio whispered to them. \'93Those three are Drogo\'92s bloodriders, there,\'94 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e said. \'93By the pillar is Khal Moro, w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\'94 \
The last name caught Daenerys. \'93A knight?\'94 \
\'93No less.\'94 Illyrio smiled through his beard. \'93Anointed wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\'94 \
\'93What is he doing here?\'94 she blurted. \
\'93The Usurper wanted his head,\'94 Illyrio told them. \'93Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night\'92s Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.\'94 \
\'93I shall wish to speak with Ser J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rah before the night is done,\'94 her brother said. Dany found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, 
\f3 he wo
\f1 re wool an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs. \
She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er bare shoulder. \'93Over there, sweet princess,\'94 he whispered, \'93there is the khal himself.\'94 \
Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done. \
The slave girl had not 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 een far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet some
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio\'92s m
\f3 enag
\f1 erie. He was younger than she\'92d thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings. \
\'93I must go and make my submissions,\'94 Magister Illyrio said. \'93Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\'94 \
Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt. \'93Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\'94 \
Drogo\'92s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ven his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs. \
\'93You see how long it is?\'94 Viserys said. \'93When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come a
\f3 gain, 
\f1 and you will be his queen.\'94 \
Dany looked
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at Khal
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 D
\f3 rogo.
\f1  His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her. \'93I don\'92t want to be his queen
\f3 ,\'94 she heard herself s
\f1 ay in a small, thin voice. \'93Please, please, Viserys, I don\'92t want to, I want to go \
home
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Home?\'94 He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \'93How are we to go home, sweet sister? They took our home from us!\'94 He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. \'93How are we to go home?\'94 he repeated, meaning King\'92s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the realm they had lost. \
Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 o\'92s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door had not been home for him. His fingers d
\f3 ug hard i
\f1 nto her arm, demanding an answer. \'93I don\'92t know . . . \'94she said at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. \
\'93I do,\'94 he said sharply. \'93We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo\'92s army, that is how we go home. And if you must we
\f3 d hi
\f1 m and bed him for
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that, you will.\'94 He smiled at her. \'93I\'92d let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army. Be 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 rateful it is only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and he will not see you crying.\'94 \
Dany turned and saw that it was 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 rue. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bo
\f2\fs24 w
\f1 \cf3 s, was es\cf2 co\cf3 rting Khal Drogo o\cf2 ve\cf3 r to 
\f2 \cf2 w
\f1 \cf3 here they\cf2  s\cf3 tood. She brushed \cf2 aw\cf3 ay un
\f2 \cf2 f
\f0\b\fs38 allen t
\f2\b0\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ars with the back of her hand. \
\'93Smile,\'94 Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \'93And stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\'94 \
Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight. \

EDDARD \
The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the north
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rn wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon. \
Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown p
\f3 rince
\f1 , and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. \
Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by t
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 o knights in the snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \'93Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.\'94 The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \'93You have not changed at all.\'94 \
Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm\'92s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden\'92s fan
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 asy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He\'92d had a giant\'92s strength too, his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume. \
Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy\'92s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy\'92s fal
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 en stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord\'92s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hos
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 age and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. \
Yet Robert was Ned\'92s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \'93Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\'94 \
By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. Robert\'92s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen\'92s ring, while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced, and approved of by both sides. \
No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \'93Take me down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\'94 \
Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He cal
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ed for a lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more. \
They went down to 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \'93
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,\'94 Robert 
\f3 complai
\f1 ned as they descended. \'93In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forge
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 s that your part is as big as the other six combined.\'94 \
\'93I trust you enjoyed the journey
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Your Grace?\'94\
Robert snorted. \'93Bogs and forests and fields, a
\f3 nd s
\f1 carcely a decent inn north of the \
Neck. I\'92ve never seen such a vast emptiness
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Where are all your people?\'94\
\'93Likely they were too shy to come out,\'94 Ned jested. He could feel the chill c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ming up the \
stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. \'93Kings are a rare sight in the north.\'94 \
Robert
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 snorted. \'93More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\'94 The king put one 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 and on the wall to steady himself as they descended. \
\'93Late summer snows are common enough,\'94 Ned said. \'93I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually mild.\'94 \
\'93The Others take your mild snows,\'94 Robert swore. \'93What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to think.\'94 \
\'93The winters are hard,\'94 Ned admitted. \'93But the Starks will endure. We always have.\'94 \
\'93You need to come south,\'94 Robert told him. \'93You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth\'97melons, peaches, fireplums, you\'92ve never tasted such sweetness. You\'92ll see, I brought you some. Even 
\f3 at St
\f1 orm\'92s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.\'94 He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \'93And the girls, Ned!\'94 he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \'93I swear, women lose a
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it\'92s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it\'92s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\'94 The king laughed happily. \
Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a man who knew how to take his pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shado
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 s moved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. \'93She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\'94 \
He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ad as they walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. \
By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y had sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselve
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  the Kings in the North. \
Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \'93Here,\'94 he told his king.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. \
There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned\'92s father, had a long, stern face. The stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the swor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  across his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. \
Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by ord
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule. \
Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of 
\f3 surp
\f1 assing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his heart. Robert had loved her even more.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 She was to have been his bride. \
\'93She was more beautiful than that,\'94 th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna\'92s face, as if he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 awkward by his weight. \'93Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?\'94 His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \'93She deserved mor
\f3 e than dar
\f1 kness . . . \'94 \
\'93She was a Stark of Winterfell,\'94 Ned said qu
\f3 ietly. \'93This is
\f1  her place.\'94 \
\'93She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.\'94 \
\'93I was with her when she died,\'94 Ned reminded the king. \'93She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.\'94 He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\'92s eyes. Ned remembered the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, de
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, H
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wland Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could recall none of it. \'93I bring her flowers when I can,\'94 he said. \'93Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\'94 \
The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it \
were living flesh. \'93I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\'94 \'93You did,\'94 Ned reminded him.\
\'93Only once,\'94 Robert said bitterly. \
They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, 
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ntil at last a crushing blow from Robert\'92s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. When Ned had finally come on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. \
\'93In my dreams, I kill him every night,\'94 Robert admitted. \'93A thousand deaths will still be les
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  than he deserves.\'94 \
There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \'93We should return
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Your Grace. Your wife will be waiting.\'94 \
\'93The Others take my wife,\'94 Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. \'93And if I hear \'91Your Grace\'92 once more, I\'92ll have your head on a spike. We are more to each other than that.\'94 \
\'93I had not forgotten,\'94 Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \'93Tell 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e about Jon.\'94 \
Robert shook his head. \'93I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y on my son\'92s name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\'94 He paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \'93I loved that old man.\'94 \
\'93We both did.\'94 Ned paused a moment. \'93Catelyn fea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\'94 \
Robert\'92s mouth gave a bitter twist. \'93Not well, in truth,\'94 he admitted. \'93I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Ro
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?\'94 \
Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \'93The wife has lost the husband,\'94 he said carefully. \'93Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\'94 \
\'93Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\'94 the king swore. \'93Lord Tyw
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n had never taken a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She refused to even hear of it. Then she left i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei was furious.\'94 He sighed deeply. \'93The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am sworn to p
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 otect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\'94 \
\'93I will take him as ward, if
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you wish,\'94 Ned said. \'93Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\'94 \
\'93A generous offer, my friend,\'94 the king said, \'93but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\'94 \
\'93I have more concern for my nephew\'92s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\'94 Ned declared. \
\'93That is because you do not sle
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p with a Lannister.\'94 Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. \'93Ah, Ned,\'94 he said, \'93you are still t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 o serious.\'94 He put a massive arm around Ned\'92s shoulders. \'93I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there\'92s no need for it. Come, walk with me.\'94 \
They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. The king kept his arm a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ound Ned\'92s shoulder. \'93You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.\'94 \
Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \'93For the joy of my company, surely,\'94 he said lightly. \'93And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night\'92s Watch is a shadow of what it 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nce was. Benjen says\'97\'94 \
\'93No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\'94 Robert said. \'93The Wall has stood fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Ey
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\'94 \
\'93His son . . . \'94 Ned began.\
\'93His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ncomes,\'94 Robert said brusquely. \'93No more.\'94 \
That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came unbi
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 den. \'93The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\'94 \
\'93Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\'94 Robert said. \'93I have this year to think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\'94 \
\'93In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father\'92s sake if not his own. Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.\'94 \
The king was not pleased. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e took his arm from around Ned\'92s shoulders. \'93Jon\'92s service was the duty he owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men o
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ght to know that. But the son is not the father. A mere boy cannot hold the e
\f3 ast.
\f1 \'94 Then his tone softened. \'93Enough of this. There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\'94 Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \'93I have need of you, Ned.\'94 \
\'93I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\'94 They were words he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next. \
Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. \'93Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King\'92s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.\'94 Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a Stark. \'93I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em complain until my mind is numb
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or land or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by fl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 tterers and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don\'92t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can\'92t find it. There are nights I wish we had los
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but . . . \
\'93I understand,\'94 Ned said softly. \
Robert looked at him. \'93I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\'94 He smiled. \'93Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\'94 \
Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 could Robert have had for coming so far? The H
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd of the King was the second-most powerful \
man in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Seven Kingdoms. He spoke with the king\'92s voice, commanded the king\'92s armies, drafted the king\'92s laws. At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense king\'92s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm it
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 elf. \
It was the last thing in the world he wanted. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 he s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. \'93I am not worthy of the honor.\'94 \
Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. \'93If I wanted to honor you, I\'92d let you retire. I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.\'94 He slapped his gut and grinned. \'93You know the saying, about t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e king and his Hand?\'94 \
Ned knew the saying. \'93What the king dreams,\'94 he said, \'93the Hand builds.\'94 \
\'93I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 put it. The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.\'94 He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winter
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes. \
Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \'93Damn it, Ned,\'94 the king complained. \'93You might at least humor me with a smile.\'94 \
\'93They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man\'92s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,\'94 Ned said evenly. \'93Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little hu
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 or.\'94 \
\'93Com
\f3 e so
\f1 uth with me, and I\'92ll teach you how to laugh again,\'94 the king promised. \'93You helped me win this damnable throne, now help
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me hold it. We were meant to rule together. If Lyanna had lived, we 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hould have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, it is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  might once have done.\'94 \
This offer did surprise him. \'93Sansa is only eleven.\'94\
Robert waved an impatient hand. \'93Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a \
few years.\'94 The king smiled. \'93Now stand up and say yes
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  curse you.\'94 \
\'93Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\'94 Ned a
\f3 nswer
\f1 ed. He hesitated. \'93These honors are all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . . \'94 \
\'93Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\'94 The king reached down, clasped Ned by th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1 \cf3  hand, an\cf2 d \cf3 pulled him roughly\cf2  t\cf3 o his
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 feet. \'93Ju\cf2 st\cf3  don\'92t keep me wai\cf2 ti\cf3 ng to
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38  lon
\f2\b0\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 . I am not the most patient of men.\'94 \
For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the north. He looked at the stone figures 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He could feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. \

JON \
There were times\'97not many, but a few\'97when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them. \
He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips. \
The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon\'92s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon\'92s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for. \
And he was finding that he had a man\'92s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king\'92s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all. \
His lord father had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. \
Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great \
disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. \
After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn\'92t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool. \
His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the cr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wn prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon\'92s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister\'92s hair and his mother\'92s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey\'92s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell\'92s Great Hall. \
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen\'92s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and the Imp; there was no mistaking which
\f3  was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was 
\f1 twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered \'93Kingslayer\'94 behind his back. \
Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed. \
Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother\'92s side. Tyrion Lannister, the youngest o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  Lord Tywin\'92s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother\'92s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his body, with a brute\'92s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and one black one peered ou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed whit
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 . Jon watched him with fascination. \
The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night\'92s Watch, and \
his father\'92s ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began. \
Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. \
Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \'93Hungry again?\'94 he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the cente
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor betwe
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n his legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too. \
His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken. \
Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three ti
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 es the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ride. Ghost went back to his meal. \
Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. \
\'93Is this one of the direwolves I\'92ve heard so much of?\'94 a familiar voice asked close at hand. \
Jon lo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ked up happi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf\'92s. \'93Yes,\'94 he said. \'93His name is Ghost.\'94 \
One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he\'92d been telling to make room at the table for 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 heir lord\'92s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon\'92s hand. \'93Summerwine,\'94 he said after a taste. \'93Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\'94 \
Jon smiled. \
Ben Stark laughed. \'93As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.\'94 He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and bit into it. It crunched. \
His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in black, as befitted a man of the Night\'92s Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver cha
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n was looped round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \'93A very quiet wolf,\'94 he observed. \
\'93He\'92s not like the others,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Jon said. \'93He never makes a sound. That\'92s why I named him Ghost. That, and because he\'92s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\'94 \
\'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\'94 Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look. \'93Don\'92t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\'94 \
\'93Most times,\'94 Jon answered in a flat voice. \'93But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.\'94 \
\'93I see.\'94 His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \'93My brother does not seem very festive tonight.\'94 \
Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded e
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 es, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 reat black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as co
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d as an ice sculpture. \'93
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he queen is angry too,\'94 Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \'93Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn\'92t wa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t him to go.\'94 \
Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \'93You don\'92t miss much, do 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.\'94 \
Jon swelled with pride. \'93Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I\'92m the better sword, and Hullen sa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 s I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\'94 \
\'93Notable achievements.\'94 \
\'93Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\'94 Jon said in a sudden rush. \'93Father will give me
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.\'94 \
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \'93The Wall is a hard plac
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  for a boy, Jon.\'94 \
\'93I am almost a man grown,\'94 Jon protested. \'93I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s true enough,\'94 Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon\'92s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\'94 Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes. \
\'93A conquest that lasted a summer,\'94 his uncle pointed out.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn\'92t a game.\'94 He took another sip of wine. \'93Also,\'94 he said, wiping his mouth, \'93Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?\'94 \
\'93I forget nothing,\'94 Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. \'93I want t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  serve in the Night\'92s Watch, Uncle.\'94 \
He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would com
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 and great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of cas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 les of their own. But what place could a ba
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tard hope to earn? \
\'93You don\'92t know what you\'92re asking, Jon. The Night\'92s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no families. None of us will eve
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is hono
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 .\'94 \
\'93A bastard can have honor too,\'94 Jon said. \'93I am ready to swear your oath.\'94 \
\'93You are a boy of fourteen,\'94 Benjen said. \'93Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a wom
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t c
\f3 are ab
\f1 out that!\'94 Jon said hotly. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 You might, if you knew what it meant,\'94 Benjen said. \'93If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.\'94 \
Jon felt anger rise insi
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e him. \'93I\'92m not your son!\'94 \
Benjen Stark stood up. \'93More\'92s the pity.\'94 He put a hand on Jon\'92s shoulder. \'93Come back to me after you\'92ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\'92ll see how you feel.\'94 \
Jon trembled. \'93I will never father a bastard,\'94 he said carefully. \'93Never!\'94 He spat it out like venom. \
Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. \
\'93I must be excused,\'94 he said with the last of his dignity. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e whirled and bolted before they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night. \
The yard was quiet a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 eserted. Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 minded him of that tonight. \
The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. \
\'93Boy,\'94 a voice called out to him. Jon turned. \
Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  him. \'93Is that animal a wolf?\'94 \
\'93A direwolf,\'94 Jon said. \'93His name is Ghost.\'94 He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. \'93What are you doing up there? Why aren\'92t you at the feast?\'94 \
\'93Too hot, too noisy, and 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 \'92d drunk too much wine,\'94 the dwarf told 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im. \'93I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a clo
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 er look at your wolf?\'94 \
Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \'93Can you climb down, or shall I br
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng a ladder?\'94 \
\'93Oh, bleed that,\'94 the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted ba
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 kward onto his legs. \
Ghost backed away from him uncertainly. \
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \'93I believe I\'92ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.\'94 \
\'93He
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s not scared,\'94 Jon said. He knelt and called out. \'93Ghost, come here. Come on. That\'92s it.\'94 \
The wol
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon\'92s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 warf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \'93Shy, isn\'92t he?\'94 Lannister observed. \
\'93Sit, Ghost,\'94 Jon commanded. \'93That\'92s it. Keep sti
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l.\'94 He looked up at the dwarf. \'93You can touch him now. He won\'92t move until I tell him to. I\'92ve 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 een training him.\'94 \
\'93I see,\'94 Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost\'92s ears and said, \'93Nice wolf.\'94 \
\'93If I wasn\'92
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  here, he\'92d tear out your throat,\'94 Jon said. It wasn\'92t actually true yet, but it would be. \
\'93In that case, you had best stay close,\'94 the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his 
\f3 mism
\f1 atched eyes. \'93I am Tyr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 on Lannister.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 Jon said. He rose. Standing, 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange. \
\'93You\'92re Ned Stark\'92s bastard, aren\'92t you?\'94\
Jon felt a col
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing. \
\'93Did I offend you?\'94 Lannis
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er said. \'93Sorry. Dwarfs don\'92t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\'94 He grinned. \'93You are the bastard, though.\'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard Sta
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k is my father,\'94 Jon admitted stiffly. \
Lannister studied his face. \'93Yes,\'94 he said
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93I can see it. You have more of the north in you 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 han your brothers.\'94 \
\'93Half brothers,\'94 Jon correcte
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . He was pleased by the dwarf\'92s comment, but he tried not to let it show. \
\'93Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\'94 
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 annister said. \'93Never forget what you are, for su
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.\'94 \
Jon was in no mood for anyone\'92s counsel. \'93What do you know about being a bastard?\'94 \
\'93All dwarfs are bastards in their father\'92s eyes.\'94 \
\'93You are your mother\'92s trueborn son of Lannister.\'94 \
\'93Am I?\'94 the dwarf replied, sardonic. \'93Do tell my lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1 \cf3  father. \cf2 My\cf3  mother died birth\cf2 in\cf3 g me,
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 and he\'92s \cf2 ne\cf3 ver been sure.\'94 \
\cf2 \'93I\cf3  don\'92
\f2 \cf2 t
\f0\b\fs38  even kn
\f2\b0\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w who my mother was,\'94 Jon said. \
\'93Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\'94 He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \'93Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\'94 And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. \

CATELYN \
Of all the rooms in Winterf
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll\'92s Great Keep, Catelyn\'92s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man\'92s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from fre
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 zing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death. \
Catelyn\'92s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place. \
So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hamber. \
The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e furs to her chin and watched him. He looke
\f3 d som
\f1 ehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at R
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 verrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  She could give him another son. \
\'93I will refuse him,\'94 Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt. \
Catelyn sat up in the bed. \'93You cannot. You must not.\'94\
\'93My duties are here in the north. I have no w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 sh to be Robert\'92s Hand.\'94 \
\'93He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can\'92t you see the danger that would put us in?\'94 \
Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. \'93Robert would never h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rm me or any of mine. We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m
\f3 , he
\f1  will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the man!\'94 \
\'93You knew the man,\'94 she said. \'93The king is a stranger to you.\'94 Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 She had to make him see. \'93Prid
\f3 e is e
\f1 verything to a king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Honors?\'94 Ned laughed bitterly. \'93In his eyes, yes,\'94 she s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. \'93And in yours?\'94 \
\'93And in mine,\'94 she blazed, angry now. Why couldn\'92t he see? \'93He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 o wrong with that?\'94 \
\'93Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\'94 Ned said. \'93And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . . \'94\
She finish
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d for him. \'93 . . . crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only \
twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.\'94 \
That brought a bitte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  twist to Ned\'92s mouth. \'93Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King\'92s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\'94 \
\'93Perhaps not,\'94 Catelyn said, 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t.\'94 \
Ned turned away from her, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ack to the night. He stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or p
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rhaps the sentries on the wall. \
Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Br
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ndon\'92s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son. \
She was abou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  to go to him when the knock came at the door, lo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 d and unexpected. Ned \
turned, frowning. \'93What is it?\'94 \
Desmond\'92s voice came through the door. \'93My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience.\'94 \
\'93You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\'94 \'93Yes, my lord. He insists.\'94\
\'93Very well. Send him in.\'94 \
Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \'93Perhaps we should close the windows,\'94 she suggested. \
Ned nodded absently. Ma
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ster Luwin was shown in. \
The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, what little the years had left him. Hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  robe was grey wool, trimmed
\f3  wit
\f1 h white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy slee
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 es had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that Maester Luwin could lift his arms 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t all. \
The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \'93My lord,\'94 he said to Ned, \'93pardon for 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 isturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\'94 \
Ned looked irritated. \'93Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 not told.\'94 \
\'93There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observato
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 party. We have had no other visitors from the south.\'94 \
\'93A wooden box, you say?\'94 Catelyn said. \
\'93Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from My
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.\'94 \
Ned frowned. He had little patience for this s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rt of thing, Catelyn knew. \'93A lens,\'94 he said. \'93What has that to do with me?\'94 \
\'93I asked the same question,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \'93Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\'94 \
Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shi
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ered. \'93A lens is an instrument to help us see.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Indeed it is.\'94 He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \'93What is it that they would have us see more clearly?\'94 \
\'93The very thing I asked myself.\'94 Maester Luwin drew a tight
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y rolled paper out of his sleeve. \'93I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.\'94 \
Ned held out his hand. \'93Let me have it, then.\'94 \
Luwin did not stir. \'93Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\'94 \
Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beside the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin b
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wed and began to retreat. \
\'93Stay,\'94 Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \'93What is it? My lady, you\'92re shaking.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m afraid,\'94 she admitted. She reached 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut and took the let
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er in trembling hands. The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wa
\f2\fs24 x
\f1\fs28  was the moon-and- falcon seal of House Arryn. \'93It\'92s from Lysa.\'94 Catelyn looked at her husband. \'93It will not make us glad,\'94 she told him. \'93There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it.\'94 \
Ned frowned, his face darkening. \'93Open it.\'94 Catelyn broke the seal. \
Her eyes mov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \'93Lysa took no chances. When we were girls t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 gether, we had a private lan
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 uage, she and I.\'94 \
\'93Can you read it?\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Catelyn admitted.\
\'93Then tell us.\'94\
\'93Perhaps I should withdraw,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \
\'93No,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93We will need your counsel
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room. \
Maester Luwin aver
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \'93What are you doing?\'94 he asked. \
\'93Lighting a fire,\'94 Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold hearth. \
\'93Maester Luwin\'97\'94 Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  began. \
\'93Maester Luwin has delivered all my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 children,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93This is no time for false modesty.\'94 She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it. \
Ned crossed the room, took her by the ar
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches from her. \'93My lady, tell me! What was this message?\'94 \
Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. \'93A warning,\'94 she said 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 oftly. \'93If we have the wits to hear.\'94 His eyes searched her face. \'93Go on.\'94\
\'93Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\'94\
His fingers ti
\f3 ghten
\f1 ed on her arm. \'93By whom?\'94 \
\'93The Lannisters,\'94 she told him. \'93The qu
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 en.\'94 \
Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \'93Gods,\'94 he whispered. His voice was hoarse. \'93Your sister is sick with grief. Sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  cannot know what she is saying.\'94 \
\'93She knows,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. \
To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.\'94 Catelyn look
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d to her husband. \'93Now we truly have no choice. You must be Robert\'92s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\'94 \
She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \'93The only truths I know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\'94 \
Luwi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \'93The Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn\'92s death, to bring his killers to the king\'92s justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\'94 \
Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn\'92s heart went out to him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her c
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ildren\'92s sake. \'93You say you love Robert like a brother. Woul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\'94 \
\'93The Others take both of you,\'94 Ned muttered darkly. He turne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  away from them and went to the window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. When he turned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes. \'93My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He never came home again.\'94 \
\'93A different time,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \'93A different king.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.\'94 \
His words
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 were like an icy draft through her heart. \'93No,\'94 she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93Yes,\'94 Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \'93You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert\'92s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterf
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your councils. He must be ready when his time comes.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Gods will, not for many years,\'94 Maester Luwi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  murmured. \
\'93Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\'94 \
Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 atelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. \'93What of the other children?\'94 \
Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \'93Rickon is very young,\'94 he said gently. \'93He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93I could not bear it,\'94 Catelyn said, trembling. \
\'93You must,\'94 he said. \'93Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.\'94 \
Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that A
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \'93Yes,\'94 she said, \'93but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\'94 \
\'93I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\'94 Ned said. \'93Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\'94 \
He was right; Catelyn knew i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. Winterfell was such a vast place. \'93Keep him off the walls, then,\'94 she said bravely. \'93You know how Bran loves to climb.\'94 \
Ned kissed the te
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rs from her eyes before they could fall. \'93Thank you, my lady,\'94 he whispered. \'93This is hard, I know.\'94 \
\'93What of Jon Snow, my lord?\'94 Maester Luwin asked.\
Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away. \
Many men fathe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man\'92s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father\'92s \
castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child\'92s needs. \
He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him \'93son\'94 for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence. \
That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  her husband\'92s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys\'92s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur\'92s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lad
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face. \
That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \'93Never ask me about Jon,\'94 he said, cold as ice. \'93He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.\'94 She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashar
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  Dayne\'92s name was never heard in Winterfell again. \
Who
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ver Jon\'92s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with al
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned\'92s sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he look
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \'93Jon must go,\'94 she said now. \
\'93He and Robb are close,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Ned said. \'93I had hoped . . . \'94 \
\'93He cannot stay here,\'94 Catelyn said, cutting him off. \'93He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\'94 It was hard, she knew, but n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell. \
The look Ned gave her was anguished. \'93You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard\'92s name . . . you know what 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hey will say of him. He will be shunned.\'94 \
Catelyn armore
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\'92s eyes. \'93They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\'94 \
\'93And none of them has ever been seen at court!\'94 Ned blazed. \'93The Lannister woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He\'97\'94 \
His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \'93Another solution presents itself,\'94 he sai
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , his voice quiet. \'93Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 It seems the boy aspires to take the black.\'94 \
Ned looked shocked. \'93He asked to join the Night\'92s Watch?\'94 \
Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet gladly would
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would f
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ther no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn\'92s own grandchildren for Winterfell. \
Maester Luwin said, \'93There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\'94 \
\'93And even a bastard may rise high in the Night\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  Watch,\'94 Ned reflected. Still, his voice was 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 roubled. \'93Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen . . . \'94 \
\'93A hard sacrifice,\'94 Maester Luwin agreed. \'93Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler than yours or yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1 \cf3 r lady\'92s.\cf2 \'94 \cf3 \
Catelyn thought \cf2 of\cf3  the 
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3 hree chil\cf2 dr\cf3 en she must lose. \cf2 It\cf3  was 
\f2 \cf2 n
\f1\fs28 ot easy keeping silent then. \
Ned t
\f2\fs24 u
\f0\b\fs38 rned 
\f2\b0\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 way from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he sighed, and turned back. \'93Very well,\'94 he said to Maester Luwin. \'93I suppose it is for the best. I will speak to Ben.\'94 \
\'93When shall we tell Jon?\'94 the maester asked. \
\'93When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would sooner let Jon enjoy the
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.\'94 \

Arya\'92s stitches were crooked again. \
ARYA \
She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\'92s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \'93Sansa\'92s work is as pretty as she is,\'94 Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \'93She has such fine, delicate ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ds.\'94 When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \'93Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\'94 \
Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the womanly arts, as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Myrcella\'92s stitches lo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. \
She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , then sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 sa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\'92s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ver to whisper something in her ear. \
\'93What are you talking about?\'94 Arya asked suddenly. \
Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. \
\'93Tell me,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Arya said. \
Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. \
\'93We were talking about the prince,\'94 Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. \
Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally. \
\'93Joffrey likes your sister,\'94 Jeyne whispered, pr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ud as if she had something to do with it. Sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  was the daughter of Winterfell\'92s steward and Sansa\'92s dearest friend. \'93He told her she was ver
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  beautiful.\'94 \
\'93He\'92s going to marry her,\'94 little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \'93Then Sansa will be que
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n of all the realm.\'94 \
Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \'93Beth, you shouldn\'92t make up s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ories,\'94 Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \'93What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\'92s ve
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y gallant, don\'92t you think?\'94 \
\'93Jon says he looks like a girl,\'94 Arya said. \
Sansa sighed as she stitched. \'93Poor Jon,\'94 she said. \'93He gets jealous because he\'92s a bastard.\'94 \
\'93He\'92s our brother,\'94 Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ower room. \
Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was fro
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ning now. \'93What are you talking about, children?\'94 \
\'93Our half brother,\'94 Sansa corrected, soft and precise.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 She smiled for the septa. \'93Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\'94 she said. \
Septa Mordane nodded. \'93Indeed. A great honor for us all.\'94 Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment. \'93Arya, why aren\'92t you at work?\'94 the septa as
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \'93Let me see your stitches.\'94 \
Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e septa\'92s attention. \'93Here,\'94 she said, surrendering up her work. \
The septa examined the fabric. \'93Arya, Arya, Arya,\'94 she said. \'93This will not do. This will not do at all.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\'92s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorr
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door. \
Septa Mordane called after her. \'93Arya, come back here! Don\'92t you take another step! Your lady mother will hear of thi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . In front of our royal princess too! You\'92ll shame us all!\'94 \
Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \'93By your leave, my lady.\'94 \
Myrcella blinked at he
\f3 r an
\f1 d looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane was not. \'93Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\'94 the septa demanded. \
Arya glared at her. \'93I have to go shoe a horse,\'94 she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa\'92s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her. \
It wasn\'92t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\'92s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing 
\f3 Arya
\f1  c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. \
Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then. \
Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed li
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e two golden coins.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  course, had named her pup \'93Lady.\'94 Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled. \
By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Pr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nce Joffrey flat on his back. \'93Come,\'94 she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 lf coming \
hard at her heels. \
There was a window in 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he covered bridge between the 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rmory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed. \
They arr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ved, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. \
Jon gave her a curious look. \'93Shouldn\'92t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\'94 \
Arya made a face at him. \'93I wanted to see them fight.\'94 \
He smiled. \'93Come here, then.\'94 \
Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below. \
To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ough he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, wh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb\'92s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry con
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 empt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. \
\'93A shade more exhausting than nee
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 lework,\'94 Jon observed. \
\'93A shade more fun than needlework,\'94 Arya gave back a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their fath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r\'92s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her. \
\'93Why aren\'92t you down in the yard?\'94 Arya a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ked him.\
He gave her a half smile. \'93Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\'94 he said. \
\'93Any bruises they take in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the practice yard must come from true
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 orn swords.\'94 \
\'93Oh.\'94 Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair. \
She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \'93I could do just as good as Bran,\'94 she said. \'93He\'92s only seven. I\'92m nine.\'94 \
Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-ol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  wisdom. \'93You\'92re too skinny,\'94 he said. He took her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \'93I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\'94 \
Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and Tommen circ
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e each other. \
\'93You see Prince Joffrey?\'94 Jon asked. \
She hadn\'92t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There wer
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. \
\'93Look at the arms on his surcoat,\'94 Jon suggested. \
Arya looked. An ornate shield had been em
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 roidered on the prince\'92s padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. \
\'93The Lannisters are proud,\'94 Jon observed. \'93You\'92d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\'92s House equal in honor to the king\'92s.\'94 \
\'93The woman is important too!\'94 Arya protested. \
Jon chuckled. \'93Perhap
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\'94 \
\'93A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\'94 It made her laugh. \'93That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\'92t fight, why should she have a coat 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f arms?\'94 \
Jon shrugged. \'93Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards ge
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\'94 \
There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n began to laugh. \
\'93Enough!\'94 Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a hand and yanked him back to his feet. \'93Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\'94 He looked around.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\'94 \
Robb, already sweaty from a previous b
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut, moved forward eagerly. \'93Gladly.\'94 \
Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik\'92s summons
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  His hair shone like spun gold. He looked bored. \'93This is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \'93You are children,\'94 he said derisively. \
\'93Robb may be a child,\'94 J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ffrey said. \'93I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.\'94 \
\'93You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\'94 Robb said. \'93Are you afraid?\'94 \
Prince Joffrey looked at him. \'93Oh, terrified,\'94 he said. \'93You\'92re so much ol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 er.\'94 Some of the Lannister men laughed. \
Jon looked down on the scene with a fro
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n. \'93Joffrey is truly a little shit,\'94 he told Arya. \
Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 white whiskers.
\f3  \'93What 
\f1 are you suggesting?\'94 he asked the prince. \
\'93Live steel.\'94\
\'93Done,\'94 Robb shot back. \'93You\'92ll be sorry
\f2\fs24 !
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb\'92s shoulder to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 quiet him. \'93Live steel 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s too dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\'94 \
J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, push
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d forward in front of the prince. \'93This is your prince. 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 ho are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?\'94 \
\'93Maste
\f3 r-at
\f1 -arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do we
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l not to forget it.\'94 \
\'93Are you training women here?\'94 the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull. \
\'93I am training knights,\'94 Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \'93They will hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  steel when they are ready. When they are of an age.\'94 \
The burned man looked at Robb. \'93How old are you, boy?\'94 \
\'93Fourteen,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93I killed 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\'94 \
Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \'93Let me do it. I can beat him.\'94 \
\'93Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\'94 Ser Rodrik said. \
J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ffrey shrugged. \'93Come and see me when you\'92re older, Stark. If you\'92re not too old.\'94 There was laughter from the Lannister men. \
Robb\'92s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb\'92s arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay. \
Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \'93Come, Tommen,\'94 he said. \'93The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.\'94 \
That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik\'92s face was beet-r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 princes and their party were safely away. \
Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \'93The show is d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne,\'94 he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \'93You had best run back to your roo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , little siste
\f3 r. S
\f1 epta Mordane
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 will sure\cf2 ly\cf3  be lurking. The l\cf2 on\cf3 ger y

\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\'94 \
Arya didn\'92t think it was funny. \'93I hate needlework!\'94 she said with passion. \'93It\'92s not fair!\'94 \
\'93Nothing is fair,\'94 Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya was not coming. \
Reluctantly she turned in the other direction.\
It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn\'92t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was \
Septa Mordane and her mother. \

BRAN \
The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 llowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen\'92s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south. \
Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to the 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 all, to join the Night\'92s Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. \
For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King\'92s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the ki
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g with all his knights and sworn swords. \
Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\'92s swords hu
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 dreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold. \
Two of the Kingsguard had come north with Kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn\'92t count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the \
Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King\'92s Landing, and Bran had 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 een marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine. \
Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \'93Hodor,\'94 the man in the glass gardens who gave him a bla
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 kberry when he came to visit . . . \
But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn\'92t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his father\'92s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he sho
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ed very little interest in chasing sticks. \
He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon\'92s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Br
\f3 an w
\f1 ish
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn\'92t white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right. \
Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn\'92t been up to the b
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 oken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance. \
He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \'93You st
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y here,\'94 he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. \'93Lie down. That\'92s right. Now stay\'97\'94 \
The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl. \
Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. \'93Quiet,\'94 he yelled. \'93Sit down. Stay. You\'92re worse than Mother.\'94 The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 out of sight. \
The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran\'92s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true. \
To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn\'92t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ted, its roots sunk deep into the earth. \
When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tendi
\f3 ng their vegetab
\f1 les in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the
\f3  god
\f1 swood, the girls gossi
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ing beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know. \
It taught him Winterfell\'92s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the ro
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 kery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tun
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 el in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn\'92t know that, Bran was convinced. \
His moth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he wouldn\'92t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that p
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 omise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep. \
He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone \
all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove. \
As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \'93You\'92re not my son,\'94 he told B
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 an when they fetched him down, \'93you\'92re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.\'94 \
Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad litt
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows\'92 nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes. \
Later, Maes
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran\'92s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \'93I\'92m not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.\'94 \
Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ever saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible. \
He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He lik
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all. \
Most of all, he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran\'92s secret place. \
His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had 
\f3 been 
\f1 a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and \
the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows. \
He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them. \
The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn\'92t hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller tha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyle
\f3 s le
\f1 aned out blindly over
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eally stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n the crows would come round to see if you\'92d brought any corn. \
Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ase of long practice when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First K
\f3 eep had
\f1  been empty all his life. \
\'93I do not li
\f3 ke it,\'94 a
\f1  woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. \'93You should be the Hand.\'94 \
\'93Gods forbid,\'94 a man\'92s voice replied lazily. \'93It\'92s not an honor I\'92d want. There\'92s far too much work involved.\'94 \
Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by. \
\'93Don\'92t you see the danger this puts us in?\'94 the woman said. \'93Robert loves the man like a brot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er.\'94 \
\'93Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t p
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ay the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refu
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e him.\'94 \
\'93We ought to count ourselves fortunate,\'94 the man said. \'93The king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies ra
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her than ambitious ones, and I\'92ll sleep more easily by night.\'94 \
They were talking about Father, Bran
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet . . . but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window. \
\'93We will have to watch him careful
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y,\'94 the woman said.\
\'93I would sooner watch you,\'94 the man said. He sounded bored. \'93Come back here.\'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Nec
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 the woman said. \'93Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?\'94 \
\'93A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of hist
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ry, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.\'94 \
\'93His wife is Lady Arryn\'92s sister. It\'92s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\'94 \
Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to lo
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 er himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach. \
\'93You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rightened cow.\'94\
\'93That frightened cow sha
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed Jon Arryn\'92s bed.\'94\
\'93If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King\'92s Landing.\'94 \
\'93When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She knew the boy\'92s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bo
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 der now that he\'92s safe atop the Eyrie.\'94 \
\'93Mothers.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 The man made the word sound like a curse. \'93I think birthing does something to your minds. You are all mad.\'94 He l
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ughed. It was a bitter sound. \'93Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\'94 He paused a moment. \'93Or does she?\'94 \
\'93Do you think 
\f3 the k
\f1 ing will require proof?\'94 the woman said. \'93I tell you, he loves me not.\'94 \
\'93And whose fault is that, sweet sister?\'94 \
Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up . . . except that mig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears. \
\'93You are as blind as Robert,\'94 the woman was saying. \
\'93If you mean I see the same thing, yes,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  the man said. \'93I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.\'94 \
\'93He betrayed one alre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 dy, or have you forgotten?\'94 the woman said. \'93Oh, I don\'92t deny he\'92s loyal to Robert, that\'92s obvious. 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 hat happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we\'92ll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside him will only make him worse. H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 \'92s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. How long till 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?\'94 \
Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who was talking. \
The man sighed. \'93Yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  should think less about th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  future and more about the pleasures at hand.\'94 \
\'93Stop that!\'94 the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\'92s laughter. \
Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 onto the roof. This was the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking. \
\'93All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\'94 the man said. \'93Come here and be quiet.\'94 \
Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung him
\f3 self ar
\f1 ound, upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 still wet with melted snow. \
Bran looked in the window. \
Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who they were. The man\'92s back 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall. \
There were
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \'93Stop it,\'94 she said, \'93stop it, stop it. Oh, please . . . \'94 But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast. \
Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung from side to s
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 de as her head moved back and forth, but
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 still he recognized the queen. \
He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring rig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t at
\f3  him
\f1 . She screamed. \
Everything happened at once then. \'91 Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as failing. There was an instant of vertigo, a sicken
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it again with his other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangle
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , one-handed, panting. \
Faces appeared in the window above him. \
The queen. And now Bran recognized the m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror. \
\'93He saw us,\'94 the woman said shrilly. \'93So he did,\'94 the man sai
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . \
Bran\'92s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into un
\f2\fs24 y
\f1 \cf3 ielding s\cf2 to\cf3 ne. The man reache\cf2 d \cf3 down.
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 \'93Take my \cf2 ha\cf3 nd,\'94 he said. \'93Bef\cf2 or\cf3 e you
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 fall.\'94 
\f1\b0\fs28 \
Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to \
the ledge. \'93What are you doing?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  the woman demanded. \
The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. \'93How old are you, boy?\'94 \
\'93Seven,\'94 Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\'92s forearm. He let go sheepishly. \
The man 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ooked over at the woman. \'93The things I do for love,\'94 he said with loathing. He gave Bran a shove. \
Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him. \
Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn. \

TYRION \
Somewhere in the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 reat stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning. \
Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack. \
When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long- dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his h
\f3 and. His readin
\f1 g lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for sleeping. \
His legs were stiff a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. \'93Chayle,\'94 he said softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. \'93I\'92m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Val
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon\'92s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy I\'92ve ever seen.\'94 Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated his instruction
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks. \
Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane\'92s rasping voice drifted up to him. \'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.\'94 \
Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarme
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  around them. \'93At least he dies quietly,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the prince replied. \'93It\'92s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night.\'94 \
Clegane cast a long s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 adow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head. \'93I could silence the creature, if i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  please you,\'94 he said through his open visor. His boy placed a longsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behin
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  him, the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel. \
The notion seemed to delight the prince. \'93Send a dog to kill a dog!\'94 he exclaimed. \'93Winterfell is so infested wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h wolves, the Starks would never miss one.\'94 \
Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. \'93I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beg to differ, nephew,\'94 he said. \'93The Starks can count past six. Unlike some princes I might name.\'94 \
Joffrey had the grace at least to blush. \
\'93A voice from nowhere
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and that. \'93Spirits of the air!\'94 \
The prince l
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer\'92s farce. Tyrion was used to it. \'93Down here.\'94 \
The tall man peered down at the grou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d, and pretended to notice him. \'93The little lord Tyrion,\'94 he said. \'93My pardons. I did not see you standing there.\'94 \
\'93I am in no mood for your insolence today.\'94 Tyrion turned to his nephew. \'93Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.\'94 \
Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. \'93What good wil
\f3 l my c
\f1 omf
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rt do them?\'94 \
\'93None,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted.\'94\
\'93The Stark boy is nothing to me,\'94 Joffrey said. \'93I cannot abide the wailin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  of women.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy\'92s cheek began to redden. \
\'93One word,\'94 Tyrion said, \'93and I will hit you again.\'94 \'93I\'92m going to tell Mother!\'94 Joffrey exclaimed. Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed. \
\'93You tell your mother,\'94 Tyrion told him. \'93But first you get yourself to Lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with them. Do you understand? Do 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou?\'94 \
The boy looked as though 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run. \
A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming ove
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 head like a cliff. His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over Cle
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ane\'92s hideously burned face. \
\'93The prince will remember that, little lord,\'94 the Hound warned him. The helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble. \
\'93I pray he does,\'94 Tyrion Lannister replied. \'93If he forgets, be a good dog a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d remind him.\'94 He glanced around the courtyard. \'93Do you know where I might find my brother?\'94 \
\'93Breaking fast with the queen.\'94 \
\'93Ah,\'94 Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound today. The man did have a temper. \
A cold, cheerl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ss meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime sat at table with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Cersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices. \
\'93Is Robert still abed?\'94 Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table. \
His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born. \'93The king has not slept at all,\'94 she told him. \'93He is with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.\'94 \
\'93He has a large hear
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , our Robert,\'94 Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or res
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything. \
A servant approached. \'93Bread,\'94 Tyrion told him, \'93and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 wo of those little fish, and a mug \
of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black.\'94 The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ack to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part this morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eye
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . Their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats. \
Tyrion wond
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red what it would be like to have a twin, and decide
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  that he would rather not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to contempl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 te. \
Prince Tommen spoke up. \'93Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?\'94 \
\'93I stopped by the sickroom last night,\'94 Tyrion announced. \'93There was no change. The maester thought that a hopeful sign.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want Brandon to die,\'94 Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n a pod themselves. \
\'93Lord Eddard had a broth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r named Brandon as well,\'94 Jaime mused. \'93One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.\'94 \
\'93Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,\'94 Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ripped off a chunk of black bread. \
Cersei was studying him warily. \'93What do you mean?\'94 \
Tyrion gave her a crook
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d smile. \'93Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy may yet live.\'94 He took a sip of beer. \
Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 tween Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a secon
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. \'93That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.\'94 \
\'93What were the maester\'92s words?\'94 Jaime asked. \
The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, \'93He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h no change.\'94 \
\'93Will Bran get better, Uncle?\'94 little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother\'92s beauty, and n
\f3 one 
\f1 of her nature. \
\'93His back is broken, li
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 tle one,\'94 Tyrion told her. \'93The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive with honey a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.\'94 \
\'93If he wakes,\'94 C
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rsei repeated. \'93Is that likely?\'94 \
\'93The gods alone kn
\f3 ow,\'94
\f1  Tyrion told her. \'93The maester only hopes.\'94 He chewed some more bread. \'93I would swear t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.\'94 \
The queen shuddered. \'93There is something unnatural abou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  those animals,\'94 she said. \'93They are dangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.\'94 \
Jaime said, \'93You\'92ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 irls everywhere.\'94 \
Tyrion started on his fish. \'93Are you leaving soon, then?\'94\
\'93Not near soon enough,\'94 Cersei said. Then she frowned. \'93Are we leaving?\'94 she echoed. \
\'93What 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 bout you? Gods, don\'92t tell me you are staying here?\'94\
Tyri
\f3 on sh
\f1 rugged. \'93Benjen Stark is returning to the Night\'92s Watch with his brother\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.\'94 J
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ime smiled. \'93I hope you\'92re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.\'94 \
Tyrion laughed. \'93What, me, celiba
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 f the edge of the world.\'94 \
Cersei stood abruptly. \'93The children don\'92t need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella, come.\'94 She strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing be
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ind her. \
Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfull
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  with those cool green eyes. \'93Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of dea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h.\'94 \
\'93He will if Robert commands it,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.\'94 \
\'93He could end his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 torment,\'94 Jaime said. \'93I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.\'94 \
\'93I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93He would not take it kindly.\'94 \
\'93Even if the boy does live, he will 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1 \cf3 e a cripp\cf2 le\cf3 . Worse than a cri\cf2 pp\cf3 le. A
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 grotesque\cf2 . \cf3 Give me a good cle\cf2 an\cf3  deat
\f2 \cf2 h
\f0\b\fs38 .\'94 
\f2\b0\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. \'93Speaking for the grotesques,\'94 he said, \'93I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.\'94 \
Jaime smiled. \'93You are a perverse little imp, aren\'92t you?\'94 \
\'93Oh, yes,\'94 Tyrion admitted. \'93I hope the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say.\'94 \
His brother\'92s smile curdled like sour milk. \'93Tyrion, my sweet brother,\'94 h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  said darkly, \'93there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.\'94 \
Tyrion\'92s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, \'93Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,\'94 he said, \'93you wound me. You know how much I love my family.\'94 \

JON \
Jon climbed the steps 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 lowly, trying not to think that 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 his might be the last time ever. Ghost padded silently beside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jon\'92s liking. \
He reached
\f3  the
\f1  landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hand. He took courage from that. He straightened, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d entered the room. \
Lady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. Not for a moment had she le
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 t Bran\'92s side. She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarce
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y slept at all. She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had stayed away. \
But now there was no more time. \
He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come close
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . The window was open. Below, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head. \
Lady Stark looked ov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she blinked. \'93What are you doing here?\'94 she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless. \
\'93I c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 me to see Bran,\'94 Jon said. \'93To say good-bye.\'94 \
Her face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as though she had aged twenty years. \'93You\'92ve said it. Now go away.\'94 \
Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again. He took a nervous step into the room. \'93Please,\'94 he said. \
Something cold moved in her eyes. \'93I told you to leave,\'94 she said. \'93We don\'92t want
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you here.\'94 \
Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ly made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night\'92s Watch soon, and \
face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark. \'93He\'92s my brother,\'94 he said. \'93Shall I call the guards?\'94 \
\'93Call them,\'94 Jon said, defiant. \'93You can\'92t stop me from seein
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  him.\'94 He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay. \
She was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the B
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 an he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. The fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave. \
Yet under the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th each shallow breath. \
\'93Bran,\'94 he said, \'93I\'92m sorry I didn\'92t come before. I was afraid.\'94 He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks. Jon no lon
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 er cared. \'93Don\'92t die, Bran. Please. We\'92re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone . . . \'94 \
Lady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside the window
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  the direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name. \
\'93I have to go no
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 Jon said. \'93Uncle Benjen is waiting. I\'92m to go north to the Wall. We have to leave toda
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 , before the snows come.\'94 He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey. It was more than he could bear, the thought of l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 aving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips. \
\'93I wanted him to stay here with me,\'94 Lady Stark said softly. \
Jon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. She was tal
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room. \
\'93I prayed for it,\'94 she said dully. \'93He was my special boy. I went to the sept 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd prayed seven times to the seven fa
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 es of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers are answered.\'94 \
Jon did not know what to say. \'93It wasn\'92t your fault,\'94 he managed after an awkward silence. \
Her eyes found him. They were fu
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l of poison. \'93I need none of your absolution, bastard.\'94 \
Jon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran\'92s hands. He took the other, squeezed it. Fingers like the bones of birds. \'93Good-bye,\'94 he said. \

\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e was at the door when she called out to him. \'93Jon,\'94 she said. He should have kept g
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ing, but she had never called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were s
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 eing it for the first time. \
\'93Yes?\'94 he said. \
\'93It should have been you,\'94 she told him. Then she turned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cry before. \
It was a long walk down to the yard. \
Outside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being load
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd saddled and led from the stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off. \
Robb was in the middl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fall and his mother\'92s collapse had somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his side. \
\'93Uncl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Benjen is looking for you,\'94 he told Jon. \'93He wanted to be
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gone an hour ago.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 Jon said. \'93Soon.\'94 He looked around at all the noise and confusion. \'93Leaving is harder than I thought.\'94 \
\'93For me
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 too,\'94 Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rom the heat of his body. \'93Did you see him?\'94 \
Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak. \'93He\'92s not going to die,\'94 Robb said. \'93I know it.\'94 \
\'93You Starks are hard to kill,\'94 Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll the strength from him. \
Robb knew something was wrong. \'93My mother . . . \'94 \
\'93She was . . . very kind,\'94 Jon told him.\
Robb looked relieved. \'93Good.\'94 He smiled. \'93The next time I see you, you\'92ll be all in black.\'94 \
Jon forced himself to smile back. \'93It was always my color. How long do you think it will be?\'94 \
\'93Soon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 enough,\'94 Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely. \'93Farewell, Snow.\'94 \
Jon hugged him back. \'93And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.\'94 \
\'93I will.\'94 They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. \'93Uncle Benj
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n said to send you to the stables if I 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aw you,\'94 Robb finally said. \
\'93I have one more farewell to make,\'94 Jon told him. \
\'93Then I haven\'92t seen you,\'94 Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep. \
Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . Nymeria was helping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in her ja
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 s, and fetch it back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them. \
Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck. \'93I was afraid you were gone,\'94 she said, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r breath catching in her throat. \'93They wouldn\'92t let me out to say good-b
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 e.\'94 \
\'93What did you do now?\'94 Jon was amused. \
Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face. \'93Nothing. I was all packed and everything.\'94 She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the c
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 othes that were scattered all over the room. \'93Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 y things weren\'92t properly folded, she says. A proper southron lady doesn\'92t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.\'94 \
\'93Is that what you did, little sister?\'94\
\'93Well, they\'92re going to get all messed up anyway,\'94 she said.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Who cares how they\'92re \
folded?\'94 \
\'93Septa Mordane,\'94 Jon told her. \'93I don\'92t think she\'92d like Nymeria helping, either.\'94 The she-w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 lf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. \'93It\'92s just as well. I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.\'94 \
Her face lit up. \'93A present?\'94\
\'93You could call it that. Close the door
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Wary but excited, Arya c
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ecked the hall. \'93Nymeria, here. Guard.\'94 She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door. By then Jon had pulled off the rags he\'92d wrapped i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  in. He held it out to her. \
Arya\'92s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. \'93A sword,\'94 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he said in a sma
\f3 ll, h
\f1 ushed breath. \
The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel. \'93
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 his is no toy,\'94 he told her. \'93Be careful you don\'92t cut yourself. The edges are sharp enough to shave with.\'94 \
\'93Girls don\'92t shave,\'94 Arya said.\

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa\'92s legs?\'94 She giggled at him. \'93It\'92s so skinny.\'94 \
\'93So are you,\'94 Jon told her. \'93I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n\'92t hack a man\'92s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if
\f3  you\'92r
\f1 e fast
\f3  enou
\f1 gh.\'94 
\f3 \
\'93I ca
\f1 n be fast,\'94 Arya said. \
\'93You\'92ll have to work at it every day.\'94 He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back. \'93
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 ow does it feel? Do you like the balance?\'94 \
\'93I think so,\'94 Arya said.\
\'93First lesson,\'94 Jon said. \'93Stick them with the pointy end.\'94 \
Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n idiot. \'93I know which end to use,\'94 Arya said. A doubtful \
look crossed her face. \'93Septa Mordane will take it away from me.\'94 \'93Not if she doesn\'92t 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 now you have it,\'94 Jon said.\
\'93Who will I practice with?\'94 \
\'93You\'92ll find someone,\'94 Jon promised her. \'93King\'92s Landing is a true city, a thousand times
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the size of Winterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run, and ride
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  make yourself strong. And whatever you do . . . \'94 \
Arya k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ew what was coming next. They said it together.\
\'93 . . . don\'92t . . . tell . . . Sansa!\'94\
Jon m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s
\f3 sed up 
\f1 her hair. \'93I will miss you, little sister.\'94\
Suddenly she looked
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 like she \cf2 wa\cf3 s going to cry. \'93I\cf2  w\cf3 ish y
\f2 \cf2 o
\f1 \cf3 u were co\cf2 mi\cf3 ng with us.\'94 \
\'93Di\cf2 ff\cf3 erent
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 roads som
\f2\b0\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 times lead to the same castle. Who knows?\'94 He was feeling better now. He was not going to let himself be sad. \'93I better go. I\'92ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 y longer.\'94 \
Arya ran
\f3  to him f
\f1 or a last hug. \'93Put down the sword first,\'94 Jon warned her, laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses. \
When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. \'93I almost forgot,\'94 he told her. \'93All the best swords have names.\'94 \
\'93Like Ice,\'94 she said. She loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed at the blade in her hand. \'93Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.\'94 \
\'93Can\'92t you guess?\'94 Jon teased. \'93Your very favorite thing.\'94 \
Arya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. Sh
\f3 e was
\f1  that quick. Th
\f3 ey said 
\f1 it together: \
\'93Needle!\'94\
The memory of her laughter warmed him on the 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ong ride north. \

DAENERYS \
Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\'92s life must be done beneath the open sky. \

\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 rogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day. \
\'93My fellow magisters have
\f3  doub
\f1 led the size of the city guard,\'94 Illyrio told them
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 over platters of 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 oney duck 
\f3 and o
\f1 range snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo\'92s. The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her broth
\f3 er until the 
\f1 wedding. \
\'93Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos,\'94 Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her bro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant compan
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 on ever since. \
Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. \'93He can have her tomorrow, if he likes,\'94 her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. \'93So long 
\f3 as h
\f1 e pays the price.\'94 \
Illyrio waved a lang
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 id hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. \'93I have told you, all is settled. Trust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.\'94 \
\'93Yes, but when?\'94 \
\'93When the khal chooses,\'94 Illyrio said. \'93He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dot
\f3 hrak. After that, perhaps
\f1 . If the omens favor war.\'94 \
Viserys seethed with impatience. \'93I piss on Dothr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ki omens. The Usurper sits on my father\'92s throne. How long must I wait?\'94 \
Illyrio gave a massive shrug. \'93You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, another few years?\'94 \
Ser Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. \'93I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser man
\f3  may beg
\f1  a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.\'94 \
Viserys bristled. \'93Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I\'92ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.\'94 \
Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duc
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 . Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripp
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud. \
Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. \'93You woke the dragon,\'94 he screamed as he kicked her. \'93You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\'94 Her thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid . . . \
. . . until
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the day of her wedding came at last. \
The ceremony began at dawn and continued until
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the g
\f3 rass
\f1  palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightenin
\f3 g. Th
\f1 e horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare\'92s milk and Illyrio\'92s fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany\'92s ears. \
Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet \
dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal\'92s own bloodriders, but D
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ny could see the anger in her brother\'92s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused. He could do nothing but n
\f3 urse 
\f1 his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person. \
Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled unt
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 l her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry V
\f3 iserys would be if he sa
\f1 w her crying, terrif
\f3 ied of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick 
\f1 bl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she wa
\f3 ved 
\f1 it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down. \
There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 oodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have w
\f3 elcomed 
\f1 the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 were too far below to hear her. \
So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror
\f3 . \
The
\f1  sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drog
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nze medallion for the women to fight 
\f3 over. 
\f1 \
The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. \'93The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.\'94 \
Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hat was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each \
other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere. \
It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki\'92s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 button, spilling his entrail
\f1 s into the dust. As the lo
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 er died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman\'97 not even the one they had been quarreling over\'97and had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed. \
Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,\'94 he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died. \
As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he could do not to scream. She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask. \
I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again. \
When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and fea
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts. \
And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking. \
Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. \'93These are no common servants, sweet sister,\'94 her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. \'93Illyrio and I selected them personally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love.\'94 He smiled thinly. \'93She\'92s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.\'94 \
Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. \'93It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford,\'94 he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They \
were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart. \
Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . . and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different tha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 an t
\f3 hat,
\f1  as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished meta
\f3 l in t
\f1 he light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. \'93What are they?\'94 she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder. \
\'93Dragon\'92s eggs
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,\'94 said Magister Illyrio. \'93The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.\'94 \
\'93I shall treasure them always.\'94 Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she kn
\f3 ew that 
\f1 Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo. \
The khal\'92s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio an
\f3 d Ser Jo
\f1 rah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings. \'93This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 blood of my blood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.\'94 And so Khal Drogo too received his \'93bride gifts.\'94 \
Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. \'93A handsome gift, Khaleesi,\'94 Magis
\f3 ter I
\f1 llyrio 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid of the last, after he had told her what it was. \'93Most l
\f3 ucky.\'94 T
\f1 he gifts mounted up around her in great pil
\f3 es, more 
\f1 gifts
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she
\f3  cou
\f1 ld 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ant or use. \
And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush \
rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift- givers parted before him, and he led the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 horse to her. \
She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough abo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t horses to know that this was no ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke. \
Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse\'92s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illy
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 io translated. \'93Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.\'94 \
\'93She\'92s beautiful,\'94 Dany murmure
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 .\
\'93She is the pride of the khalasar, \'93 Illyrio said. \'93Custom decrees that the khaleesi must \
ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.\'94 \
Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there uncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part. \'93What should I do?\'94 she asked Illyrio. \
It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. \'93Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.\'94 \
Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palan
\f2\fs24 q
\f1\fs28 uin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ff and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees. \
And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever. \
The silver-grey filly moved with a smoo
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she 
\f3 smile
\f1 d. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laugh
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daen
\f3 erys then
\f1 , and she gave the filly her head. \
The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings. \
When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, \'93Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind.\'94 The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time. \
The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high wa
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, \'93Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before.\'94 \
The fear came back to her then, with he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  brother\'92s words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her. \
They rode out together as the star
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palace
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  behind. Khal Drogo s
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 oke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. \'93I am the blood of the dragon,\'94 she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up. \'93I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the dragon.\'94 The dragon was never afraid. \
Afterward she could not say how far or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she began to cry. \
Khal Drogo stared at her tear
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , his face strangely empty of expression. \'93No,\'94 he said. He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb. \
\'93You speak the Common Tongue,\'94 Dany said in wonder. \
\'93No,\'94 he said again. \
Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and some
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  never expected from this man. \
He put his fin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 er under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. \
Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. \'93No,\'94 he said. \
\'93Is that the only word you know?\'94 she asked him. \
Drogo did not r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ply. His long heavy braid was 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 oiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid. \
It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er. When she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick. \
Then it was his turn. He began to undress her. \
His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93No,\'94 Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. \'93No,\'94 he repeated. \
\'93No,\'94 she echoed back at him. \
He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 overed her arms and legs. She was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes. \
After a while he began to touch her
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1 \cf3 s own and\cf2  b\cf3 rushed her fingers\cf2 , \cf3 one b
\f2 \cf2 y
\f1 \cf3  one. He \cf2 ra\cf3 n a hand gently do\cf2 wn\cf3  her 
\f2 \cf2 l
\f0\b\fs38 eg. He 
\f2\b0\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 troked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine. \
It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipp
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 es stiffe
\f3 ne
\f1 d and began to ache. \
He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. \'93No?\'94 he said, and she knew it was a question. \
She took his hand and moved it down to the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wetness between her thighs. \'93Yes,\'94 she whispered as she put his finger inside her. \

EDDARD \
The summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey. \
Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown glo
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 es and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. \'93Up, Stark!\'94 he roared. \'93Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.\'94 \
\'93By all means,\'94 Ned said. \'93Come inside, Your Grace.\'94
\f3  Alyn
\f1  lifted the flap of the tent. \
\'93No, no, no,\'94 Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. \'93The camp is full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours.\'94 Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up. \
Robert set the pace, driving his 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 uge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow. \
Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 By then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. \'93Gods,\'94 he swore, laughing, \'93it feels good to get out and ride
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad.\'94 He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. \'93That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain . . . I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I\'92m going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Ned laughed. \'93I will gladly light the torch for you.\'94 \
\'93Good man!\'94 The king clapped him on t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e shoulder. \'93I\'92ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.\'94 \
A smile touched Ned\'92s lips. \'93I do believe you mean it.\'94 \
\'93I do, I do,\'94 the king said. \'93What do you say, 
\f2\fs24 N
\f1\fs28 ed? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer\'92s daughter or a tavern wench to war
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  our beds tonight.\'94 \
\'93Would th
\f3 at we
\f1  could,\'94 Ned said, \'93but we have duties now, my liege . . . to th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.\'94 \
\'93You were never the boy you were,\'94 Robert grumbled. \'93More\'92s the pity. And yet there was that one time . . . what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was . . . Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard\'92s mother?\'94 \
\'93Her name was Wylla,\'94 Ned replied with cool courtesy, \'93and I would soon
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r not speak of her.\'94 \
\'93Wylla. Yes.\'94 The king grinn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. \'93She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, e
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 en for an hour. You never told me what she looked like . . . \'94 \
Ned\'92s mouth tightened in anger. \'93Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.\'94 \
\'93Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.\'94\
\'93I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.\'94 \
\'93You are too hard
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed.\'94 He slapped a hand on his knee. \'93Well, I\'92ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times you\'92re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.\'94 \
The rising sun s
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt fingers of light through the pale 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hite mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king. \'93The barrows of the First Men.\'94 \
Robert frowned. \'93Have we ridden onto a graveyard?\'94 \
\'93There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,\'94 Ned told him. \'93This land is old.\'94 \
\'93And cold,\'94 Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. \'93Well, I did not bring you out here t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King\'92s Landing. Here.\'94 The king pulled a paper from his belt 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd handed it to Ned. \
Varys the eunuch was the king\'92s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served Ae
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d not concern Lady Arryn. \'93What is the source for this information?\'94 \
\'93Do you remember Ser Jorah Mo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 mont?\'94 \
\'93Would that I might forget him,\'94 Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Isl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king\'92s justice. Five years had passed since then. \
\'93Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pardon that would allow him to return from exile,\'94 Robert explained. \'93Lord Varys makes good use of him.\'94 \
\'93So the slaver has become a spy,\'94 Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. \'93I would rather he b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 come a corpse.\'94 \
\'93Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,\'94 Robert said. \'93Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?\'94 \
\'93Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?\'94 \
The king frowned. \'93A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\'94 \
Ned did not feign surprise; Robert\'92s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m. He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had pres
\f3 ented 
\f1 Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar\'92s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 re no more t
\f1 han babes, his new-made king had replied, \'93I see no babes. Only dragonspawn.\'94 Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark \
had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the la
\f3 st battle
\f1 s of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna\'92s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing. \
This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. \'93Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.\'94 It was said 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat Rhaegar\'92s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin\'92s soldiers had torn him from his mother\'92s breast and da
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hed his head against a wall. \
\'93And how long will this one remain an innocent?\'94 Robert\'92s mouth grew hard. \'93This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.\'94 \
\'93Nonetheless,\'94 Ned said, \'93the murder of children . . . it would be vile . . . unspeakable . . . \'94 \
\'93Unspeakable?\'94 the king roared. \'93What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unsp
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 akable. The way your lord father died, that 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as unspeakable. And Rhaegar . . . how many times do you think he raped your sister? How many hundreds of times?\'94 His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nerv
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 usly beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. \'93I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as
\f3  dead
\f1  as their dragons, and then I will p
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ss on their graves.\'94 \
Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Robert\'92s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. \'93You can\'92t get your hands on this one, can you?\'94 he said quietly. \
The king\'92s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. \'93No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy- hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he\'92s handed them over to the Dothraki. I s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ould have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.\'94 \
\'93Jon Arryn wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  a wise man and a good Hand.\'94 \
Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. \'93This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?\'94 \
\'93He would say that even a million Dothra
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 i are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,\'94 Ned replied calmly. \'93The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.\'94 \
The king 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hifted uncomfortably in his saddle. \'93Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though. I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me 
\f2\fs24 U
\f1\fs28 surper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 half a chance, they will murder me 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.\'94 \
\'93He will not cross,\'94 Ned promised. \'93And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East\'97\'94 \
The king groaned. \'93For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.\'94 \
Ned was ready for that. \'93Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name on
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm\'92s End, surely.\'94 \
He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfor
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 able. \
\'93That is,\'94 Ned finished quietly, watching, \'93unless you have already promised the honor to another.\'94 \
For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. \'93What if I have?\'94 \
\'93It\'92s Jai
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e Lannister, is it not?\'94 \
Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the bar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ahead. \'93Yes,\'94 he said at last. A single hard word to end the matter. \
\'93Kingslayer,\'94 Ned said. The rumors were true, the
\f2\fs24 n
\f3\fs28 . He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. 
\f1 \'93An able and courageous man, no doubt,\'94 he said carefully, \'93but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should h
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ld both East a
\f3 nd West.
\f1 \'94 He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters. \
\'93I will fight that battle when th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  enemy appears on the field,\'94 the king said stubbornly. \'93At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will \
be succeeding anytime soon. Don\'92t vex 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e about this, Ned, the stone has been set.\'94 \'93You
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Grace, may I speak frankly?\'94\
\'93I seem unable to stop you,\'94 Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses. \'93Can you trust Jaime Lannister?\'94 \
\'93He is my wife\'92s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.\'94 \
\'93As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen\'92s,\'94 Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  pointed out. \
\'93Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 throne I sit on.\'94 \
His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. \'93He swore a vow to protect his ki
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g\'92s life with his own. Then he opened that king\'92s throat with a sword.\'94 \
\'93Seven hell
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , someone had to kill Aerys!\'94 Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. \'93If Jaime hadn\'92t done it, it would have been left for you or me.\'94 \
\'93We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,\'94 Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. \'93Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?\'94 \
\'93I won my crown there. How should I forget it?\'94 \
\'93You took a wound from Rhaegar,\'94 Ned reminded him. \'93So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar\'92s army fled back to King\'92s Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. \'93Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. What of it?\'94 \
\'93Not our men,\'94 Ned said patiently. \'93Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the rampar
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 s, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.\'94 \
The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters
\f3  of Casterly Ro
\f1 ck, the Wardens of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered hi
\f3 s pra
\f1 yers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King\'92s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had ope
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed his city to the lions at the gate. \
\'93Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,\'94 Robert said. The anger was building in him again. \'93Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.\'94 \
\'93You were not there,\'94 Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. \'93There was no honor in that conquest.\'94 \
\'93The Others take your honor!\'94 Robert swore
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93What did any Targaryen ever know of honor
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon\'92s honor!\'94 \
\'93You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,\'94 Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had whispered. \
\'93That did not bring her back.\'94 Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. \'93The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown . . . it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe . . . and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.\'94 \
\'93I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace . . . only for what I found when I rode in
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the throne room that day,\'94 Ned said. \'93Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister\'92s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high abov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hape of a lion\'92s head. How he glittered!\'94 \
\'93This is well known,\'94 the king complained. \
\'93I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the lon
\f3 g r
\f1 ows of dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king\'92s blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister\'92s men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, \'91Have no fear, Stark. I was o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ly keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It\'92s not a very comfortable seat, I\'92m afraid.\'92 \'94 \
The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. \'93You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?\'94 He shook with laughter again. \'93Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.\'94 \
\'93Boy or man, he had no
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 right to that throne.\'94 \
\'93Perhaps he was tired,\'94 Robert suggested. \'93Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there\'92s no place else to 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1 \cf3 est your \cf2 as\cf3 s in that damnable\cf2  r\cf3 oom. 
\f2 \cf2 A
\f1 \cf3 nd he spo\cf2 ke\cf3  truly, it is a mo\cf2 ns\cf3 trous
\f2 \cf2  
\f1\fs28 uncomfortable chair. In mor
\f2\fs24 e
\f0\b\fs38  ways t
\f2\b0\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 an one.\'94 The king shook his head. \'93Well, now I know Jaime\'92s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. It\'92s all as tedious as counting
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 coppers. Come, let\'92s ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair again.\'94 He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him. \
For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 belonged in Winterfell. He belonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran. \
A man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king. \

The north went on forever. \
TYRION \
Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 sroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another. \
They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen\'92s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew. \
It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet. \
West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narro
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found. \
Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners. \
With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. \'93The wolfswood,\'94 Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. Jon Snow\'92s alb
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 no direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never raised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought. \
There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s Watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 an old root and as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. \'93Rapers,\'94 Yoren said with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration. \
Five men, three boys
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road. \
Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were matte
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel. \
No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Night\'92s Watch was made up of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life . . . or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him. \
He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother\'92s distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. \'93I warn you, Lannister, you\'92ll find no inns at the Wall,\'94 he had said, looking down on him. \
\'93No doubt you\'92ll find some place to put me,\'94 Tyrion had replied. \'93As you might have noticed, I\'92m small.\'94 \
One did not say no to the queen\'92s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not been happy. \'93You wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l not like the ride, I promise you that,\'94 he\'92d said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise. \
By the end of the first week, Tyrion\'92s thighs were raw from hard riding, his 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 egs were cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction. \
He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f Night\'92s Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered. \
Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the 
\f3 darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were 
\f1 no more roofs to shel
\f3 ter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources. \
Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected ru
\f1 de
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read. \
On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark\'92s permission, Tyrion 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north. \
He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swi
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 t-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are grea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow. \
Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King\'92s Landing for his sister\'92s wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen\'92s throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored. \
He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone \
seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He\'92d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved a
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ay, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast\'92s empty eye sockets had watched him go. \
There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiff\'92s sk
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 lls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. \
From there the skulls
\f3  rang
\f1 ed upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar\'92s gullet, although you would not ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben. \
Tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion\'92s huge, empty-eyed skull until his torch burned 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ow, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 swept across the skies, breathing fire. \
His own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That was close on three h
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ndred years ago, when the S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between them, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as many free
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 iders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers said, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain. \
The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hosts met on the broad pla
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ns of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. When the Two Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. For a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an\
end . . . but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and his sisters joined the battle. \
It was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once. The singers called it the Field of Fire. \
Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful. \
\'93Why do you read so much?\'94 \
Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, \'93Look at me and tell me what you see.\'94 \
The boy looked at him suspiciously. \'93Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.\'94 \
Tyrion sighed. \'93You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?\'94 \
\'93Fourteen,\'94 the boy said. \
\'93Fourteen, and you\'92re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ay be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver\'92s grotesqueri
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 . Alas, I was born a Lannist
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My fat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 fe is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nep
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn\'92t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind . . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.\'94 Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. \'93That\'92s why I read so much,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Jon Snow.\'94 \
The boy absorbed that all in silence. H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. \'93What are you reading about?\'94 he asked. \
\'93Dragons,\'94 Tyrion told him. \
\'93What good is that? There are no more dragons,\'94 the boy said with the easy certainty of youth. \
\'93So they say,\'94 Tyrion replie
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . \'93Sad, isn\'92t it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own.\'94 \
\'93You d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d?\'94 the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him. \
\'93Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he\'92s seated on a dragon\'92s back.\'94 Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. \'93I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I\'92d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister.\'94 Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. \'93Don\'92t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. You\'92ve dreamt the same kind
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 f dreams
\f1 .\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Jon Snow said, horrified. \'93I wouldn\'92t . . . \'94 \
\'93No? Never?\'94 Tyrion raised an e
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ebrow. \'93Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. I\'92m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 \'92s always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father . . . he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Night\'92s Watch . . . \'94 \
\'93Stop it,\'94 Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. \'93The Night\'92s Watch is a noble calling!\'94 \
Tyrion laughed. \'93You\'92re too smart to believe that. The Night\'92s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. I\'92ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it\'92s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since you\'92re not allowed to breed anywa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 , I don\'92t suppose that matters.\'94 \
\'93Stop it!\'94 the boy screamed. He took 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears. \
Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology. \
He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting le
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his teeth in frustration, grabbed a roo
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , and pulled himself back to a sitting 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 osition. \'93Help me,\'94 he said to the boy, reaching up a hand. \
And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the ground with a grunt. \'93Don\'92t help me, then. I\'92ll sit right here until you l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ave.\'94 \
Jon Snow stroked Ghost\'92s thick white fur, smiling now. \'93Ask me nicely.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in his life he had bee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. \'93I should be very
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,\'94 he said mi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 dly. \
\'93Down, G
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ost,\'94 the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Ty
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n he picked up the book and handed it bac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 . \
\'93Why did he attack me?\'94 Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand. \
\'93Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.\'94 \
Tyrion glanced
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. \'93Oh, gods,\'94 he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, \'93I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?\'94 \
\'93You don\'92t want to know.\'94 Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion. \
Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. \'93Want some?\'94 \
The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. \'93It\'92s true, isn\'92t it?\'94 he said when he \
was done. \'93What you said about the Night\'92s Watch.\'94 \
Tyrion nodded.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. \'93If that\'92s what it is, that\'92s what it is.\'94 \
Tyrion grinned at him. \'93That\'92s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard tru
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h than face it.\'94 \
\'93Most men,\'94 the boy said. \'93But not you.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Tyrion admitted, \'93not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons.\'94 He scooped 
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 p the fallen bearskin. \'93Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.\'94 \
The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. The horses had been fed a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, s
\f2\fs24 k
\f1 \cf3 inning a \cf2 sq\cf3 uirrel. The savory\cf2  s\cf3 mell 
\f2 \cf2 o
\f1 \cf3 f stew fi\cf2 ll\cf3 ed Tyrion\'92s nostri\cf2 ls\cf3 . He 
\f2 \cf2 d
\f0\b\fs38 ragged h
\f2\b0\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 mself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. \'93More pepper,\'94 he said. \
Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. \'93There you are. Jon, damn it, don\'92t go off like
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.\'94 \
\'93It was the grumkins,\'94 Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren. The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work. \
The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  hard cheese that night around their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sle
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\'92s first watch. \
Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ack at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. \
Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. \

CATELYN \
Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran\'92s sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. \'93It is past time that we reviewed 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he figures, my lady,\'94 he said. \'93You\'92ll want to know 
\f3 how m
\f1 uch this royal visit cost
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 us.\'94 \
Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rehead. It had grown very long, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. \'93I hav
\f3 e no 
\f1 need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,\'94 she told him, never taking her eyes from Bran. \'93I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.\'94 \
\'93My lady, the king\'92s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish 
\f3 our sto
\f1 re
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  before\'97\'94 She cut him off. \'93I said, take the books away. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he steward will attend to our needs.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 e have no steward,\'94 Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let go. \'93Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard\'92s household at King\'92s Landing.\'94 \
Catelyn nodded absently. \'93Oh, yes. I remembe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 .\'94 Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun. \
Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h its wick. \'93There are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory\'92s place, a new master of horse\'97\'94 \
Her eyes snapped around and fou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d him. \'93A master of horse?\'94 Her voice was a whip. \
The ma
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ster was shaken. \'93Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so\'97\'94 \
\'93My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you thi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 k I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran\'92s eyes, do you understand that? Do you?\'94 \
He bowed his head. \'93Yes, my lady, but the appointments\'97\'94 \
\'93I\'92ll make the appointments,\'94 Robb said. \
Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been sh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time. \
Maester Luwin look
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d from Catelyn to her son. \'93I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices,\'94 he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve. \
Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. \'93Good men,\'94 he said. \'93We\'92ll talk about them tomorrow.\'94 He handed back the list of names. \
\'93Very good, my lord.\'94 The paper vanished into his sleeve. \
\'93Leave us now,\'94 Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a swo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d, she saw. \'93Mother, what are you doing?\'94 \
Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  
\f3 the fir
\f1 st time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. \'93What am I doing?\'94 she echoed, puzzled. \'93How can you ask that? What do you imagine I\'92m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of Bran.\'94 \
\'93Is that what you call it? You haven\'92t left this room since B
\f3 ra
\f1 n was hurt. You didn\'92t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.\'94 \
\'93I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.\'94 She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now, couldn\'92t he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, he had told her, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d then he left, choosing. \'93I can\'92t leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last. I have to be with him, if . . . if . . . \'94 She took her son\'92s limp h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd, sliding his fingers through her own. He was so
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin. \
Robb\'92s voice softened. \'93He\'92s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.\'94 \
\'93And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at if Bran needs me and I\'92m not here?\'94 \
\'93Rickon needs you,\'94 Robb said sharply. \'93He\'92s only three, he doesn\'92t understand what\'92s happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don\'92t know what to do with him.\'94 He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he\'92d done when he was little. \'93Mother, I need you too. I\'92m trying but I can\'92t . . . I can\'92t do it all by myself.\'94 His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her ha
\f3 nd a
\f1 nd 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he could not move. \
Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second. \
\'93Bran\'92s.\'94 Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair. \
\'93Don\'92t,\'94 she told him. \'93Bran needs to stay warm.\'94 \
\'93He needs 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o h
\f3 ear t
\f1 hem sing,\'94 Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. \'93Shaggydog and Grey Wind,\'94 Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. \'93You can tell th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m apart if you listen close.\'94 \
Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  knighthood,
\f3  all
\f1  gone now, she wo
\f3 uld 
\f1 never hear him laugh agai
\f3 n. S
\f1 obbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r ears against those terrible howls. \'93Make them stop!\'94 she cried. \'93I can\'92t stand it
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!\'94 \
She didn\'92t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms. \'93Don\'92t be afraid, Mother. They wo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld never hurt him.\'94 He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. \'93Close your eyes,\'94 he said gently. \'93Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you\'92ve hardly slept since Bran\'92s fall.\'94 \
\'93I can\'92t,\'94 she wept. \'93Gods forgive me, Robb, I can\'92t, what if he dies
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 while I\'92m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies . . . \'94 The wolves were still howling. She screamed and held her ears again. \'93Oh, gods, close the window!\'94 \
\'93If you swear to me you\'92ll sleep.\'94 Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters anot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. \'93Dogs,\'94 he said, listening. \'93All the dogs are barking. They\'92ve never done that before . . . \'94 Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked up, his face was pale in the \
lamplight. \'93Fire,\'94 he whispered.\
Fire, she thought, and then, Bran! \'93H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lp me,\'94 she said urgently, sitting up. \'93Help me \
with Bran.\'94\
Robb did not seem to hear her. \'93The library tower\'92s on fire,\'94 he said. \
Catelyn could see the f
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. \'93Thank the gods,\'94 she whispered. \
Robb looked at her as if she\'92d gone mad. \'93Mother, stay h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re. I\'92ll come back as soon as the fire\'92s out.\'94 He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the roo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and three at a time. \
Outside, there were shouts of \'93Fire!\'94 in the ya
\f3 rd, s
\f1 creams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent. \
Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the sev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n faces of god as she went to the window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters. \
When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.\
\'93You weren\'92t s\'92posed to be here,\'94 he muttered sourly. \'93No one was s\'92posed to be here.\'94 \
He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand. \
Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. \'93No,\'94 she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest whisper. \
He must have heard her. \'93It\'92s a mercy,\'94 he said. \'93He\'92s dead a
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ready.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. \'93No, you can\'92t.\'94 She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him was overwhelming. \
She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hroat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were s
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his palm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumble
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. \'93You weren\'92t s\'92posed to be here,\'94 he repeated stupidly. \
Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 omething, because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she\'92d fallen. The wolf had him under the jaw. The man\'92s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half his throat. \

\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 is blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face. \
The wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It was Bran\'92s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. \'93Thank you,\'94 Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. She lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue. When it 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Bran\'92s bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically. \
That was the way they fo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nd them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. O
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth. \
Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he\'92d pulled out a handful of hair. The maester told 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er the pain was just starting now,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep. \
Finally she closed her eyes.\
When she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn no
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ded \
and sat up in bed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran\'92s fall, a terrible dream of bl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 od and grief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet strang
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ly resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her. \
\'93Bring me some bread a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d honey,\'94 she told her servants, \'93and take word to 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 aester Luwin that my bandages want changing.\'94 They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding. \
Catelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let them all down, her children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She would show these northerners how strong a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Tully of Riverrun could be. \
Robb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husband\'92s ward Theon Grey
\f2\fs24 j
\f1\fs28 oy, and lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  was the new captain of the guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she s
\f3 aw,
\f1  an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  a sword hung at his waist. \
\'93Who was h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 Catelyn asked them. \
\'93No one knows his name,\'94 Hallis Mollen told her. \'93He was no man of Winterfell, m\'92lady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.\'94 \
\'93One of the king\'92s men, then,\'94 she said, \'93or o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e of the Lannisters\'92. He could have waited behind when the others left.\'94 \
\'93Maybe,\'94 Hal said. \'93With all the
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there\'92s no way of saying who he belonged to.\'94 \
\'93He\'92d been hiding in your stables,\'94 Greyjoy said. \'93You could smell it on him.\'94 \
\'93And how could he go unnoti
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ed?\'94 she said sharply. \
Hallis Mollen looked abashed. \'93Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Night\'92s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy\'92s been acting queer, but simpl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  as he is . . . \'94 Hal shook his head. \
\'93We found where he\'92d been sleeping,\'94 Robb put in. \'93He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 eneath the straw.\'94 \
\'93It\'92s good to know my son\'92s life was not sold cheaply,\'94 Catelyn said bitterly. \
Hallis Mollen looked at her, confused. \'93Begging your grace, m\'92lady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?\'94 \
Grey
\f2\fs24 j
\f1\fs28 oy was doubtful. \'93That\'92s madness.\'94 \
\'93He came for Bran,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93He kept muttering how I wasn\'92t supposed to be 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 here. He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I hadn\'92t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Why would anyone want to kill Bran?\'94 Robb said. \'93Gods, he\'92s only a little boy, helpless, sleeping . . . \'94 \
Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. \'93If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?\'94 \
Before h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  could answer, the ser
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ants returned with a plate of fo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 d fresh from the kitchen. There was much more than she\'92d a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ked for: hot bread, butter and honey and bla
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 kberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin. \
\'93How is my son, Maester
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite. Maester Luwin lowered his eyes. \'93Unchanged, my lady.\'94 \
It was the reply she h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb. \'93Do you have the answer yet?\'94 \
\'93Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,\'94 Robb said, \'93afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of somethin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  he knows.\'94 \
Catelyn was proud of him. \'93Very good.\'94 She turned to the new captain of the guard. \'93We must
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 keep Bran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.\'94 \
\'93How many guards do you want, rn\'92lady?\'94 Hal asked.\
\'93So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,\'94 she told him. Robb stood a little taller. \'93Put one ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the \
door, two at the bottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother\'92s.\'94 \
\'93As you say, m\'92lord.\'94 \
\'93Do it now,\'94 Catelyn suggest
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. \
\'93And let his wolf 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tay in the room with him,\'94 Robb added. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Catelyn said. And then again: \'93Yes.\'94 \
Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room. \
\'93Lady Stark,\'94 Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, \'93did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?\'94 \
\'93The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,\'94 Catelyn replied wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  a dry smile. \'93Why do you ask?\'94 \
\'93We found the knife still in the villain\'92s grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 such as him. Someone gave it to him.\'94 \
Catelyn nodded, thoughtful. \'93Robb, close the door.\'94 He looked at her strangely, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 u
\f3 t di
\f1 d as she told him. \
\'93What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,\'94 she told them. \'93I want your oaths on that. If even part of what I suspect is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears cou
\f3 ld mea
\f1 n their lives.\'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard is a second father to me,\'94 said Theon Greyjoy. \'93I do so sw
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ar.\'94 \'93You have my oath,\'94 Maester Luwin said.\
\'93And mine, my lady,\'94 echoed Ser Rodrik.\
She looked at her son. \'93And you, Rob
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 \
He nodded his consent. \
\'93My sister Lysa believes
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,\'94 Catelyn told them. \'93It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hun
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  the day Bran fell. He remained here in the castle.\'94 The room was deathly quiet. \'93I do not think Bran fell from that tower,\'94 s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e said into the stillness. \'93I think he was thrown.\'94 \
The shock was plain on their faces. \'93My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,\'94 said Rodrik Cassel. \'93Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.\'94 \
\'93Oh, w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld he?\'94 Theon Greyjoy asked. \'93I wonder.\'94\
\'93There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Catelyn said. \
\'93The boy had always been surehanded in the past,\'94 Maester Luwin said th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ughtfully. \'93He knew every stone in Wint
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rfell.\'94 \
\'93Gods,\'94 Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. \'93If this is true, he will pay for it.\'94 He drew his sword and waved it in the air. \'93I\'92ll kill him myself!\'94 \
Ser Rodrik bristled at him. \'93Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away. Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?\'94 \
Abashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid to Ser Rodrik, \'93I see my son is wearing steel now.\'94 \
The old master-at-arms said, \'93I thought it was time.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
Robb was looking at her anxiously. \'93Past time,\'94 she said. \'93Winterfell may have need of all its swords
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 soon, and they had best not be made of wood.\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, \'93My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt.\'94 \
Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 here it chafed against his neck. \'93All we have is conjecture. This is the queen\'92s beloved brother we mean to 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ccuse. She will not take it kindly. We must have proof, or forever keep silent.\'94 \
\'93Your proof is in the dagger,\'94 Se
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Rodrik said. \'93A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.\'94 \
There was only one place to find the truth
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of it, Catelyn realized. \'93Someone must go to \
King\'92s Landing.\'94 \'93I\'92ll go,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93No,\'94 she told him. \'93Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.\'94 She looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and uny
\f3 ielding 
\f1 as stone. She c
\f3 limbed out of bed. \'93I must go 
\f1 my
\f2\fs24 s
\f1 \cf3 elf.\'94 \
\'93\cf2 My\cf3  lady,\'94 said Maest\cf2 er\cf3  Luwi
\f2 \cf2 n
\f1 \cf3 , \'93is tha\cf2 t \cf3 wise? Surely the L\cf2 an\cf3 niste
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38 s woul
\f2\b0\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  greet your arrival with suspicion.\'94 \
\'93What about Bran?\'94 Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. \'93You can\'92t mean to leave him.\'94 \
\'93I have done everything I can for Bran,\'94 she said, lay
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng a wounded hand on his arm. \'93His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of now.\'94 \
\'93You will need a strong escort, my lady,\'94 Theon said. \'93I\'92ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93No,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93A large party attracts unwelcome atte
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 tion. I would not have the Lannisters know I am coming.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik protested. \'93My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lone.\'94 \
\'93I will not be taking the kingsroad,\'94 Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then nodded her consent. \'93Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 lumn burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Str
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng horses and brisk winds should bring us to King\'92s Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.\'94 And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see. \

SANSA \
Eddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast. \'93The king sent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ve never seen an aurochs,\'94 Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf took it from her hand, as delicate as a queen. \
Septa Mord
\f3 ane s
\f1 niffed in disapproval. \'93A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,\'94 she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread. \
\'93She\'92s not a dog, she\'92s a direwolf,\'94 Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. \'93Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.\'94 \
The septa was not appeased. \'93You\'92re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature you\'92re as willful as your sister Arya.\'94 She scowled. \'93And wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re is Arya this morning?\'94 \
\'93She wasn\'92t hungry,\'94 Sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a br
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 akfast out of some cook\'92s boy. \
\'93Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.\'94 \
Sansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for more than a week. It was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. 
\f2\fs24 J
\f1\fs28 ust thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did not really know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she ever dreamt her prince should be, ta
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her abo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t today was Arya. Arya had a way of ruining everything. You never knew what she would do. \'93I\'92ll tell her,\'94 Sansa said uncertainly, \'93but she\'92ll dress the wa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  she always does.\'94 She hoped it wouldn\'92t be
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 too embarrassing. \'93May I be excused?\'94 \
\'93You m
\f3 ay.\'94 Septa
\f1  Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om the bench. Lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn\'92s common room. \
Outside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curse
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the ten
\f3 ts and 
\f1 pavilions and loaded the w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 gons for another day\'92s march. The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had accommodations for less than a third of the king\'92s party, which h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d swoll
\f3 en 
\f1 to more than four hundred with the addition of her father\'92s household an
\f3 d the
\f1  freeriders who had joined them on the road. \
She found Arya on the banks of the T
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ident, trying to hold
\f3  Nyme
\f1 ria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 worn yesterday and the day before. \
\'93You better
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 put on something pretty,\'94 Sansa told her. \'93Septa Mordane said so. We\'92re traveling in the queen\'92s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not,\'94 Arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria\'92s matted grey fur. \'93Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.\'94 \
\'93Rubies,\'94 Sansa said, lost. \'93What rubies?\'94 \
Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. \'93Rhaegar\'92s rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and won the crown.\'94 \
Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. \'93You can\'92t look for rubies, the princess is expecting us. The queen invited us both.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t care,\'94 Arya said. \'93The wheelhouse doesn\'92t even have windows, you can\'92t see a thing.\'94 \
\'93What could you want to see?\'94 S
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nsa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she\'92d feared. \'93It\'92s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.\'94 \
\'93It is not,\'94 Arya said stubbornly. \'93If you came with us sometimes, you\'92d see.\'94\
\'93I hate riding,\'94 Sansa said fervently. \'93All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.\'94 \
Arya shrugged. \'93Hold still,\'94 she snapped at Nymeria, \'93I
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 m not hurting you.\'94 Then to Sansa she said, \'93When 
\f3 we were cross
\f1 ing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never \
saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion.\'94 \
Sansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right on the kingsroad. Dense thickets of half- drowned trees
\f3  press
\f1 ed close around them, bran
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hes dripping with curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with eyes and teeth. \
None of which stopped Arya, of c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 urse. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all tangled and he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  supposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her worse. \
Then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on 
\f3 her arm
\f1 s. Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the itching.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sle
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p. How she had gotten those only the seven gods knew. \
Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria\'92s
\f3  tang
\f1 les and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 chattering about things she\'92d seen on the trek south. \'93Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of Nymeria.\'94 The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her. \'93Stop that, I have to do the other side, you\'92re all muddy.\'94 \
\'93You\'92re not supposed to leave the column,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Sansa reminded her. \'93Father said so.\'94 \
Arya shrugged. \'93I didn\'92t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was
\f3  with
\f1  me the whole time. I don\'92t always go off, either. Sometimes it\'92s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.\'94 \
Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squi
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 es and grooms and serving girls, old m
\f3 en a
\f1 nd naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 make friends with anybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\'92s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block. Just \
the sight of him was enough to make
\f3  San
\f1 sa feel sick, but Ar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 a seemed to prefer his company to hers. \
Sansa was running out of patience now. \'93You have to come with me,\'94 she told her sister firmly. \'93You can\'92t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.\'94 \
Arya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. \'93Come back here!\'94 \
\'93There\'92s going to be lemon cakes and tea,\'94 Sansa 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ent on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed agai
\f3 nst h
\f1 er leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, watching Arya chase Nymeria. \'93Why would you want to ride a smelly old
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t like the queen,\'94 Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 reath, shocked that even Arya would say such a thing, but her sister prattled on, he
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 dless. \'93She won\'92t even let me bring Nymeria.\'94 She thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily. \
\'93A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,\'94 Sansa said. \'93And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.\'94 \
\'93Myrcella is a little ba
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 y.\'94 Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. \'93Bad wolf!\'94 she s
\f3 houted.
\f1  \
Sansa couldn\'92t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. She gave Lady a quick little hug. 
\f3 Lady l
\f1 icked her cheek. Sansa giggled. Arya heard and whirled around, glaring. \'93I don\'92t care what you say, I\'92m going out riding.\'94 Her long horsey face got the stubborn 
\f3 look 
\f1 that meant she was going to do something willful. \
\'93Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,\'94 Sansa said. \'93I\'92ll go by myself then. It will be ever so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the le
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 on cakes and just have the best time without you.\'94 \
She turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, \'93They won\'92t let you bring Lady either.\'94 She was gone before Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria along the river. \
Alone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew Septa \
Mordane would be waiting. Lady padded quietly by her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 side. She was almost in tears. All she wanted was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 for things to be nice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. Why couldn\'92t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like Pri
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 cess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that. \
Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brothe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Jon. She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring. And Jon\'92s mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn\'92t been some mistake. Perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister. But Mother had 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nly laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa\'92s trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be true. \
As she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd had gathered around the queen\'92s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. The d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ors had been thrown open, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard her saying, \'93The council does us great honor, my good lords.\'94 \
\'93What\'92s happening?\'94 she asked a squire she knew. \
\'93The council sent riders from King\'92s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,\'94 he told her. \'93An honor guard for the king.\'94 \
Anxious to see, Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd. People moved aside hastily for the direwolf. When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink. \
One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of new- fallen snow, with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard. \
His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest- green. He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled under one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold. \
At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  kneel with the others. He stood to one side, beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked and beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of hair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman\'92s. His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard use. Above his right shoul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 er the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side. \
\'93The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,\'94 the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze. Slowly 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as overwhelming as anything San
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 a Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and bumped into someone. \
Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. \'93You are shaking, girl,\'94 he said, his voice rasping. \'93Do I frighten you so much?\'94 \
He did, and had 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ince she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the Hound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter. \
\'93A wolf,\'94 a man said, and someone else said, \'93Seven 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ells, that\'92s a direwolf,\'94 and the first man said, \'93What\'92s it doing in camp?\'94 and the Hound\'92s rasping voice replied, \'93The Starks use them for wet nurses,\'94 and Sansa realized that the two stranger kni
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hts were looking down on her and Lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her eyes. \
She heard 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he queen say, \'93Joffrey, go to her.\'94 And her prince was there. \
\'93Leave her alone,\'94 Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r his hand, drew her to her feet. \'93What is it, sweet lady? Why are you afraid? No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, that\'92s all.\'94 He looked at Sandor Clegane. \'93And you, dog, away with you, you\'92re scaring my betrothed.\'94 \
The Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Sansa struggled to steady herself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be a queen. \'93It was not him, my sweet prince,\'94 she tried to explain. \'93It was the other one.\'94 \
The two stranger knights exchanged a look. \'93Payne
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 chuckled the young man in the green armor. \
The older man in white spok
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  to Sansa gently. \'93Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. He has a fearsome aspect.\'94 \
\'93As well he should.\'94 The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The spectators parted to make way for her. \'93If the wicked do not fear the Mng\'92s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.\'94 \
Sansa finally found her words. \'93Then 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 urely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,\'94 she said, and a gale of laughter erupted a
\f3 ll
\f1  around her
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Well spoken, child,\'94 said the old man in white. \'93As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark. I am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard.\'94 He bowed. \
Sansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came back to her. \'93The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,\'94 she said, \'93and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen be
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ore him. The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds of Barristan the Bold.\'94 \
The green knight laughed again. \'93Barristan the Old, you mean. Don\'92t flatter him too sweetly, child, he thinks overm
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ch of himself already.\'94 He smiled at her. \'93Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u are truly our Hand\'92s daughter.\'94 \
Joffrey stiffened beside her. \'93Have a care how you address my betrothed.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93I can answer,\'94 Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince\'92s anger. She smiled at the green knight. \'93Your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  stag is the sigil of the royal House. King Robert has two brothers. By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm\'92s End and councillor to the king, and so I name you.\'94 \
Ser Barristan chuckled. \'93By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name him.\'94 \
There was general laughter, led by Lord Renly himself. The tension of a few moments ago was gone, and Sansa was beginning 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o feel comfortable . . . until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and stood before her, unsmiling. He did not say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low rumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. \'93I am sorry if I offended you, Ser Ilyn,\'94 she said. \
She waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul naked before him. Still silent, he t
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rned and walked away. \
Sansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. \'93Did I say something wr
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 ng, Your Gr
\f1 ace? Why will he not speak to me?\'94 \
\'93Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,\'94 Lord Renly comm
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nted wi
\f3 th a 
\f1 sly smile. \
Joffrey 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa\'92s hands in his own. \'93Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\'94 \
\'93He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,\'94 the queen said, \'93and hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  devotion to our realm is unquestioned.\'94 Then she smiled graciously and said, \'93Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ur father. I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella. Please give your sweet siste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  my apologies. Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today.\'94 \
\'93It would be my pleasure, Mother,\'94 Joffrey said very formally. He took her b
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and Sansa\'92s spirits took flight. A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully. He was so gallant, she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, why, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa from the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys\'92s honor against evil Ser Morgil\'92s slanders. \
The touch of J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ffrey\'92s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. \'93What would you like to do?\'94 \
Be with you, Sansa thought, but she said, \'93Whatever you\'92d like to do,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 my prince.\'94 Jofftey reflected a moment. \'93We could go riding.\'94 \
\'93Oh, I love riding,\'94 Sansa said. \
Joffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. \'93Your wolf is liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you. Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?\'94 \
Sansa hesitated. \'93If you like,\'94 she said uncertainly. \'93I suppose I could tie Lady up.\'94 She did not quite understand, though. \'93I didn\'92t know you had a dog . . . \'94 \
Joffrey laughed. \'93He\'92s my mother\'92s dog, in truth. She has set him to guard me, and so he does.\'94 \
\'93You mean the Hound,\'94 she said. She wanted to hit herself for being so slow. Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid. \'93Is it safe to leave him behind?\'94 \
Prince Joffrey looke
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  annoyed that she would even ask. \'93Have no fear, lady. I am almost a man grown, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd I don\'92t fight with wood like your brothers. All I need is this.\'94 He drew his sword and showed it to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd double-edged, with a leather grip and a lion\'92s- head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 over it admiringly, and Joffrey looked pleased. \'93I call it Lion\'92s Tooth,\'94 he said
\f3 . \
An
\f1 d so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion\'92s Tooth. \
It was a glorious day,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a magical day. The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers, and the 
\f3 woods here had a 
\f1 gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north. Prince Joffrey\'92s mount was a 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 lood bay courser, swift as the wind, and he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare. It was a day for adventures. They explored the caves by the riverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 und a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. They dined on tr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut fresh from the river, and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. \'93My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,\'94 she confessed to her prince. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,\'94 Joffrey said, refilling her cup. \
They went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as they rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. \'93Shouldn\'92t we be starting back?\'94 she asked. \
\'93Soon,\'94 Joffrey said. \'93The battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends. That \
was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know. He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor.\'94 Joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done. \'93Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys, and my father was king. What\'92s that soun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 \
Sansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack. \'93I don\'92t know,\'94 she said. It made her nervous, though. \'93Joffrey, let\'92s go back.\'94 \
\'93I want to see what i
\f3 t is.
\f1 \'94 Joffrey turned his horse in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  direction of the sounds, and Sansa had no choice but to follow. The noises grew louder and more distinct,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt. \
\'93Someone\'92s there,\'94 Sansa said anxiously. She found herself thinking of Lady, wishing the direwolf was with her. \
\'93You\'92re safe with me.\'94 Joffrey drew his Lion\'92s Tooth from its sheath. The 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ound of steel on leather made her tremble. \'93This way,\'94 he said, riding through a sta
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d of trees. \
Beyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl playing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at knights. Their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronge
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 , and he was pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy\'92s blows, b
\f3 ut n
\f1 ot all. 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 hen she tried to lunge at him, he caught her stick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her weapon. \
Prince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d and startled, and dropped his stick in the grass. The girl glared at them, sucking on h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. \'93Arya?\'94 she called out incredulously. \
\'93Go away,\'94 Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. \'93What are you doing here? Leave us alone.\'94 \
Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. \'93Your sister?\'94 She nodded, blushing. Joffrey examined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d
\f3  face an
\f1 d thick red hair. \'93And who are you, boy?\'94 he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fact that the other was a year his senior. \
\'93Mycah,\'94 the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and a
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 erted his eyes. \'93M\'92
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ord.\'94 \
\'93He\'92s the butcher\'92s boy,\'94 Sansa said.\
\'93He\'92s my friend,\'94 Arya said sharply. \'93You lea
\f3 ve him
\f1  alone.\'94 \
\'93A butcher\'92s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?\'94 Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand. \'93Pick up your sword, butcher\'92s boy,\'94 he said, his eyes bright with amusement. \'93Let us see how good you are.\'94 \
Mycah stood there, frozen with fear.\
Joffrey walked toward him. \'93Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little girls?\'94 \'93She ast me to, m\'92lord,\'94 Mycah said. \'93She ast me to.\'94 \
Sansa had only to glanc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  at Arya and see the flush on her sister\'92s face to know the boy was telling the truth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had made him wild. \'93Are you going to pick up your sword?\'94 \
Mycah shook his head. \'93It\'92s only a stick, m\'92lord. It\'92s not no sword, it\'92s
\f3  only a stick.\'94 \
\'93And y
\f1 ou\'92re only a butcher\'92s boy, and no knight.\'94 Joffrey lifted Lion\'92s Tooth and laid its point on Mycah\'92s cheek below the eye, as the butcher\'92s boy stood trembling. \'93That was my lady\'92s sister you were hitting, do you know that?\'94 A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah\'92s flesh, and a slow 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed line trickled down the boy\'92s cheek. \
\'93Stop it!\'94 Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick. Sansa was afraid. \'93Arya, you stay out of this.\'94 \
\'93I won\'92t hurt him . . . much,\'94 Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher\'92s boy. \
Arya went for him. \
Sansa slid off her
\f3  ma
\f1 re, but she was too slow
\f3 . A
\f1 rya
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 swung with both hands. There was a 
\f3 loud cra
\f1 ck
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as the wood split against the back of the prince\'92s head, and then everything happened at once before Sansa\'92s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 blow on Lion\'92s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head was all bloody and his 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y
\f3 es \
were on fire. S
\f1 ansa was shrieking, \'93No, no, sto
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  it, stop it, both of you, you\'92re spoiling it,\'94 but no one was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey\'92s head. She hit his horse instead, and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah. \'93Stop it, don\'92t, stop it!\'94 Sansa screamed. Joffrey slashed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted back, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding her toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn\'92t know what to do. She watched helplessly, almost blind from her tears. \
Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 there, leaping, jaws closing around Joffrey\'92s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his f
\f3 ee
\f1 t, and they rolled in th
\f3 e grass, the w
\f1 olf
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 snarling \cf2 an\cf3 d ripping at him, \cf2 th\cf3 e pri
\f2 \cf2 n
\f1 \cf3 ce shriek\cf2 in\cf3 g in pain. \'93Get it\cf2  o\cf3 ff,\'94 
\f2 \cf2 h
\f0\b\fs38 e screa
\f2\b0\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ed. \'93Get it off!\'94 \
Arya\'92s voice cracked like a whip. \'93Nymeria!\'94 \
The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya\'92s side. The prince lay in the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 rass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, \'93She didn\'92t hurt you . . . much.\'94 She picked up Lion\'92s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  holding the sword with both hands. \
Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. \'93No,\'94 he said, \'93don\'92t hurt me. I\'92ll tell my mother.\'94 \
\'93You leave him alone!\'94 Sansa screa
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 d at 
\f1 her sister. \
Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey moaned. Arya ran off to her horse, Nymeria loping at her heels. \
After they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. Sansa knelt besi
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e him. \'93Joffrey,\'94 she sobbed. \'93Oh, look what they did, look what they did. My poor prince. Don\'92t be afraid. I\'92ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.\'94 Tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair. \
His eyes snapped open and looked at her, and t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ere was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest contempt. \'93Then go,\'94 he spit at her. \'93And don\'92t touch me.\'94 \

EDDARD \
They\'92ve found her, my lord.\'94\
Ned rose quickly. \'93Our men or Lannister\'92s?\'94\
\'93It was Jory,\'94 his steward Vayon Poole replied. \'93She\'92s not been harmed.\'94 \
\'93Thank the gods,\'94 Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen\'92s men had been out hunting as well. \'93Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once.\'94 \
\'93I am sorry, my lord,\'94 Poole told him. \'93The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y informed the queen when Jory brought her in. She\'92s being taken directly before
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the king . . . \'94 \
\'93Damn that woman!\'94 Ned said, striding to the door. \'93Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. Her voice may be needed.\'94 He desc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nded the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s on him, filling him with strength. \
Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste. He would have run, but he was still the King\'92s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity. He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do. \
The castle was a mo

\f1\fs28 est holding a half day\'92s ride south of the Trident. The royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or Arya and the butcher\'92s boy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under the king\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar\'92s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king\'92s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy. \
The king had appropriated Ser Raymun\'92s audience chamber, and that was where Ned \
found them. The room was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably. \
Robert was slumped in Darry\'92s high seat at the far end of the roo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , his face closed and sullen. Cersei Lannister and her son stood be
\f3 side 
\f1 him. The queen had her hand on Joffrey\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shoulder. Thick silken bandages still covered the boy\'92s arm. \
Arya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon her. \'93Arya,\'94 Ned called loudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and beg
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n to sob. \
Ned went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. \'93I\'92m sorry,\'94 she sobbed, \'93I\'92m sorry, I\'92m sorry.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 he said. She felt so tiny in 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. It was hard to see how she had caused so muc
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  trouble. \'93Are you hurt?\'94 \
\'93No.\'94 Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. \'93Hungry some. I ate so
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e berries, but there was nothing else.\'94 \
\'93We\'92ll feed you soon enough,\'94 Ned promised. He r
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 se to face the king. \'93What is the meaning of this?\'94 His eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But for his own men, they were few enough. Ser Raymun Darry gua
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ded his look well. Lord Renly wore a half smile that mig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t
\f3  mean a
\f1 nything, and old Ser Barristan was grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of the Trident. \'93Why was I not told that my daughter had been found?\'94 Ned demanded, his voice ringing. \'93Why was she not brought to me at once?\'94 \
He spoke to Rob
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rt, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. \'93How dare you speak to your king in that manner!\'94 \
At that, the king stirred. \'93Quiet, woman,\'94 he snapped. He straightened in his seat. \'93I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly.\'94 \
\'93And what business is that?\'94 Ned put ice in his voice. \
The queen s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 epped forward. \'93You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours attacked my son. Her and her butcher\'92s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s not true,\'94 Arya said loudly. \'93She just bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.\'94 \
\'93Joff told us what happened,\'94 the queen said. \'93You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 lf on him.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s not how it was,\'94 Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her shoulder. \
\'93Yes it is!\'94 Prince Joffrey insisted. \'93They all attacked me, and she threw Lion\'92s Tooth in the river!\'94 Ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke. \
\'93Liar!\'94 Arya yell
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d.\
\'93Shut up!\'94 the prince yelled back. \
\'93Enough!\'94 the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. Silence fell. He glowered at Arya through his thick beard.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Now, child, you will tell me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is a great crime to lie to a king.\'94 Then he looked over at his son. \'93When she is done, you will ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e your turn. Until then, hold your tongue.\'94 \
As Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the hall as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 A
\f3 rya spoke. 
\f1 When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey\'92s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king b
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 istled.
\f3  \'93Ser Ba
\f1 rristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.\'94 \
Lord Renly stifled his laughter. \'93My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.\'94 He bowed to Joffrey. \'93Perchance later you\'92ll tell me ho
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the river.\'94 As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, \'93Lion\'92s Tooth,\'94 and guffaw once more. \
Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n who wanted to be anywhere but here. \'93What in all the seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another.\'94 \
\'93They were not the only ones pres
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt,\'94 Ned said. \'93Sansa, come here.\'94 Ned had heard 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. \'93Tell us what happened.\'94 \
His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until \
it shone. She blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. \'93I 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 on\'92t know,\'94 she said tearfully, looking as th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ugh she wanted to bolt. \'93I don\'92t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn\'92t see . . .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93You rotten!\'94 Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Liar, liar, liar, liar.\'94 \
\'93Arya, stop it!\'94 Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned lifted her back to her feet. \'93A
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e you hurt?\'94 he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem to hear.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,\'94 Cersei Lannister said. \'93Robert, I want her punished
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Seven hells,\'94 Robert swore. \'93Cersei, look at her. She\'92s a child. What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, chi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 dren fight. It\'92s over. No lasting harm was done
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
The queen was furious. \'93Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.\'94 \
Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. \'93So he will. Perhaps they will teach him a lesson. Ned, see that your daughter is disciplined. I will do the s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 me with my son.\'94 \
\'93Gladly, Your Grace,\'94 Ned said with vast relief. \
Robert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. \'93And what of the direwolf?\'94 she called after him. \'93What of the beast that savaged your son?\'94 \
The king stopped, tur
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed back, frowned. \'93I\'92d forgotten about the damned wolf.\'94 \
Ned cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d see Arya tense in Jory\'92s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. \'93We found no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.\'94 \
Robert did not look unhappy. \'93No? So be it.\'94 \
The queen raised her voice. \'93A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 kin!\'94 \
\'93A costly pelt,\'94 Robert grumbled. \'93I want no part of this, woman. You can damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold.\'94 \
The queen regarded him coolly. \'93I had not thought you so niggardly. The king I\'92d thought to wed would ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.\'94 \
Robert\'92s face darkened with anger. \'93That would be a fine tr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ck, without a wolf.\'94 \
\'93We have a wolf,\'94 Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with triumph. \
It took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. \'93As you wil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 . Have Ser Ilyn see to it.\'94 \
\'93Robert, you cannot mean this,\'94 Ned protested. \
The king was in no mood for more argument.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Enough, Ned, I will hear no more. A direwolf is a savage beast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he same way the other did on my son. Get her a dog, she\'92ll be happier for it.\'94 \
That was when Sansa fi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ally seemed to comprehe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d. Her eyes were frightened as they went to her father. \'93He doesn\'92t mean Lady, does he?\'94 She saw the truth on his face. \'93No,\'94 she said. \'93No, not Lady, Lady didn\'92t bite anybody, 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he\'92s good . . . \'94 \
\'93Lady wasn\'92t there,\'94 Arya shouted angrily. \'93You leave her alone!\'94 \
\'93Stop them,\'94 Sansa pl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 aded, \'93don\'92t let them do it, please, please, it wasn\'92t Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya did it, you can\'92t, it wasn\'92t Lady, don\'92t 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 et them hurt Lady, I\'92ll make her be good, I promise, I promise . . . \'94 She started to cry. \
All Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. He looked across the room at Robert. His old friend, closer than any brother. \'93Please, Robert. For the love you bear me. For the love you bore my sister. Please.\'94 \
The king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. \'93Damn you, Cersei,\'94 he said with loathing. \
Ned stood, gently disengaging himself from
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Sansa\'92s grasp. All the wearines
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  of the past four days had returned to him. \'93Do it yourself then, Robert,\'94 he said in a voice cold and s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 arp as steel. \'93At least have the courage to do it yourself.\'94 \
Robert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes an
\f3 d lef
\f1 t witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t a word, his footsteps heavy as lead. Silence filled the hall. \
\'93Where is the direwolf?\'94 Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone. Beside her, Prince Joffr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y was smiling. \
\'93The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,\'94 Ser Barristan Selmy answered reluctantly. \
\'93Send for Ilyn Payne.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned said. \'93Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.\'94 The words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out. \'93If it must 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 e done, I will do it.\'94 \
Cersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously. \'93You, Stark? Is this some trick? Why would you do such a thing?\'94 \
They were all staring at him, but it was Sansa\'92s look that cut. \'93She is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.\'94 \
He left the room with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his eyes burning and his daught
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r\'92s wails echoing in his ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a while. \'93Lady,\'94 he said, tasting the name. He ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1 \cf3  never pa\cf2 id\cf3  much attention to\cf2  t\cf3 he na
\f2 \cf2 m
\f1 \cf3 es the ch\cf2 il\cf3 dren had picked, b\cf2 ut\cf3  look
\f2 \cf2 i
\f0\b\fs38 ng at
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her now, he knew that Sansa had chosen well. She wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f3\fs28  th
\f1 e smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. She looked at him with bright
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur. \
Shortly, Jory brought him Ice. \
When it was over, he said, \'93Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at Winterfell.\'94 \
\'93All that way?\'94 Jory said
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  astonished.\
\'93All that way,\'94 Ned affirmed. \'93The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\'94 \
He was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate, back from their hunt. \
There was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. \'93No sign of
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 your daughter, Han
\f1 d,\'94 the Hound ras
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ed down, \'93but the day was not wholly wasted. We got her little pet.\'94 He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned. \
Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 all. It was th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  butcher\'92s boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blo
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 d. He had been cut almost in half from
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above. \
\'93You rode him down,\'94 Ned said. \
The Hound\'92s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog\'92s-head helm. \'93H
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28  ran.\'94 He 
\f1 looked at Ned\'92s face
\f3  and laughed. \'93But 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot very fast.\'94 \

BRAN \
It seemed as though he had been falling for years. \
Fly, a voice whispered in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the darkness, but Bran did not know how to fly, so all he could do was fall. \
Maes
\f3 ter Luwin made a little 
\f1 boy of clay, baked him till he was hard and brittle, 
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28 ressed 
\f1 him in Bran\'92s cl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 thes, and flung him off a roof. Bran remembered the way he
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 shattered. \'93But I never fall,\'94 he 
\f1 said, falling. \
The ground was so far below h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him d
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 wn there. Even in drea
\f1 ms, you could not
\f3  fall forever. He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he kn
\f1 ew. You always woke up in the instant before you hit the gr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 und. \
And if you don\'92t? the voice a
\f3 sked. \
The grou
\f1 nd was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles
\f3  away, but closer than it had been
\f1 . It was cold her
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  in the darkness. There was no sun, no stars, only the ground below coming up to smash him, and the grey mists, and the whispering voice. He wanted to cry. \
Not cry. Fly. \
\'93I can\'92t fly,\'94 Bran said. \'93I can\'92t, I can\'92t . . . \'94 \
How do you know? Have you 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ver tried? \
Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  voice was high and thin. Bran loo
\f3 ked arou
\f1 nd to see where it was
\f3  coming from. A crow was spiraling down with him, just out of 
\f1 reach, following him as he fell. \'93Help me,\'94 he said. \
I\'92m trying, the crow replied. Say,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 got any corn? \
Bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. When he pulled his hand out, golden kernels slid from between his fingers in
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 o the air. They fell wi
\f1 th him. \
The cro
\f3 w landed on his hand an
\f1 d began
\f3  to eat
\f1 . \'93
\f2\fs24 A
\f3\fs28 re you really a crow?\'94 Bran ask
\f1 ed.\
Are you real
\f3 ly fallin
\f1 g? the crow asked back
\f3 . \'93It\'92s jus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  a dream,\'94 Bran said. \
Is it? asked the crow. \
\'93I\'92ll wake up when I hit the ground,\'94 Bran told the bird. \
You\'92ll die when you hit the ground, the crow said. It went back to eating corn. \
Bran looked down. He could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, and the silver thread of rivers in d
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rk woods. He closed his eyes and began to cry. \
That won\'92t do any good, the crow said. I told you, the answer is flying, not crying. How hard can it be? I\'92m doing it. The crow took to the air and flapped around Bran\'92s hand. \
\'93You have wings,\'94 Bran pointed out.\
Maybe you do too.\
Bran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers. There are different kinds of wings, the crow said. \
Bran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember. A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. \'93The things I do for love,\'94 it said. \
Bran screamed. \
The crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it aside, put it away. It landed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on Bran\'92s shoulder, and pecked at him, and the shining golden face was gone. \
Bran was falling faster than ever. The grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below. \'93What are you doing to me?\'94 he asked the crow, tearful. \
Teaching you how to fly. \'93I can\'92t fly!\'94\
You\'92re flying tight now. \'93I\'92m falling!\'94 \
Every flight begins with a fall, the crow said. Look do
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n. \'93I\'92m afraid . . . \'94\
LOOK DOWN! \
Bran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. The ground was rushing up at him now. The whole world was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and brown and green. He could see everything so clearly that for a momen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  he forgot to be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in it. \
He saw Winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle walls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on his balcony, studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rowning as he made notes in a book. He saw his brother Robb, taller and stronger than he remembered him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. He saw Hodor, the simple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken\'92s forge, he
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool, its leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly. \
He looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the Bite. He saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and Ser Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ah
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 ad of them, 
\f1 a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning, but som
\f3 ehow they could not see it. \

\f1 He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the 
\f3 Trident. He saw his fath
\f1 er
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. \
There were shadows all around them. One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hing inside but darkness and thick black blood. \
He lifted his eyes and saw clear across the 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 arrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea and beyond, to Vaes Dothra
\f3 k under i
\f1 ts mountain, to th
\f3 e fabled lands of 
\f1 the Jade Sea, to Asshai by the Shadow, where dragons stirred beneat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  the sunrise. \
Finally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 all, past endless forests cloaked in sn
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 w, past the 
\f1 frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the heat of his tears burned on h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s cheeks. \
Now you know, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. Now you know why you must live. \
\'93Why?\'94 Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling. Because winter is coming. \
Bran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue- white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They flew up at him like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 mers impaled upon their points. He was desperately afraid. \
\'93Can a man still be brave if he\'92s afraid?\'94 he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. \
And his father\'92s voice replied to him. \'93That is the only time a man ca
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  be brave.\'94 Now, Bran, the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die.\
Death reached for him, screaming.\
Bran spread his arms and flew. \
Wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. The terrible needles of ice receded below him. The sky opened up above. Bran soared. It was better than climbing. It was better than anything. Th
\f3 e wo
\f1 rld grew small beneath him. \
\'93I\'92m flying!\'94 he cried out in deli
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht. \
I\'92ve noticed, said the three-eyed crow. It took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, blinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his 
\f2\fs24 c

\f2 \cf2 p
\f0\b\fs38 ain in t
\f2\b0\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e middle of his forehead, between his eyes. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 What are you doing?\'94 he shrieked. \
The crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a 
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 eil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r now, and then he realized that he wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  in Winterfell, in a bed high in some chilly tower room, and the black- haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps, shouting, \'93He\'92s awake, he\'92s awake, he\'92s awake.\'94 \
Bran touched his forehead, between his eyes. The p
\f3 lace where th
\f1 e crow had pecked him was still burning, but there was nothing there, no 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 lood, no wound. He felt weak and dizzy. He tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened. \
And then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs. He felt nothing. A pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun. The window was open and it was cold in the room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. His pup, Bran realized . . . or was it? He was so big now. He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf. \
When his brother Robb burst into the room, breath
\f2\fs24 l
\f3\fs28 ess from
\f1  his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran\'92s face. Bran looked up calmly. \'93His name is Summer,\'94 he said. \

CATELYN \
We will make King\'92s Landing within the hour.\'94 \
Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain. Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.\'94 \
Captain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. \'93You are far too generous, Lady Stark. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.\'94 \
\'93But they\'92ll take the silver an
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 way
\f3 .\'94 
\f1 \
Moreo smiled. \'93As you say.\'94 He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a Tyroshi accent. He\'92d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he\'92d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of his own trading galleys. The Storm Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted galley of sixty oars. \
She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 allop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley. It was good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without the galley\'92s oars they\'92d still be beating their way past the Fingers, instead of skimm
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng toward King\'92s Landing and journey\'92s end. \
So close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ngers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never again be dexte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran\'92s life. \
Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. \'93My good friend,\'94 said Moreo through his forked green beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. \'93It is so fine to see you looking better.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Ser Rodrik agreed. \'93I haven\'92t wanted to die for almost t
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 o days now.\'94 He bowed to Catelyn. \'93My lady.\'94 \
He was looking better. A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but almost himself again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him, and he\'92d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpecte
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ly off Dragonstone, yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo\'92s men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks. \
\'93The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,\'94 she said. \
Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile. \'93So soon?\'94 He looked odd without his great white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 rewman\'92s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 to the swirling winds. \
\'93I will leave you to discuss your business,\'94 Captain Moreo said. He bowed and took his leave of them. \
The galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  oars rising and falling in perfect time. Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore. \'93I have not been the most valiant of protectors.\'94 \
Catelyn touched his arm. \'93We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters.\'94 Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. \'93Now we must reach the king\'92s master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.\'94 \
\'93Ser Aron Santagar is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a vain man, but an honest one.\'94 Ser Rodrik\'92s hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once ag
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 in that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. \'93He may know the blade, yes . . . but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will know you 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n sight.\'94 \
Catelyn\'92s mouth grew tight. \'93Littlefinger,\'94 she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boy\'92s face, though he was a boy no longe
\f3 r. His father
\f1  had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Lit
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 lefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family\'92s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for his age. \
Ser Rodrik cleared his throat. \'93Lord Baelish once, ah . . . \'94 His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word. \
Catelyn was past delicacy. \'93He was my father\'92s ward. We grew up together in Ri
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 errun. I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were . . . more than brotherly. When \
it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\'92s life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my father sent him away. I have not seen him since.\'94 She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. \'93He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother\'92s place.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik\'92s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. \'93Littlefinger sits on the small council now.\'94 \
\'93I knew he would rise high,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93He was alwa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 s clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him.\'94 \
High overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the Storm Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King\'92s Landing slid into view atop its three high hills. \
Three hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth. \
Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant\'92s stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenya\'92s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, 
\f3 its bronze do
\f1 ors closed now for a century. The Street of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls rose in the distance, high and strong. \
A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. De
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 pwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd Lys. Catelyn spied the queen\'92s ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lappi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g at the water. \
And above it all, frowning down from Aegon\'92s high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge \
drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers\'92 nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. \
Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon. \
A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its wh
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 te sails huge with wind. The Storm Dance
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  moved past it, pulling steadily for shore. \
\'93My lady,\'94 Ser Rodrik said, \'93I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.\'94 \
She studied the o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyri
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n of the Free Cities. \'93You would be as much at risk as I would.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik smiled. \'93I think not. I looked at my r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 flection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myse
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe I am safe enough, my lady.\'94 \
Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, all smiles. \'93King\'92s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the castle?\'94 \
\'93We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.\'94 \
The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. \'93Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e agreed
\f3  upo
\f1 n. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.\'94 \
\'93For the oarmen,\'94 Catelyn reminded him. \
\'93Oh, of a certainty,\'94 said Moreo. \'93Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night\'92s pleasure.\'94 \
\'93There are worse t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ings to spend money on,\'94 Ser Rodrik 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ut in. \'93Winter is coming.\'94 \
\'93A man must make his own choices,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93They earned the silver. How they spend it is no concern of mine.\'94 \
\'93As you say, my lady,\'94 Moreo replied, bowing and smiling. \
Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya\'92s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d place on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large and airy
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  though, and Moreo swore that he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. Best of all, she had no interest in their names. \
\'93I think it best if you stay away from the common room,\'94 Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in. \'93Even in a place like this, on
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  never knows who may be watching.\'94 He wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pull up over his head. \'93I will be back before nightfal
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 , with Ser Aron,\'94 he promised. \'93Rest now, my lady.\'94 \
Catelyn was tired. The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had been. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep. \
She woke to a pound
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng on her door. \

\f3 Catel
\f1 yn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King\'92s Landing were red in the light of the setting sun. She had 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 lept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called out, \'93Open, in the name of the king.\'94 \
\'93A moment,\'94 she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table. She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door. \
The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the \
City Watch. Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, \'93No need for that, m\'92lady. We\'92re to escort you 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the castle.\'94 \
\'93By whose authority?\'94 she said. \
He showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey wax. \'93Petyr,\'94 she said. So soon
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik. She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 looked at the head guardsman. \'93Do you know who I am?\'94 \
\'93No, m\'92lady,\'94 he said. \'93M\'92lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated.\'94 \
Catelyn nodded. \'93You may wait outside whil
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  I dress.\'94 \
She bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brown cloak about her neck. How could Littlefinger have known she was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King\'92s Landing before her? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How . . . ? \
Then she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She hoped he\'92d gotten a good price for the information. \
They had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloak
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . When they reached the Red Keep, the portcullis was 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 own and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower. \
He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wooden table, an oil lamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. \'93Cat,\'94 he said quietly. \
\'93Why have I been brought here in this fashion?
\f3 \'94 \
He 
\f1 rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. \'93Leave us.\'94 The men departed. \'93You were not mistreated, I trust,\'94 he said after they had gone. \'93I gave firm instructi
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ns.\'94 He not
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ced her bandages. \'93Your hands . . . \'94 \
Catelyn ignored the implied question. \'93I am not accustomed to being summoned like a \
serving wench,\'94 she said icily. \'93As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.\'94 He looked contrite.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 The look brought back vivid memories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked con
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 rite
\f1 ; it was a gift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 rown into a small man,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a lit
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 le pointed chin beard
\f3  now, and threads o
\f1 f silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver. \
\'93How did you know I was in the city?\'94 she asked him. \
\'93Lord Varys knows all,\'94 Petyr said with a sly smile. \'93He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?\'94 \
Catelyn igno
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed his familiarity. There were more important questions. \'93So it was the King\'92s Spider who found me.\'94 \
Littlefinger winced. \'93You don\'92t want to call him that. He\'92s very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I imagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it happens. He has informants everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about your visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.\'94 \
\'93Why you?\'94 \
He shrugged. \'93Why not me? I am master of coin, the king\'92s own councillor. Selmy and L
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd Renly rode north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I was 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he obvious choice. I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.\'94 \
\'93Does Varys know about . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . \'94\
\'93Lord Varys knows everything . . . except why you are here.\'94 He lifted an eyebrow. \'93Why \
are you here?\'94\
\'93A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her d
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ughters close, \
who can tell her no?\'94 \
Littlefinger laughed. \'93Oh, very good, my lady, but please don\'92t expect me to believe that. I know you too well. What were the 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 ully words again?\'94 \
Her throat was dry. \'93Family,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Duty, Honor,\'94 she recited stiffly. He did know her too well. \
\'93Family, Duty, Honor,\'94 he echoed. \'93All of which required you t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  remain in Winterfell, where our Hand left you. No, my lady, something has happened. This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I beg of you, let me help. Old sweet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.\'94 There was a soft knock on the door. \'93Enter,\'94 Littlefinger called out. \
The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. \'93Lady Stark,\'94 he said, taking her hand in both of his, \'93to see you again after so many years is such a joy.\'94 His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. \'93Oh
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  your poor hands. Have you burned yourself, sweet lady? The 
\f3 fing
\f1 ers are so delicate . . . Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?\'94 \
Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. \'93I thank you, m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts.\'94 \
Varys bobbed his head. \'93I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gods are cruel.\'94 \
\'93On that we agree, Lord Varys,\'94 she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers. \
The eunuch spread his soft hands. \'93On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 she was forced to say. \'93For a certainty.\'94 \
\'93Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,\'94 quipped Littlefinger. He sm
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 led slyly. \'93At least in Lord Varys\'92s hearing.\'94 \
\'93Good lady,\'94 Varys said with great solicitude. \'93There are men in the Free 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 ities with wondrous healing powers. Say only 
\f3 the
\f1  word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.\'94 \
\'93Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,\'94 she told h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m. She would not speak of Bran, not here, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nly a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let them see her grief. \'93Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.\'94 \
Varys giggled 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ike a little girl. \'93Oh, yes. I suppose I am
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady.\'94 He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. \'93I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?\'94 \
Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know,\
unless . . . \'93What have you done to Ser Rodrik?\'94 she demanded. \
Littlefinger was lost. \'93I feel rather like the kn
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ght who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dag
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 er are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?\'94 \
\'93Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,\'94 Varys informed him. \'93I assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser Aron Sa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 tagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain
\f3  dagge
\f1 r. About sunset, they left the castle together and wal
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the common room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.\'94 \
\'93How could you know all that?\'94\
\'93The whisperings of little birds,\'94 Varys said, smiling. \'93I know things, sweet lady. That is \
the nature of my service.\'94 He shrugged. \'93You do have the dagger with you, yes?\'94 Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n
\f3  fro
\f1 nt of \
him. \'93Here. Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it bel
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ngs to.\'94 \
Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 its edge.\cf2  B\cf3 lood welled, and h\cf2 e \cf3 let o
\f2 \cf2 u
\f1 \cf3 t a squea\cf2 l \cf3 and dropped the da\cf2 gg\cf3 er ba
\f2 \cf2 c
\f0\b\fs38 k on
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the table. \
\'93Careful,\'94 Catelyn told him, 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 it\'92s sharp.\'94 \
\'93Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,\'94 Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. He flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. \'93Such sweet balance. You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have come to me.\'94 \
\'93And if I had,\'94 she said, \'93what would you have told me?\'94 \
\'93I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King\'92s Landing.\'94 He grasped the blade b

\f3 ween th
\f1 umb and forefinger, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it ac
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 oss the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It s

\f1\fs28 ruck the door and buried \
itself deep in the oak, quivering. \'93It\'92s mine.\'94\
\'93Yours?\'94 It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell. \
\'93Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey\'92s name day,\'94 he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood. \'93I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the court.\'94 Petyr\'92s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again. \'93When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 I lost my knife. Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.\'94 \
\'93Who?\'94 Catelyn demanded, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain. \
\'93The Imp,\'94 said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. \'93Tyrion Lannister.\'94 \

JON \
The courtyard rang to the song of swords. \
Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon\'92s chest as he pressed the attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 aised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy\'92s leg and sent him staggering. Grenn
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his hel
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 . When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain. \
\'93Enough!\'94 Ser Alliser Thorne h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel. \
Grenn cradled his hand. \'93The bastard broke my wrist.\'94 \
\'93The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. Or would have, if these blades had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 an edge. It\'92s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.\'94 Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad. \'93Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.\'94 \
Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on his face. He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory. \
\'93That is a longsword, not an old man\'92s cane,\'94 Ser Alliser said sharply. \'93Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?\'94 \
Jon hated that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard. \'93No,\'94 he replied. \
Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes lik
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  chips of onyx. \'93The truth now,\'94 he commanded. \
\'93I\'92m tired,\'94 Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that t
\f3 he figh
\f1 t was done. \
\'93What you are is weak.\'94 \'93I won.\'94\
\'93No. The Aurochs lost.\'94 \
One of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The ma
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ter-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse. \
\'93That will be all,\'94 Thorne told them. \'93I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for not
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ing more than arrow fodder.\'94 \
Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. Pyp used
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. Halder\'92s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them. \
Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with him here. In a few years he w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld forget what it felt like to be warm. \
The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through 
\f3 the wa
\f1 lls like blood through a man\'92s body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were co
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d here, and the people colder. \
No one had told him the Night\'92s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nly made it hurt the worse. \
Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Alliser Thorne. \
Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him. Benjen refused him
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 curtly. \'93This is not Winterfell,\'94 he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger. \'93On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You\'92re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h the smell of summer still on you.\'94 \
Stupidly, Jon argued. \'93I\'92ll be fifteen on my name day,\'94 he said. \'93Almost a man grown.\'94 \
Benjen Stark frowned. \'93A boy you are, and a boy you\'92ll remain until Ser Alli
\f3 ser says
\f1  you are fit to be a man of the Night\'92s Watch. If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. We put aside our old families when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now.\'94 He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black. \
Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle lea
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e. One of his rangers, a big ugly m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew. \'93How often must I tell you no, Jon? We\'92ll speak when I return.\'94 \
As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind\'92s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming? \
After
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ard he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur. \
If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t Jon could not find it in him to pray to any god
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , old or new. If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter. \
He missed h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s true brothers: little Rickon, bright ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, \
always wanting to follow and join in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but \'93my half brother\'94 since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya . . . he missed her even more than Robb,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had . . . yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. \
\'93You broke my wrist, bastard boy.\'94 \
Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d red of face, with three of his friends behi
\f3 nd h
\f1 im
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all called him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in the Fingers
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  He\'92d forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it. They were brutes and bullies, witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t a thimble of honor between them. \
Jon stood up. \'93I\'92ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.\'94 Grenn was sixteen and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a head taller than Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. He\'92d beaten every one of them in the yard. \
\'93Maybe we\'92ll break you,\'94 one of the rapers said. \
\'93Try.\'94 Jon reached back for his sword, but one of the
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. \
\'93You make us look bad,\'94 complained Toad. \
\'93You looked bad before I ever met you,\'94 Jon told him. The boy who had h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s arm jerked upward on him, hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out. \
Toad stepped close. \'93The little lordling has a mouth on 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im,\'94 he said. He had pig eyes, small and shin
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 . \'93Is that your mommy\'92s mouth, bastar
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her a time or two.\'94 He laug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ed. \
Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down acr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ss the instep of the boy holding him
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  There was a sudden cry of pain,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth. \
The two
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut \
through the gloom of the armory. \'93STOP THIS! NOW!\'94 \
Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ing at them. \'93The yard is for fighting,\'94 the armorer said. \'93Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I\'92ll make them my quarrels. You won\'92t lik
\f3 e tha
\f1 t.\'94 \
Toa
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  sat on the f
\f1 loor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody. \'93He tried to kill me.\'94 \
\'93 \'92S true. I saw it,\'94 one of the rapers put in.\
\'93He broke my wrist,\'94 Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection. \
The armorer 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. \'93A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maester Aemon will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your cells. Not 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou, Snow. You stay.\'94 \
Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retributi
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n. His arm was throbbing. \
\'93The Watch has need of every man it can get,\'94 Donal Noye said when they were alone. \'93Even men like Toad. You won\'92t win any honors killing him.\'94 \
Jon\'92s anger flared. \'93He said my mother was\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97a whore. I heard him. W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at of it?\'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,\'94 Jon said icily. \'93His honor\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?\'94 \
Jon was cold with rage. \'93Can I go?\'94 \
\'93You go when I tell you to go.\'94 \
Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around. \'93Look at me when I\'92m talking to you, boy.\'94 \
Jon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. \'93Words \
won\'92t make your mother a whore. She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.\'94 \
Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind. \
\'93You think you had it hard, being a high lord\'92s bastard?\'94 the armorer went on. \'93That boy Jeren is a septon\'92s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Ea
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 twa
\f3 tch b
\f1 y the Sea.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t care,\'94 Jon said. \'93I don\'92t care about them and I don\'92t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it. I hate it 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ere. It\'92s too . . . it\'92s cold.\'94 \
\'93Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that\'92s the Wall, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you\'92re here for life, same as the rest of us.\'94 \
\'93Life,\'94 Jon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He\'92d had one. He\'92d only taken the black after he\'92d lost an arm at the siege of Storm\'92s End. Before that he\'92d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king\'92s brot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er. He\'92d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he\'92d feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who\'92d forged King Rober
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He\'92d done
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he\'92d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the Wall, when his life was all but over. \
\'93Yes, life,\'94 Noye said. \'93A long life or a short one, it\'92s up to you, Snow. The road you\'92re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.\'94 \
\'93They\'92re not my brothers,\'94 Jon snapped. \'93They hate me because I\'92m better than they are.\'94 \
\'93No. They hate you because you act like you\'92re better than they are. They look at you an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he\'92s a lordling.\'94 The armorer leaned close. \'93You\'92re no lordling. Remember that. You\'92re a Snow, not a Stark. You\'92re a b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 stard and a bully.\'94 \
\'93A bully?\'94 Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ook his breath away. \'93They were the ones who came after me. Four of them.\'94 \
\'93Four that you\'92ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I\'92ve \
watched you fight. It\'92s not training with you. Put a good edge on your sword, and they\'92d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave them nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?\'94 \
Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn\'92t he? But the armorer was taking that a
\f3 way t
\f1 oo, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. \'93They\'92re all older t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 an me,\'94 he said defensively. \
\'93Older and bigger and stronger, that\'92s the truth. I\'92ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?\'94 \
\'93Ser Rodrik Cassel,\'94 Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him. \
Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon\'92s face. \'93Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmer
\f3 s and wagonmen and poachers,
\f1  smiths and miners a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.\'94 His look was grim. \'93So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t call me that!\'94 Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. \'93I never . . . I didn\'92t think . . . \'94 \
\'93Best you start thinking,\'94 Noye warned him. \'93That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. Now go.\'94 \
By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken through the clouds. He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, bla
\f2\fs24 z
\f1\fs28 ing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky . . . but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky. \
The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. \'93And beyond a doubt the most useless,\'94 Tyrion Lannister had added with a 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 rin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, st
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 etching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say. \
When they finally spied Castle B
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ack, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from the south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night\'92s Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e stronghold it sheltered. His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast. The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants. \
As he stood outside the armory l
\f3 ook
\f1 ing up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t day on the kingsroad, when he\'92d seen it for the first time. The Wall was like that. S
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 metimes he could almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and when he stood beneath it and looked up, it 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ade Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 mehow Jon knew that if it f
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll, the world fell with it. \
\'93Makes you wonder what lies beyond,\'94 a familiar voice said.\
Jon looked around. \'93Lannister. I didn\'92t see\'97I mean, I thought I was alone.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. \'93There\'92s much to be said for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.\'94 \
\'93You won\'92t learn anything from me,\'94 Jon told him. He had seen lit
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 le of the dwarf since their journey ended. As the queen\'92s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night\'92s Watch. The Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King\'92s Tower\'97so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred years\'97and Lannister dined at Mormont\'92s own table an
\f3 d spen
\f1 t his days riding the Wall and his nights dicing and drinkin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high off
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 cers. \
\'93Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.\'94 The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking stick. \'93As I was saying . . . why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediate
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y needs to know what\'92s on the other side?\'94 He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes. \'93You do want to know what\'92s on the other side, don\'92t you?\'94 \
\'93It\'92s nothing special,\'94 Jon said. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, \
deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder\'92s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. \'93The rangers say it\'92s just woods and mountains and frozen
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lakes, with lots of snow and ice.\'94 \
\'93And the grumkins and the snarks,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what\'92s that big 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hing for?\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t call me Lord Snow.\'94 \
The dwarf lifted an eyebrow. \'93Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you, and you\'92ll never be
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can\'92t hurt you with it anymore.\'94 He gestured with his stick. \'93Come, walk with me. They\'92ll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.\'94 \
Jon was hungry too, so he fell in be
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ide Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf\'92s awkward, waddling steps. The wind was ri
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ing, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy sh
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 tter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them. \
\'93I don\'92t see your wolf,\'94 Lannister said as they walked. \
\'93I chain him up in the old stables when we\'92re training. They board all the horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin\'92s Tower.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like our noble
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 king Robert after a long night\'92s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.\'94 \
Jon shrugged. \'93No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell you 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ant.\'94 Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin. \
Tyrion Lannister\'92s laughter steamed in the cold air. \'93I\'92ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.\'94 \
Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still oc
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 upied: \
Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  manned 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he parapets. \
\'93It\'92s better that I\'92m by myself,\'94 Jon said stubbornly. \'93The rest of them are scared of Ghost.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Wise boys,\'94 Lannister said. Then he chang
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the subject. \'93The talk is, your uncle is too long away.\'94 \
Jon remembered the wish he\'92d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not wa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t him to see the guilt in his eyes. \'93He said he\'92d be back by my name day,\'94 he admitted. His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a fortnight past
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to Lord Arryn. Uncle Benjen 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. That\'92s all the way up in the mo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ntains.\'94 \
\'93I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,\'94 Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. \'93Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.\'94 \
Inside, the hall w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a hee
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  of black bread from the day\'92s cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 rough voices. Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners. \
Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. \'93Barley, onion, carrot,\'94 he muttered. \'93Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn\'92t a meat.\'94 \
\'93It\'92s mutton stew.\'94 Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. The smell made his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mouth water. \
\'93Snow.\'94 \
Jon knew Alliser Thorne\'92s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. He turned. \
\'93The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.\'94 \
For a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. \'93Is it m
\f3 y un
\f1 cle?\'94 he blurted. \'93Is he returned sa
\f3 fe?\'94
\f1  
\f3 \
\'93Th
\f1 e L
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd Commander is not accustomed to waiting,\'94 was Ser Alliser\'92s reply. \'93And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. \'93Stop it, Thorne. You\'92re frightening the boy.\'94 \
\'93Keep out of matters that d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n\'92t concern you, Lannister. You have no place here.\'94 \
\'93I have a place
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at court, though,\'94 the dwarf said, smiling. \'93A word in the right ear, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you\'92ll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train. Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him. Is there news of his uncle?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ser Alliser said. \'93This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a messag
\f3 e that conc
\f1 er
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 s his brother.\'94 He corrected himself. \'93His half brother.\'94 \
\'93Bran,\'94 Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. \'93Something\'92s happened to Bran.\'94 Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. \'93Jon,\'94 he said. \'93I am truly sorry.\'94 \
Jon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion\'92s hand and strode across the hall. He was running by the time he hit the doors.
\f3  He raced to the Comma
\f1 nder\'92s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the guards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. By th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  time he burst into the presence of the Lord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. \'93Bran,\'94 he said. \'93What does it say about Bran?\'94 \
Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night\'92s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn. \'93I am told you can read.\'94 He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d handed it to Jon. \'93Corn,\'94 it muttered in a raucous voice. \'93Corn, corn.\'94 \
Jon\'92s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. He recogni
\f2\fs24 z
\f1\fs28 ed Robb\'92s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. He realized he was crying. And then, through the tears, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  found the sense in the words, \
and raised his head. \'93He woke up,\'94 he said. \'93The gods gave him back.\'94 \
\'93Crippled,\'94 Mormont said. \'93I\'92m sorry, boy. Read the rest of the letter.\'94 \
He looked at the words, but they didn\'92t matter. Nothing mattere
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . Bran was going to live. \'93My brother is going to live,\'94 he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, \'93Live! Live!\'94 \
Jon ran down
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 the stair\cf2 s,\cf3  a smile on his fa\cf2 ce\cf3  and 
\f2 \cf2 R
\f1 \cf3 obb\'92s let\cf2 te\cf3 r in his hand. \'93My\cf2  b\cf3 rothe
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38  is goi
\f2\b0\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g to live,\'94 he told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him around in a circle. \'93Bran is going to live!\'94 he whooped. Lannister looked startled. Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands. \'93Here, read it,\'94 he said. \
Others were gathering around and looking at him curio
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 sly. Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away. A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne hand. He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all. Jon went to him. Grenn edged backward and put up his hands. \'93Stay away from me now, you bastard.\'94 \
Jon smiled 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t him. \'93I\'92m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on me once, only with a wooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. Look, if you wan
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , I can show you how to defend that.\'94 \
Alliser Thorne overheard him. \'93Lord Snow wants to take my place now.\'94 He sneered. \'93I\'92d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,\'94 Jon said. \'93I\'92d love to see Ghost juggle.\'94 Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell. \
Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he cooks joined in. The birds stirred in the rafte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle. \
Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his sword hand
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 curled into a fist. \'93That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,\'94 he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy. \

EDDARD \
Eddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. He was still ahorse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a feath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rbed, when the king\'92s steward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urge
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t meeting of the small council. The honor of the Hand\'92s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \'93It will be convenient on the morrow,\'94 Ned snapped as he dismounted. \
The steward bowed very low. \'93I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\'94 \
\'93No, damn it,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \'93I will see them. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\'94 \
\'93Yes, my lord,\'94 the steward said. \'93We have given you Lord Arryn\'92s former chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.\'94 \
\'93My thanks,\'94 Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called out
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.\'94 Poole bowed. Ned tu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ned back to the royal steward. \'93My wagon
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.\'94 \
\'93It will be my great pleasure,\'94 the steward sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d. \
And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bone-tired and dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for him. \
The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner 
\f3 a hu
\f1 ndred fabulous be
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 sts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls were hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes of p
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 lished garnet smoldering in black marble faces. \
The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \
\'93Lord Star
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 , I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  His hand left powder stains on Ned\'92s sleeve, and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave. \
\'93Your gods have heard you,\'94 Ned r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 plied, cool yet polite. \'93The prince grows stronger every day.\'94 He disentangled himself from the eunuch\'92s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the scree
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n so like his brother that Ned found it disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the Trident. \
\'93I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,\'94 Renly said. \
\'93And you as well,\'94 Ned replied. \'93You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your brother Robert.\'94 \
\'93A poor copy,\'94 Renly said with a shrug. \
\'93Though much better dressed,\'94 Littlefinger quipped. \'93Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.\'94 \
It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. \'93There are worse crimes,\'94 Renly said with a laugh. \'93The way you dress, for one.\'94 \
Littlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \'93I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.\'94 \
\'93She has,\'94 Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of the comment rankled him. \'93I understand yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  knew my brother Brandon as well.\'94 \
Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled ove
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  to listen. \
\'93Rather too well,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?\'94 \
\'93Often, and with some heat,\'94 Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience w
\f3 ith this game they played, this dueling
\f1  with words. \
\'93I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93Here in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.\'94 Ned moved to the council table and said, \'93Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.\'94 \
The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \'93Well e
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ough for a man of my years, my lord,\'94 he replied, \'93yet I do tire easily, I fear.\'94 Wis
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 y strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester\'92s collar was no sim
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 le metal choker such as Luwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a p
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nderous metal necklace tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  covered him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \'93Perhaps we might begin soon,\'94 the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \'93I fear I shall fall asleep if we w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 it much longer.\'94 \
\'93As you will.\'94 The king\'92s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \'93My lords,\'94 he said formally, \'93I am sorry to ha
\f3 ve k
\f1 ept you waiting.\'94 \
\'93You are the King\'92s Hand,\'94 Varys said. \'93
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 e serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.\'94 \
As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, in this room, with the
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e men. He remembered what Robert had tol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  him in the crypts below Winterfell. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. \'93We are b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t five,\'94 he pointed out. \
\'93Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,\'94 Varys said, \'93and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as he makes his way through t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e city, as befits the Lord Commander of the 
\f2\fs24 K
\f1\fs28 ingsguard.\'94 \
\'93Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,\'94 Ned sugges
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed. \
Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. \'93If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could be a long sit.\'94 \
\'93Our good King Robert has many cares,\'94 Varys said. \'93He entrusts some small matters to \
us, to lighten his load.\'94 \
\'93What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s,\'94 Lord Renly said, \'93so it falls to us to govern the
\f3  realm. He doe
\f1 s send us a command fr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 m time to time.\'94 He drew
\f3  a t
\f1 ightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \'93This morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Py
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 elle to convene this council at once. He has an urgent task for us.\'94 \
Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king\'92s urgent command, rea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ing the words with mounting disbelief. Was there no end to Robert\'92s folly? And to do this in his 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ame, that was salt in the wound. \'93Gods be good,\'94 he swore. \
\'93What Lord Eddard means to 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ay,\'94 Lord Renly announced, \'93is that His Grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.\'94 \
\'93How much?\'94 asked Littlefinger, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ildly. \
Ned read the answer off the letter. \'93Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand to the man who
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the arche
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y competition.\'94 \
\'93Ninety thousand gold pieces,\'94 Littlefinger sighed. \'93And we mus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  not neglect the other costs. Robert will want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools . . . \'94 \
\'93Fools we have in plenty,\'94 Lord Renly said. \
Grand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, \'93Will the treasury bear the expense?\'94 \
\'93What treasury is that?\'94 Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \'93Spare me the foolishness, Maester. You know as well as I that the tre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 sury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No doubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what matter another hundred thousand?\'94 \
Ned was stunned. \'93Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\'94 \
\'93The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of \
Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I\'92ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.\'94 \
Ned was aghast. \'93Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?\'94 \
Littlefinger gave a shrug. \'93The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.\'94 \
\'93I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,\'94 Ned said hotly. \
Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \'93Lord 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 rryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise cou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 sel.\'94 \
\'93My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\'94 Renly Baratheon said, \'93and he loathes what he calls \'91counting coppers.\'92 \'94 \
\'93I will speak with 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 is Grace,\'94 Ned said. \'93This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\'94 \
\'93Speak to him as you will,\'94 Lord Renly said, \'93we had still best make our plans.\'94 \
\'93Another day,\'94 Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but firs
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  among equals. \'93Forgive me, my lords,\'94 he said in a softer tone. \'93I am tired. Let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher.\'94 He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, and m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 de for the door. \
Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the y
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours be
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned\'92s liking. He had only to look at Sansa\'92s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told her that it shou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butcher\'92s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell. \
He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portculli
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  into the inner bailey, and was \
walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. \'93You\'92re going the wrong way, Stark. Come with me.\'94 \
Hesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel alo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g the walls. They were relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and forgotten. \'93This is not the way to my chambers,\'94 Ned said. \
\'93Did I say it was? I\'92m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 r corpse up behind a wall,\'94 Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \'93We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife awaits.\'94 \
\'93What game are you 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 laying, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\'94 \
\'93Oh?\'94 Littlefinger\'92s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. \'93Then it appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don\'92t come, and I\'92ll keep her for myself.\'94 He hurried down the steps. \
Ned f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 llowed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 finger. \
At the foot of the steps was a h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 avy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \'93We\'92
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e outside 
\f3 th
\f1 e castle,\'94 Ned said. \
\'93You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\'94 Littlefinger said with a sm
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rk. \'93Was it the sun that gave it away, or the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.\'94 With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey. \
Ned studied the rocky face of the blu
\f3 ff for a mo
\f1 me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t, then followed more slowly. The niches were there, as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where to look 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to. \
When at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water\'92s edge, Li
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 tlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. \'93You are growing old and slow, Stark,\'94 he said, flipping the apple casually into the \
rushing water. \'93No matter, we ride the rest of the way.\'94 He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted behind him, down the trail and into the city. \
Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramsh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ckle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk. The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sounds of music and raucous laughter dri
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ted out and floated over the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red glass. \
Ned Stark dismounted in a fury. \'93A brothel,\'94 he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around. \'93You\'92ve brought m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  all this way to take me to a brothel.\'94 \
\'93Your wife is inside,\'94 Littlefinger said. \
It was the final insult. \'93Brandon was too kind to you,\'94 Ned said as he slammed the small man ba
\f3 ck ag
\f1 ainst a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  chin beard. \
\'93My lord, no,\'94 an urgent voice call
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d out. \'93He speaks the truth.\'94 There were footsteps behind him. \
Ned spun
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \'93This is no business of yours,\'94 Ned began; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. \'93Ser Rodrik?\'94 \
Rodrik Cassel nodded. \'93Your lady awaits you upstairs.\'94 \
Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  was lost. \'93Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger\'92s?\'94 He sheathed his blade. \
\'93Would that it were, Stark,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King\'92s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d fondle a breast or two, just in passing.\'94 \
They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pret
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 y young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps. No one paid Ned the least bit of at
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ention. Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door. \
Inside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely. \
\'93My lady,\'94 Ned whispered in wonderment. \
\'93Oh, very good,\'94 said Littlefinger, closing the door. \'93You reco
\f3 gnized her.\'94 \
\'93I feared you\'92d never come, my lord,\'94
\f1  she whispered against his chest. \'93Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince. How are m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  girls?\'94 \
\'93Both in mourning, and full of anger,\'94 he told her. \'93Cat, I do not unders
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 and. What are you doing in King\'92s Landing? What\'92s happened?\'94 Ned asked his wife. \'93Is it Bran? Is he . . . \'94Dead was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it. \
\'93It is Bran, but not as you think,\'94 Catelyn said. \
Ned was lost. \'93Then how? Why are y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u here, my love? What is this place?\'94 \
\'93Just what it appears,\'94 Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?\'94 He smiled. \'93As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King\'92s Landing.\'94 \
\'93Why?\'94 Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \'93You\'92ve been hurt.\'94 He took her hands in his own, turned them over. \'93Gods. Those are deep cuts . . . a gash from a sword 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r . . . how did this happe
\f3 n, m
\f1 y lady?\'94 \
Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \'93This blade was sent to open Bran\'92s throat and spill his li
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 e\'92s blood.\'94 \
Ned\'92s head jerked up. \'93But . . . who . . . why would . . . \'94\
She put a finger to his lips. \'93Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and Littlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. Bran\'92s wolf ha
\f3 d s
\f1 aved the boy\'92s life, he 
\f3 tho
\f1 ught dully. What was it that Jon had said when th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y found the pups in the snow? Your children were 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 eant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa\'92s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he done? \
Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \'93The Imp\'92s \
dagger,\'94 he repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. \'93Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has never done him harm.\'94 \
\'93Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?\'94 Littlefinger asked. \'93The Imp would never have acted alone.\'94 \
Ned rose and paced the length of the room
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93If the queen had a role in this or, gods forbid, the king himself . . . no, I will not believe that.\'94 Yet even as he said the words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert\'92s talk of sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He rememb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red Rhaegar\'92s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d turned away in Darry\'92s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear Sansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once. \
\'93Most likely the king did not know,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.\'94 \
Ned had no reply for
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that. The face of the butcher\'92s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot a word. His head was pounding. \
Littlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \'93The accusation is treason either way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. The queen . . . if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps . . . \'94 \
\'93We have proof,\'94 Ned s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. \'93We have the dagger.\'94 \
\'93This?\'94 Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \'93A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with his hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\'94 He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. \'93My counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ged.\'94 \
Ned regarded him coldly. \'93Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying. He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.\'94 \
\'93A fool I may be, Stark . . . yet I\'92m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen gra
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e for some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be included in th
\f3 e party, thank
\f1  \
you very much.\'94\
\'93You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.\'94 \
\'93You wound me deeply.\'94 Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. \'93For my part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. I shall try to keep you alive for her sake. A fool\'92s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.\'94 \
\'93I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arr
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 n\'92s death,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93He has promised to help y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u find the truth.\'94 \
That was not news that Eddard Stark welcomed, but it was true enough that they needed he
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 p, and Littlefinger had been almost a brother to Cat once. It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised. \'93Very well,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  he said, thrusting the dagger into his belt. \'93You spoke of Varys. Does the eunuch know all of it?\'94 \
\'93Not from my lips,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93You did not wed a fool, Eddard Stark. But Varys has ways of le
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rning things that no man could know. He has some dark art, Ned, I swear it.\'94 \
\'93He has spies, that is well known,\'94 Ned said, dismissive. \
\'93It is more than th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t,\'94 Catelyn insisted. \'93Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aro
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation. I fear that man.\'94 \
Littlefinger smiled. \'93Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  If you will permit me a small obscenity\'97and where better for it\'97I hold the man\'92s balls in the palm of my hand.\'94 He cupped his fingers, smiling. \'93Or would, if he were a man, or had any balls. You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not like 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat. Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the eunuch.\'94 \
Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that. He was thinking back to the day Arya had been found, to the look on the queen\'92s 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace when she said, We have a wolf, so soft and quiet. He was thinking of the boy Mycah, of Jon Arryn\'92s sudden death, o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  Bran\'92s f
\f3 all, of 
\f1 old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  of his throne room while his life\'92s blood dried on a golden blade. \'93My lady,\'94 he said, turning to Catelyn, \'93there is nothing more you can do here. I want you to return to Winterfell at once. If there was one assassin, there could be others. Whoever ordered Bran\'92s death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives.\'94 \
\'93I had hoped to see the girls . . . \'94 Catelyn said. \
\'93That would be most unwise,\'94 Littlefinger put in. \'93The Red Keep is full of curious eyes, and children talk.\'94 \
\'93He speaks truly, my love,\'94 Ned told her. He embraced h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r
\f3 . \'93T
\f1 ake Ser Rodrik and ride for Winterfell. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  will watch over the girls. Go home to our sons and keep them safe.\'94 \
\'93As you say, my lord.\'94 Catelyn lifted her face, and Ned kissed her. Her maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength, as if to hold him safe forever in the shelter of her arms. \
\'93Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?\'94 asked Littlefinger. \'93I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.\'94 \
\'93A moment alone, that\'92s all I ask,\'94 Catelyn
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said. \
\'93Very well.\'94 Littlefinger strolled to the door. \'93Don\'92t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eturned to the castle, before our absence is noted.\'94 \
Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \'93I will not forget the help you 
\f3 gave me, Petyr. When your men came for me
\f1 , I did not know whether
\f3  they were taking me to a friend or 
\f1 an
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 enemy. I \cf2 ha\cf3 ve found you more \cf2 th\cf3 an a 
\f2 \cf2 f
\f1 \cf3 riend. I \cf2 ha\cf3 ve found a brother\cf2  I\cf3 \'92d th
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38 ught lo
\f2\b0\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t.\'94 \
Petyr Baelish smiled. \'93I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tell anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.\'94 \
Ned believed not a word
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, \'93You have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.\'94 \
\'93Oh, now there\'92s a treasure,\'94 Littlefinger said, exiting. \
When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. \'93Onc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Harbor, and see that they are well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon G
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father\'92s fleet.\'94 \
\'93War?\'94 The fear was plain on Catelyn\'92s face
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
\'93It will not come to that,\'94 Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. \'93The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Ta
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 garyen learned to his sorrow, but they woul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. I must play out this fool\'92s masquerade as 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 f nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my lo
\f3 ve. I
\f1 f I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn . . . \'94 \
He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. \'93If,\'94 she said, \'93what then, my love?\'94 \
That was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. \'93All justice flows from the king,\'94 he told her. \'93When I know the truth, I must go to Robert.\'94 And pray that he is the man I think he is,
\f3  he finished sile
\f1 nt
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y, and not the man I fear he has become. \

TYRION \
Are you certain that you must leave us so soon?\'94 the Lord Commander asked him. \
\'93Past certain, Lord Mormont,\'94 Tyrion replied. \'93My
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brother Jaime will be wondering what has become of me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Would that I could.\'94 Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear. \'93You\'92re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of your sort on th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Wall.\'94 \
Tyrion grinned. \'93Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord Mormont.\'94 As they laughed, he sucked the meat fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent. \
Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. \'93Lannister mo
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ks us.\'94 \
\'93Only you, Ser Alliser,\'94 Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain quality to it. \
Thorne\'92s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. \'93You have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Why?\'94 asked Tyrion. \'93The crabs are here.\'94 \
The remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. \'93Come and make your japes with steel in your hand.\'94 \
Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. \'93Why, I ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork. Shall we duel?\'94 He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne\'92s chest with the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander\'92s mouth as he began to gasp and choke
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. \'93Duel! Duel! Duel!\'94 \
Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it looked as thoug
\f3 h h
\f1 e had a dagger up his butt. \
Mormont
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. \'93To the victor goes the spoils,\'94 he called out. \'93I claim Thorne\'92s share of the crabs.\'94 \
Finally the L
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd Commander recovered himself. \'93You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,\'94 he 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 colded. \
Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. \'93If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.\'94 \
\'93Not so,\'94 objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as roun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and red as a pomegranate. \'93You ought to hear the droll names he giv
\f3 es the
\f1  lads he trains.\'94 \
Tyri
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n had heard a few of those droll names. \'93I\'92ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,\'94 he said. \'93Chip t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young warriors.\'94 \
\'93The Watch has
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 no shortage of stableboys,\'94 Lord Mormont grumbled. \'93That seems to be all they send us these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought br
\f3 avely
\f1  at King\'92s Landing.\'94 \
\'93On the wrong side,\'94 Ser Jaremy Rykker comme
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ted dryly. \'93I ought to know, I was there on the battlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.\'94 \
\'93None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  people who have annoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King\'92s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there.\'94 \
\'93Thank you,\'94 Ser Jaremy replie
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  with a sardonic smile.\
Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. \'93Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you \
true, Tyrio
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 . You do mock us and our noble purpose here.\'94 \
Tyrion shrugged. \'93We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously. More wine, please.\'94 He held out his cup. \
As Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, \'93You have a great thirst for a small man.\'94 \
\'93Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,\'94 Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. He spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night\'92s Watch all fell quiet, the better to 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ear what the ancient had to say. \'93I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.\'94 \
Tyrion answered gently, \'93I\'92ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.\'94 \
\'93Nonetheless,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion\'92s face, \'93I think it is true.\'94 \
For once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and say, \'93You are too kind, Maester Aemon.\'94 \
The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester\'92s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. \'93I have been called many things, my lord,\'94 he said, \'93but kind is seldom one of them.\'94 This time Tyrion himself led th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  laughter. \
Much later, when the serious busi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ess of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. \'93The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,\'94 the Lord Commander told him as they drank. \
\'93I have Jyck and Morrec,\'94 Tyrion said, \'93and Yoren is riding south again.\'94 \
\'93Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,\'94 Mormont announced 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n
\f3  a t
\f1 one that brooked no argument. \'93Three men should be sufficient.\'94 \
\'93If you insist, my lord,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93You might se
\f3 nd y
\f1 oung Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see his brothers.\'94 \
Mormont frowned through his thick g
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ey beard. \'93Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own blood kin . . . my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son\'92s dishonor. I have nieces I have never seen.\'94 He took a swallow. \'93Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have
\f3  th
\f1 ree strong swords, to keep you safe.\'94 \
\'93I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.\'94 The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something f
\f3 rom h
\f1 im. \'93I hope I can repay your kindness.\'94 \
\'93You can,\'94 Mormont said bluntly. \'93Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven 
\f3 King
\f1 doms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night\'92s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.\'94 \
\'93Three and a third,\'94 Tyrion said with a yawn. \
Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. \'93I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce\'92s s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ommand, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ny in the Watch. More fool I.\'94 \
\'93Fool,\'94 the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. \'93Fool,\'94 it called again. Dou
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 tless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity. \
The Lord Commander took no noti
\f3 ce of the 
\f1 irritating bird. \'93Gared was near as old as I am and longer o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the W
\f3 al
\f1 l,\'94 he went on, \'93yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One deserter and two men lost, and now Ben Sta
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k too has gone missing.\'94 He sighed deeply. \'93Who am I to send searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night\'92s Watch has become an
\f3  army
\f1  of sullen boys and tired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 o to stay alive.\'94 \
He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Morm
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nt had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve any meaning. \'93I promise, the king will hear of your need,\'94 Tyrion said gravely, \'93and I will speak to my father and my brother Jaime as well.\'94 And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as g
\f3 ood 
\f1 as his word. He left the rest unsaid; that King \
Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh. \
\'93You are a young man, Tyri
\f3 on,
\f1 \'94 Mormont said. \'93How many winters have you seen?\'94 He shr
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 gged. \'93Eight, nine. I misremember.\'94\
\'93And all of them short.\'94 \
\'93As you say, my lord.\'94 He had been born in the dead of wint
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r, a terrible c
\f3 rue
\f1 l one that the maesters said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion\'92s earliest memories were of spring. \
\'93When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer has l
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 sted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that.\'94 \
\'93When I was a boy,\'94 Tyrion replied, \'93my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we\'92ve been better
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand.\'94 He grinned. \
The Lord Commander did not seem amused. \'93You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.\'94 Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by the hand. \'93You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming. There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of a
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rochs, and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams.\'94 \
\'93In your dreams,\'94 Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink. \
Mormont was deaf to the edge in hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  voice. \'93The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore.\'94 \
This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. \'93The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.\'94 \
\'93Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before. They are running, my lord . . . but running from what?\'94 Lord Mormont moved to the window and star
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d out into the night. \'93These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter is coming, and when the Long Night falls, only the Night\'92s \
Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north. The gods help us all if we are not ready.\'94 \
\'93The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to ride at first light.\'94 Tyrion got to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f doom. \'93I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.\'94 \
\'93Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I need.\'94 He whistled, and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om his pocket, and that was how Tyrion left him. \
It was bitter cold outside. Bundled th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ckly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander\'92s Keep. He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King\'92s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  boots broke the night\'92s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a banner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire. \
Behind the King\'92s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious. Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and haste. \
Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end of the world. It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not ima
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King\'92s Tower was before him, with its promise of warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking pa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t it, toward the vast pale palisade of the Wall. \
A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion\'92s legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls. \
He had to wait what seemed a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  eternity, stan
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend. \
He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell \
away beneath him, the cage swung, and T
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the Lord Commander\'92s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed. \
Then he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken sto
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole\'92s Town, the little village half a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Finally a thick voice behind him said, \'93Seven hells, it\'92s the dwarf,\'94 and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking. \
\'93Bring him in, damn it.\'94 There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces we
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  leather, black on black. \'93And what will you be wanting, this time of night?\'94 the one by the winch asked. \
\'93A last look.\'94 \
The men exchanged sour glances. \'93Loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  all you want,\'94 the other one said. \'93Just have a care you don\'92t fall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.\'94 A small wooden shack stood under the great crane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone. \
It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. The brothers sprea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  crushed stone across the walkways
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more sto
\f3 ne.
\f1  \
Still, it was n
\f3 othi
\f1 ng that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the W
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk \
that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the gravel looked freshest. \
His bar
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complain
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d more loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white rib
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 on foll
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t lay there like a broken toy, half
\f2\fs24 -
\f1\fs28  embedded in the ice. \
On the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. \'93Who go
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s there? Halt!\'94 \
Tyrion stopped. \'93If I halt too long I\'92ll freeze in place, Jon,\'94 he said as a shaggy pale 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hape slid toward him silently and sni
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 fed at his furs. \'93Hello, Ghost.\'94 \
Jon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and le
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ther, the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face. \'93Lannister,\'94 he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. \'93This is the last place I would have expected to see you.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he was, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 chest was a gleaming black warhorn, banded with silver. \
\'93This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,\'94 Tyrion admitted. \'93I was captured by
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a whim. If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?\'94 \
\'93Not with me here,\'94 Jon promised. \
Tyrion scratched the white wolf behin
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came up as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the gloomy feeling he\'92d be looking up at him. \'93What are you doing up here tonight?\'94 he asked. \'93Besides freezi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g your manhood off . . . \'94 \
\'93I have drawn night guard,\'94 Jon said. \'93Again. Ser Alliser has kindl
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  arranged for the watch commander to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I\'92ll fall asleep during morning drill. So far I have disappointed him.\'94 \
Tyrion grinned. \'93And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 said Jon, smiling, \'93
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 so often as he did.\'94 \
\'93Pyp?\'94 \
\'93Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me working with Grenn and asked for help. Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.\'94 He turned to look north. \'93I have a mile of Wall to gua
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d. Will you walk with me?\'94 \
\'93If you walk slowly,\'94 Tyrion said. \
\'93The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how fast.\'94 \
They walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. \'93I leave on the morrow,\'94 Tyrion sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d. \
\'93I know.\'94 Jon sounded strangely sad. \
\'93I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you would like me to deliver . . . \'94 \
\'93Tell Robb that I\'92m going to command the Night\'92s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.\'94 \
\'93Your brother is bigger than me,\'94 Tyrion said with a laugh. \'93I decline to deliver any message that might get me killed.\'94 \
\'93Rickon will ask when I\'92m coming home. Try to explain where I\'92ve gone, if you can. Tell him he can have all my things while I\'92m away, he\'92ll like that.\'94 \
People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 thought. \'93You could put all this in a letter, you know.\'94 \
\'93Rickon can\'92t read yet. Bran . . . \'94 He stopped suddenly. \'93I don\'92t know what message to send to Bran. Help him, Tyrion.\'94 \
\'93What help could I give him?
\f3  I am
\f1  no maester, to ease his pain. I have no spells to give him back his legs.\'94 \
\'93You gave me help when I needed it,\'94 Jon Snow said. \'93I gave you nothing,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Words.\'94 \
\'93Then give your words to Bran too.\'94 \
\'93You\'92re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Tyrion said. \'93However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran whatever small help is in my power.\'94 \
\'93Thank you, my lord of Lannister.\'94 He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand. \'93Friend.\'94 \
Tyrion found himself o
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 dly touched. \'93Most of my kin are bastards,\'94 he said with a wry smile, \'93but you\'92re the first I\'92ve had to friend.\'94 He pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped Snow by the han
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , flesh against flesh. The boy\'92s grip was firm and strong. \
When he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ruptly and walked to the low, 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 cy northern parapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. Tyrion followed him, and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world. \
The Night\'92s Watch permitted the forest to come no clos
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r than half a mile of the north face of the Wall. The t
\f3 hickets of ironwood and se
\f1 ntinel and oa
\f2\fs24 k
\f1 \cf3  that had\cf2  o\cf3 nce grown there ha\cf2 d \cf3 been 
\f2 \cf2 h
\f1 \cf3 arvested \cf2 ce\cf3 nturies ago, to cr\cf2 ea\cf3 te a 
\f2 \cf2 b
\f0\b\fs38 road 
\f2\b0\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 wath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades, that there were places where grey-green sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers. \
It was neve
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that black wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 they seemed to brood and knew not men. It was small wonder the Night\'92s Watch named it the haunted forest. \
As he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannis
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the Others, the enemy in the night. His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll. \
\'93My uncle is out there,\'94 Jon Snow said softly, leaning on his s
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ear as he stared off into the darkness. \'93The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride \
back tonight, and I\'92ll 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ee him first and blow the horn. He never came,
\f3  though
\f1 . Not that night and not any night.\'94 \
\'93Give him time,\'94 Tyrion said. \
Far off to the north, a wolf began to howl. Another voice picked up the call, then another. Ghost cocked his hea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and listened. \'93If he doesn\'92t come back,\'94 Jon Snow promised, \'93Ghost and I will go find him.\'94 He put his hand on the direwolf\'92s head. \
\'93I believe you,\'94 Tyrion said, but wha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  he t
\f3 hought
\f1  was, And who will go find you? 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e shivered. \

ARYA \
Her father had been fighting with the council again. Arya could see it on hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  face when he came to table, late again, as he had been so often. The first course, a thi
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k sweet soup made with pumpkins, had already been taken away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t to set it apart from the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted cei
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ing and bench space for two hundred a
\f3 t its tre
\f1 stle tables. \
\'93My lord,\'94 Jory
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said when Father entered. He rose to 
\f3 his fe
\f1 et, and the rest of the guard rose with him. Each man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 heir wearers as men of the Hand\'92s household guard. There were only fifty of them, so most of the benches were empty. \
\'93Be seated,\'94 Eddard Stark said. \'93I see you have started wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hout me. I am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city.\'94 He signaled for the meal to resume. The servants began bringing out platters of ribs, roast
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d in a crust of garlic and herbs. \
\'93The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,\'94 Jory said as he resumed his seat. \'93They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King.\'94 \
Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that. \'93Do they also say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Sansa\'92s eyes had grown wide as the plates. \'93A tourney,\'94 she breathed. She was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. \'93Will we be permitted to go, Father?\'94 \
\'93You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert\'92s games and pretend to be honored for his sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.\'94 \
\'93Oh, please,\'94 Sansa said. \'93I want to see.\'94 \
Septa Mordane spoke up. \'93Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa. All the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, \
and as the tourney is in your h
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nor, it would look queer if your family did not attend.\'94 \
Father looked pained. \'93I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa.\'94 He saw Arya. \'93For both of you.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t care about their stupid tourney,\'94 Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey. \
Sansa lifted her head. \'93It will be a splendid event. You shan\'92t be wanted.\'94 \
Anger flashed across Father\'92s face. \'93Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that underst
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 od?\'94 \
Sansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate. She could feel tears stinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, determined not to cry. \
The only sound was the clat
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er of knives and forks. \'93Pray excuse me,\'94 her father announced to the table. \'93I find I have small appetite tonight.\'94 He walked from the hall. \
After he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at a joke, and Hullen started in about horseflesh. \'93Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all.\'94 The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, and Hullen\'92s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine. \
No one talked to Arya. She didn\'92t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her me
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ls alone in her bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when Father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and Sansa. That was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her \'93little sister\'94 and finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa wouldn\'92t even talk to her unless Father made her. \
Back at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her father used to say th
\f3 at a lor
\f1 d needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. \'93Know the men who follow you,\'94 she heard him tell Robb once, \'93and let them know y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u. Don\'92t as
\f3 k your
\f1  men to die for a stranger.\'94 At Winterfell, he always had an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join him. One night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 servants. The next time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im go on about armor and swords and \
how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 e Hullen with his endless horse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old N
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n with her stories. \
Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father\'92s table and listen to them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 reeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played mons
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ers-and-maidens and hide-the- treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used to call her \'93Ar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 a Underfoot,\'94 because he said that was where she always was. She\'92d liked that a lot better than \'93Arya Horseface.\'94 \
Only that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. This was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King\'92s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their voices no
\f3 w, the w
\f1 ay they laughed, the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 stories they told. They\'92d been her friends, she\'92d felt safe a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ound them, but now she knew that was a lie. They\'92d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he\'92d cut him up i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  so many pieces that they\'92d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  
\f3 had
\f1  thought it was a pig they\'92d slaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  who always talked so bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her father. \
\'93He was my friend,\'94 Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could hear. Her ribs sat there untouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at them and felt ill. She pu
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hed away
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 from the table. \
\'93Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?\'94 Septa Mordane asked. \
\'93I\'92m not hungry.\'94 Arya found it an effort to remember her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 courtesies. \'93May I be excused, please?\'94 she recited sti
\f3 ffly. \
\'93You may not,\'94 the septa said. \'93You have scarce
\f1 ly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 touched your food. You will sit down and clean your plate.\'94 \
\'93You clean it!\'94 Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 f
\f3 or the door as the men laug
\f1 hed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her, her voice rising hi
\f3 gher and higher. \
Fat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to th
\f1 e Tower of the Hand.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa\'92s s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 outs. \'93Here now, little one, hold on,\'94 he started to say, reaching, but Arya slid between his legs and then she was \
running up the winding tower steps, her feet hammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her. \
Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King\'92s Landing, and the thing she liked best about it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody! She slammed it now. \
When the 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry. \
She went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and herself most of all. It was all her faul
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , everything bad that had happened. Sansa said so, and Jeyne too. \
Fat Tom was knocking on her door. \'93Arya girl, what\'92s wrong?\'94 he called out. \'93You in there?\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him going
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 away. Fat Tom was always easy to fool. \
Arya went to the chest at the f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling her clothes out with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she\'92d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 lender blade from its sheath. \
Needle. \
She tho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ght of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, her fault. If she had never asked him to play at swords with her . . . \
There was a pounding at her door, louder than before. \'93Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you hear me?\'94 \
Arya spun around, with Needle in he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  hand. \'93You better not come in here!\'94 she warned. She slashed at the air savagely. \
\'93The 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 and will hear of this!\'94 Septa Mordane raged.\
\'93I don\'92t care,\'94 Arya screamed. \'93Go away.\'94\
\'93You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that.\'94 Arya listened at \
the door until she heard the sound of the septa\'92s receding foot
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 teps. \
Sh
\f3 e went 
\f1 back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the courtyard below. If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould go out the window and down the tower, run away from this horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal some 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ood from 
\f3 the k
\f1 itchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they\'92d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall. She found 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 erself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn\'92t feel so alone. \
A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape. \'93Arya,\'94 her father\'92s voice called out. \'93Open the door. We need to talk.\'94 \
Arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed more sad than angry. That made Arya feel even worse. \'93May I come in?\'94 Arya nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father closed the door. \'93Whose sword is that?\'94 \
\'93Mine.\'94 A
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand. \'93Give it to me.\'94 \
Reluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wonderi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g if she would ever hold it again. Her father turned it in the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested the point with his thumb. \'93A bravo\'92s blade,\'94 he said. \'93Yet it seems to me that I know this maker\'92s mark. This is Mikken\'92s work.\'94 \
Arya could not lie to him. She lowered her eyes.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Lord Eddard Stark sighed. \'93My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know nothing 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f it. The Hand of the King is expected t
\f3 o r
\f1 ule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 eems I cannot even rule my own household. How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?\'94 \
Arya chewed her lip and said nothing. She would not betray Jon, not even to their father. \
After a whi
\f3 le, Fa
\f1 ther said, \'93I don\'92t suppose it matters, truly.\'94 He lo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ked down gravely at the sword in his hands. \'93This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl. What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords?\'94 \
\'93I wasn\'92t playing,\'94 Arya insisted. \'93I hate Septa Mordane.\'94\
\'93That\'92s enough.\'94 Her father\'92s voice was curt and hard. \'93The septa is doi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g no more than \
is her duty, though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman. Your mother and I have charged her with the
\f3  imp
\f1 ossible task of making you a lady.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want
\f3  to 
\f1 be a lady!\'94 Arya flared.\
\'93I ought to snap this toy 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 cross my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.\'94 \'93Needle wouldn\'92t break,\'94 Arya said defiantly, but her voice betrayed her words. \
\'93It has a name, does it?\'94 Her father sighed. \'93Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. \'91The wolf blood,\'92 my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brothe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Brandon more than a touch. It brought them both
\f3  to a
\f1 n early grave.\'94 Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his father, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. \'93Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.\'94 \
\'93Lyanna was beautiful,\'94 Arya said, startled. Everybody said so. It was not a thing that was ever said of Arya. \
\'93She was,\'94 Eddard Stark agreed, \'93beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time.\'94 He lifted the sword, held it out between them. \'93Arya, what did you think to do with\
this . . . Needle? Who did you hope to skewer? Your sister? Septa Mordane? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?\'94 \
All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her. \'93Stick them with the pointy end,\'94 she blurted out. \
Her father snorted back 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 aughter. \'93That is the essence of it, I suppose.\'94 \
Arya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see. \'93I was trying to learn, but . . . \'94 Her eyes filled with tears. \'93I aske
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  
\f3 Mycah to practic
\f1 e with me.\'94 The gri
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 f came on her all at once. She turned away, shaking. \'93I asked him,\'94 she cried. \'93It was my fault, it was me . . . \'94 \
Suddenly her father\'92s arms were around her. He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest. \'93No, sweet one,\'94 he murm
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 red. \'93Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself. You did not kill the butcher\'92s boy. That murder 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ies at the Hound\'92s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.\'94 \
\'93I hate them,\'94 Arya confided, red-faced, sniffling. \'93The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince Joffrey. I hate all of them. Joffrey lied, it wasn\'92t the way he said. I hate Sansa too. She did remember, she just lied so Joffrey would like her.\'94 \
\'93We all lie,\'94 her father said. \'93Or did you truly think I\'92d believe that Nymeria ran off?\'94 Arya blushed guiltily. \'93Jory promised not to tell.\'94 \
\'93Jory kept his word,\'94 her father said with a smile. \'93There are some things I do not need to be told. Even a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.\'94 \
\'93We had to throw rocks,\'94 she said miserably. \'93
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  told her to run, to go be free, that I didn\'92t want her anymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she\'92d have deer to hunt. Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks. I hit her twice. She whined and looked at me and I felt so \'92shamed, but it was right, wasn\'92t it? The queen would have killed her.\'94 \
\'93It was right,\'94 her father said. \'93And even the 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ie was . . . not without honor.\'94 He\'92d put Needle aside when he went to Arya to embrace her. Now he took the blade up again and walked
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to the window, where he stood for a moment, loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing out across the courtyard. When he turned back, his eyes were thoughtful. He seated himself on the window seat, Needle across his lap. \'93Arya, sit down. I need to try and explain some things to you.\'94 \
She perched anxiously on the 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 dge of her bed. \'93You are too young to b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  burdened with all my cares,\'94 he told her, \'93but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\'94 \
\'93Winter is coming,\'94 Arya whispered. \
\'93The hard cruel times,\'94 her fathe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  said. \'93We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell. You were born in the long su
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 mer, sweet one, you\'92ve never known anything else, but now the winter is truly coming. Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.\'94 \
\'93The direwolf,\'94 she said, think
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against her chest, suddenly afraid. \
\'93Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa . . . Sansa is your sister. You may be as differen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  as the sun and the moon, b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as she needs you . . . and I need both of you, gods help me.\'94 \
He sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. \'93I don\'92
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  hate Sansa,\'94 she told him. \'93Not truly.\'94 It was only half a lie. \
\'93I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have come to a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean us ill. We can
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the disobedience . . . at home, these were only the summer games of a child. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 ere and now, with winter soon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 upon us, that is a different matter. It is time to begin growing up.\'94 \
\'93I will,\'94 Arya vowed. She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant. \'93I c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n be strong too. I can be as strong as Robb.\'94 \
He held Needle out to her, hilt first. \'93Here.\'94 \
She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes. For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then her father said, \'93Go on, it\'92s yours,\'94 and she took it in her hand. \
\'93I can keep it?\'94 she said. \'93For true?\'94 \
\'93For true.\'94 He smiled. \'93If I took it away, no doubt I\'92d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight. Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.\'94 \
\'93I won\'92t
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  I promise.\'94 Arya clutched Needl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  tightly to her chest as her father took his leave. \
The next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon. The septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father no
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ded. \
Three days later, at midday, her father\'92s steward Vayon Poole sent Ar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 a to the Small Hall. The trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls. The hall seemed empty, until an unfamiliar voice said, \'93You are late, boy.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  A
\f3  sligh
\f1 t man with a bald head and a great b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ak of a nose stepped out of the shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords. \'93Tomorrow you will be here at midday.\'94 He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Braavos perhaps, or Myr. \
\'93Who are you?\'94 Arya asked. \
\'93I am your dancing master.\'94 He tossed her one of the wooden blades. She grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the floor. \'93Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up.\'94 \
It was 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel. Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of her.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 It was heavier than it looked, much 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1 \cf3 eavier th\cf2 an\cf3  Needle. \
The bal\cf2 d \cf3 man c
\f2 \cf2 l
\f1 \cf3 icked his\cf2  t\cf3 eeth together. \'93Th\cf2 at\cf3  is n
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38 t the way
\f2\b0\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  boy. This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it. You will take the blade in one hand.\'94 \
\'93It\'92s too heavy,\'94 Arya said. \
\'93It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing. A hollow insid
\f3 e is
\f1  filled with lead, just so. One hand now is all that is needing.\'94 \
Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants. She held the sword in her left hand. He seemed to approve. \'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  left is good. All is reversed, it will make your enemies more awkward. Now you are standing wrong. Turn your body sideface, yes, so. You are skinny as the shaft of a spear, do you know. That is good too, the target is sm
\f3 aller.
\f1  Now the grip. Let me see.\'94 He moved closer and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging them. \'93Just so, yes. Do not squeeze it so tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.\'94 \
\'93What if I drop it?\'94 Arya said. \
\'93The steel must be part of your arm,\'94 the bald man told her. \'93Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.\'94 \
It was the third time he had called her \'93boy.\'94 \'93I\'92m a gi
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 l,\'94 Arya objected. \
\'93Boy, girl,\'94 Syrio Forel said. \'93You are a sword, that is all.\'94 He clicked his teeth together. \'93Just so, that is the grip. You are not ho
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ding a battle-
\f3 axe, you
\f1  are holding a\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97needle,\'94 Ar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 a finished for him, fiercely. \
\'93Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are learning, the knight\'92s dance, hacking and hammering, no. This is the bravo\'92s dance, the
\f3  wate
\f1 r dance, swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? When you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die.\'94 He took a step backward, raised his own wooden blade. \'93Now you will try to strike me.\'94 \
Arya tried to strike him. She tried for four hours, until every muscle in her body was sore and aching, while Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do. \
The next day their real work began. \

DAENERYS \
The Dothraki sea,\'94 Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the top of the ridge. beneath them, the plain stretched out immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond. It was a sea, Dany thoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t. Past here, there were no hills, no mountains, no trees nor cities nor roads, only the endless grasses, the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93It\'92s so green,\'94 she said. \
\'93Here and now,\'94 Ser Jorah agreed. \'93You ought to see it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 when it blooms, all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old bronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo, b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ue grasses and orange grasses
\f3  and gra
\f1 sses like rainbows. Down in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire wo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ld, and then all life will end.\'94 \

\f3 That thou
\f1 ght gave Dany the shivers. \'93I don\'92t want to talk about that now,\'94 she said. \'93It\'92s so beautiful here, I don\'92t want to think about everything dying.\'94 \
\'93As you will, Khaleesi,\'94 Ser Jorah said respectfully. \
She heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her. She and Mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them. Her handmaid Irri and the young archers
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle. Her brother was miserable out here. He ought never have come. Magister Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He would stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. \'93And if he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon,\'94 Viserys had vowed, laying a hand on his borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune. \
Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother\'92s complaints right now. The day was too perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting \
hawk circled. The grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  She would not let Viserys spoil it. \
\'93Wait here,\'94 Dany told Ser Jorah. \'93Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command it.\'94 \
The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a hands
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 me man. He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort. \'93You are l
\f3 earn
\f1 ing to talk like a queen, Daenerys.\'94 \
\'93Not a queen,\'94 said Da
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 y. \'93A khaleesi.\'94 She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone. \
The descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one. \
At first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous a
\f3 nd blood
\f1 y. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands bliste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her moun
\f3 t. \
Even the nig
\f1 hts brought no 
\f3 relief. Khal Drogo ignored 
\f1 her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 fter
\f3 ward 
\f1 to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and be
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 in to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep. \
Day followed day
\f3 , and nig
\f1 ht followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . \
Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it this time. The
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e was only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and \
when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce. \
And the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. \'93Khaleesi,\'94 Jhiqui said, \'93what is wrong? Are you sick?\'94 \
\'93I was,\'94 she an
\f3 swered, s
\f1 tanding over the dragon\'92s eggs th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t Illyrio had given her when she wed. She touched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she thought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers . . . or was she still dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. \
From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one befor
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters burst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather. \
The khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dan
\f3 y to ride
\f1  in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the filly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. With every passing day, Dany felt surer in her 
\f3 seat.
\f1  The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and it was not their custom to name their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much. \
As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode at the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant. \
They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the town
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 folk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was 
\f3 swift
\f1  and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a
\f3  high blue
\f1  waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down Valyrian roads a thousand years old and str
\f3 aight as a D
\f1 ot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 raki arrow. For half a moon, they rode through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and le
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 urs with silver fur and huge pur
\f3 ple 
\f1 eyes, but all fled before the \
approach of the khalasar and Dany got no glimpse of them. \
By then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day\'92s riding, yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now, 
\f3 and each mornin
\f1 g 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he came willingly to her sad
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 le, eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still cried out when Drogo took her, it was not 
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 lways
\f1  i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  pain. \
At the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal Drogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent, Drogo\'92s bloodriders and the 
\f3 men 
\f1 of her khas were never far, and her brothe
\f3 r was an
\f1  unwelcome shad
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w, day and night. Dany cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea. \
The green 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 wallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of horseflesh and Dany\'92s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki sme
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ls. They seemed to belong here. Dany breathed it 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that thick black soil. Swinging down from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots. \
Viserys came upon her as sudden
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard. \'93You dare!\'94 he screamed at her. \'93You give com
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ands to me? To me?\'94 He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. \'93Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!\'94 \
Dany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 earing Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail. \
He was still screaming. \'93You do not comman
\f3 d the dr
\f1 agon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord\'92s slut, do you hear me?\'94 His hand went unde
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  
\f3 her
\f1  vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. \'93Do you hear me?\'94 \
Dany shoved him away, hard. \
Viserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage twisted 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that. \
Crack. \
The whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him backward. He went sprawling in the
\f3  grass, 
\f1 stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 self. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not understand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. \'93Jhogo asks if you would have him dead, Khaleesi, \'93 Irri said. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany replied. \'93No.\'94 \
Jhogo understood that. One of the others
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, \'93Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.\'94 \
Her brother
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, 
\f3 crying i
\f1 ncoher
\f3 ently, st
\f1 ruggling for breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe. \
\'93Tell them I 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 o not wish him harmed,\'94 Dany sai
\f3 d. \
Irri
\f1  repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a puppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep. \
\'93I warned him what would happen, my lady,\'94 Ser Jorah Mormont said. \'93I told him to stay on the r
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 dge, as you commanded.\'94 \
\'93I know you did,\'94 Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced and sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that before?
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been. \
\'93Take his horse,\'94 Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was he
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ring; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. \'93Let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar.\'94 Among the Dothraki, the man who does no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  ride was no man at all, the lowest of the low, without honor or pride. \'93Let everyone see him as he is.\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 Viserys screamed. He turned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common Tongu
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  with words the horsemen would not understand. \'93Hit her, Mormont. Hurt her. Your king commands it. Kil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  these Dothraki dogs and teach her.\'94 \
The exile knight looked from Dan
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt between her toes and oil in her hair, he with his silks and steel
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Dany could see the decision on his face. \'93He shall walk, Khaleesi,\'94 he said. He took her brother\'92s horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver. \
Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  but he would not move, and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him anymore, Dany grew afraid. \'93Will he find his way back?\'94 she asked Ser Jorah as they rode. \
\'93Even a man a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,\'94 he replied. \'93He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.\'94 \
Jorah laughed. \'93Where else should he go? If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely find him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.\'94 \
Dany saw the 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ruth of t
\f3 hat.
\f1  The khalasar was like a city on the march, but it did not march blindly. Always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies, while out
\f3 riders g
\f1 uar
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ed their flanks. They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come from. These plains were a part of\
them . . . and of her, now. \
\'93I hit him,\'94 she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed. \'93Ser Jorah, do y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u think . . . he\'92ll be so angry when he gets back . . . She shivered. \'93I woke the dragon, didn\'92t I?\'94 \
Ser Jorah snorted. \'93Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he died on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\'94 \
His blunt
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 words startled her. It seemed as though all the things
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she had always believed were suddenly called into question. \'93You . . . you swore him your sword . . . \'94 \
\'93That I did, girl,\'94 Ser Jorah said. \'93And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his servants?\'94 His voic
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  was bitter. \
\'93He is still the t
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ue king. He is . . . \'94 \
Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \'93Truth now. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\'94 \
Dany thought about that. \'93He would not be a very good king, would he?\'94 \
\'93There have been worse . . . but not many.\'94 The knight gave his heels to his mount and 
\f3 started 
\f1 off again. \
Da
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 y rode close beside him. \'93Still,\'94 she said, \'93the common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the
\f3  narr
\f1 ow sea to free them.\'94 \
\'93The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\'94 Ser Jorah told her. \'93It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long 
\f3 as they 
\f1 ar
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  left in peace.\'94 He gave a shrug. \'93They never are.\'94 \
Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah\'92s words, the more they rang of truth.
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 \
\'93Wh
\f1 at do you pray for, 
\f3 Ser Jorah?\'94 she asked him. \'93Home,\'94 he said. His voice was thick wit
\f1 h longing.\
\'93I pray for home too,\'94 she told him, believing it.\
Ser Jorah laughed. \'93Look around you then, Khaleesi.\'94 \
But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\'92s Landing and the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 reat Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\'92s eye they burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\'92s eye, all the doors were red. \
\'93My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\'94 Dany said
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  She had known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a whisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear. \
Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. \'93You think not.\'94 \
\'93He could not lead an army eve
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  if my lord husband
\f3  gave hi
\f1 m one,\'94 Dany said. \'93He has no coin and the only knight who
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 follows him reviles him as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never take us home.\'94 \
\'93Wise child.\'94 The knight smiled. \
\'93I am no child,\'94 she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount, rousing the silver to a gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 hind, the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face. By the time she reached the khalasar, it was dusk. \
The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every man, woman, and child in the ca
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 p would know him for a walker. There were no secrets in the khalasar. \
Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for groomin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  and entered her tent. It was cool and dim beneath the silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon\'92s eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand droplets of
\f3  scarlet
\f1  flame swam before her eyes. She blinked, and they were gone. \
Stone, she told herself. They 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 re only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons are all dead. She put her palm against
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the black egg, fingers spread gen
\f3 tly acro
\f1 ss the curve of the shell. The stone was warm. Almost hot. \'93The sun,\'94 Dany whispered. \'93The sun warmed them as they rode.\'94 \
She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire outside the tent, while Irri and Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub\'97another bride gift\'97from the packhorses and carried water from the pool. Wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n the bath was steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her. \
\'93Have you ever seen a dragon?\'94 she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqu
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28  sluiced sand from her hair. S
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e had heard that the first dragons had come from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild. \
\'93Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,\'94 Irri said. \'93Dead,\'94 agreed Jhiqui. \'93Long and long ago.\'94 \
Viserys had told her that th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, during the reign of Aegon III, who was called the Dragonbane. That did not seem so long ago to Dany. \'93Everywhere?\'94 she said, disappointed. \'93Even in the east?\'94 Magic had died in the west when the Doo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  fell on Valyria and the Lands of the Long \
Summer, and nei
\f3 ther spe
\f1 ll-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back, but Dany had always heard that the east wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  different. It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn\'92t there be dragons too? \
\'93No dragon,\'94 Irri said. \'93Brave men kill
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.\'94 \'93It is known,\'94 agreed Jhiqui. \
\'93A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,\'94 blond Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 yed their father\'92s khalasar. Doreah was 
\f3 older, a
\f1 lmost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in Lys. \
Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. \'93The moon?\'94
\f3  \
\'93He t
\f1 old me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,\'94 the Lysene girl said. \'93Once there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why drago
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 s breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.\'94 \
The two D
\f3 othraki 
\f1 girls giggled and laugh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. \'93You are foolish strawhead slave,\'94 Irri said. \'93Moon is
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 no egg. M\cf2 oo\cf3 n is god, woman wi\cf2 fe\cf3  of s
\f2 \cf2 u
\f1 \cf3 n. It is \cf2 kn\cf3 own.\'94 \
\'93It is kno\cf2 wn\cf3 ,\'94 Jh
\f2 \cf2 i
\f0\b\fs38 qui a
\f2\b0\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 reed. \
Dany\'92s skin was flushed and pink when s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e climbed from the tub. Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores. Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon. While Doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver, she thought about the moon, and eggs, and dragons. \
Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down. \'93Doreah, stay and eat with me,\'94 Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away. The Lysene girl had hair the color of honey, and eyes like the summer sky. \
She lowered those eyes when they were alone. \'93You honor me, Khaleesi,\'94 she said, but it was no honor, only service. Long aft
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r the moon had risen, they sat together, talking. \
That night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for him. He stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 let them fall to the ground. \'93This night we must go outside, my lord,\'94 she told him, for the Dothraki believe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  that all things of importance in a man\'92s life must be done beneath the open sky. \
Khal Drogo followed her out into the 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 oonlight, the bells in his hair tinkling softly. A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass, and it was there that Dany drew him down. When he tried to turn her over, she put a hand on his chest. \'93No,\'94 she said. \'93This night I would look on your face.\'94 \
There is no privacy in the heart of the k
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 alasar. Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him, heard the soft voices as she did the thi
\f3 ngs
\f1  that Doreah had told her to do. It was not
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ing to her. Was she not khaleesi? His were the only eyes that mattered, and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver, and when the moment of his pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out her name. \
They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany\'92s stomach with her fingers and said, \'93Khaleesi, you are with child.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 Dany told her.\
It was her fourteenth name day. \

BRAN \
In the yard belo
\f3 w, Rickon ran w
\f1 ith the wolves. \
Bran watched from his window seat. Wherever the boy went, Grey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut him off, until Rickon saw him, screamed in delight, and went pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened until he was all black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran\'92s Summer came last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see. Smaller than Grey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter. He could 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ear his brother\'92s breathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hard-packed earth on little baby legs. \
His eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at the thought, Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall. His eighth name day had come and gone. He was almost a man grown now, too old to cry. \
\'93It was just a lie,\'94 he said bitter
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y, remembering the crow from his dream. \'93I can\'92t fly. I can\'92t even run.\'94 \
\'93Crows are all liars,\'94 Old Nan agreed, from the ch
\f3 air where she sat
\f1  doing her needlework. \'93I know a story ab
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut a crow.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want any more stories,\'94 Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and her stories once. Before. But it was different now. They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse. \'93I hate your stupid stories.\'94 \
The old woman smiled at him toothlessly. \'93My stories? No, my little lord, not mine. The stories are, before me and after me, before you too.\'94 \
She was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak to climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew how old she was, but his father said she\'92d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the oldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an older brother of \
Lord Rickard, Bran\'92s grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord Rickard\'92s father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children. She had lost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and her grandson was killed on the walls of Pyke during Balon Greyjoy\'92s rebellion. Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died. All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, but Old Nan just lived on and on, doing her needlework and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 elling her stories. \
\'93I don\'92t care whose stories they are,\'94 Bran told her, \'93I hate them.\'94 He didn\'92t wa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t stories and he didn\'92t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside him. He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers. He wanted it to be t
\f3 he w
\f1 ay it had been before. \
\'93I know a story about a boy who hated stories,\'94 Old Nan said with her stupid little smile, her needles moving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at her. \
It would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King\'92s Landing, but they\'92d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message, and another to Mothe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been no answe
\f3 rs. 
\f1 \'93Ofttimes the birds are lost, child,\'94 the maester had told him. \'93There\'92s many a mile and many a hawk between here and King\'92s Landing, the message may not have reached them.\'94 Yet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept . . . or perhaps Bran had died, and they had forgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and 
\f2\fs24 F
\f1\fs28 at Tom and a quarter of the guard. \
Only Robb
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was Robb the Lord now, or trying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his window. At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books. Sometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, visiting distant holdfasts. Whenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would c
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming back. Even 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hen he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen and Theon Gre
\f3 yjoy than he ever
\f1  did for his brothers. \
\'93I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder,\'94 Old Nan said. \'93That was always your favorite.\'94 \
Thousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell, and some said the Wall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had liked that story. Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon, the baby she had nursed all those years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was killed by the Mad King before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad told him once, t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at all the Brandon Starks had become one person in her head. \
\'93That\'92s not my favorite,\'94 he said. \'93My favorites were the scary ones.\'94 He heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window. Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the wolves following him, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing. \
\'93Oh, my sweet summer child,\'94 Old Nan said quietly, \'93what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.\'94 \
\'93You mean the Others,\'94 Bran said querulously. \
\'93The Others,\'94 Old Nan agreed. \'93Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a nig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t that lasted a generat
\f3 ion,
\f1  and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.\'94 Her voice and h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, \'93So, child. This is t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e sort of story you like?\'94 \
\'93Well,\'94 Bran said re
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 uctantly, \'93yes, only . . . \'94 \
Old Nan nodded. \'93In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,\'94 she said as her needles went click click click. \'93They were cold things, d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ad things, that hated iron and fire and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, rid
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.\'94 \
Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d Bran found himself leaning \
forward to listen. \
\'93Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds \'97\'94 \
The door opened with a bang, and Bran\'92s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him. \'93Hodor!
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  the stableboy announced, as was his custom, smiling hugely at them all. \
Maester Luwin was not smiling. \'93We have visitors,\'94 he announced, \'93and your presence is required, Bran.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m listening to a story now,\'94 Bran complained. \
\'93Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem, why, there they are,\'94 Old Nan said. \'93Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tories of their own.\'94 \
\'93Who is it?\'94 Bran asked Maester Luwin. \
\'93Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night\'92s Watch, with word from your brothe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Jon. Robb is meeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?\'94 \
\'93Hodor!\'94 Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door. Hodor was nearly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 s
\f3 eve
\f1 n feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great
\f2\fs24 -
\f1\fs28 grandmother when he was ol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . It did not seem likely, even if Hodor lived to be a thousand. \
Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if he wer
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  a bale of hay, and cradled him against his massive chest. He always smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair. \'93Hodor,\'94 he said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 uch, but no one could doubt that he \
knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told her that, and confessed that Hodor\'92s real name was Walder. No one knew 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 here \'93Hodor\'94 had come from, she said, but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 t was the only word he had. \
They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the stableboy\'92s long strides.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
R
\f3 obb w
\f1 as seated in Father\'92s high seat, wearing ring
\f3 mail 
\f1 and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb the Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 behind him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beneath tall narrow windows. In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four strangers in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  black of the Night\'92s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the momen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  that Hodor carried him through the doors. \
\'93Any man of the Night\'92s Watch is welcome here at Winterfe
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l for as long as he wishes to stay,\'94 Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  across his knees, the steel bare for all the world to see. Even Bran knew what it meant 
\f3 to g
\f1 reet a guest
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with an unsheathed sword. \
\'93Any man of the Night\'92s Watch,\'94 the dwarf repeated, \'93but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword. \'93I am the lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  here while my mother and father are away, Lannister. I am not your boy.\'94 \
\'93If you are a lord, you might learn a lord\'92s courtesy,\'94 the little man replied, ignoring the sword point in his face. \'93Your bastard brother has all your father\'92s graces, it would seem.\'94 \
\'93Jon,\'94 Bran gasped out from Hodor\'92s arms.\
The dwarf turned to look at him. \'93So it is t
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ue, the boy lives. I could scarce believe it. You \
Starks are hard to kill.\'94 \
\'93You Lannisters had best remember that,\'94 Robb said, lowering his sword. \'93Hodor, bring my brother here.\'94 \
\'93Hodor,\'94 Hodor said, and 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, wher
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North. The seat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; \
the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 legs dangling. The great seat made him feel half a baby. \
Robb put a hand on his shoulder. \'93You said you had bu
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 iness with Bran. Well, here he is, Lannister.\'94 \
Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister\'92s eyes. One was black and one was green, and both were looking at him, studyin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  him, weighing him. \'93I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,\'94 the little man said at last. \'93Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?\'94 \
\'93I never,\'94 Bran insisted. He never fell, never never never.\
\'93The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,\'94 said \
Maester Luwin gently. \'93Curious,\'94 said Tyrion Lannister. \
\'93My brother is not here to an
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 wer questions, Lannister,\'94 Robb said curtly. \'93Do your business and be on 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 our way.\'94 \
\'93I have a gift for you,\'94 the dwarf said to Bran. \'93Do you like to ride, boy?\'94 \
Maester Luwin came forward. \'93My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. He cannot sit a horse.\'94 \
\'93Nonsense,\'94 said Lannister. \'93With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.\'94 \
The word was a knife through Bran\'92s heart. He f
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 l
\f3 t t
\f1 ears come unbidden to his eyes. \'93I\'92m not a cripple!\'94 \
\'93Then I am not a dwarf,\'94 the dwa
\f3 rf s
\f1 aid with a twist o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  his mouth. \'93My father will rejoice to hear it.\'94 Greyjoy laughed. \
\'93What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?\'94 Maester Luwin asked. \
\'93A smart horse,\'94 L
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nnister replied. \'93The boy cannot use his legs to command the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the voice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o be unlearned.\'94 He drew a rolled paper from his belt. \'93Give this to your saddler. He will provide the rest.\'94 \
Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey squirrel. He unrolled it, studied it. \'93I see. You 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 raw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought to work. I should have thought of this myself.\'94 \
\'93It came eas
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 er to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.\'94 \
\'93Will I truly be able to ride?\'94 Bran asked. He wanted 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o believe them, but he was afraid. Perhaps it was just another lie. The crow had promised him that h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  could fly. \
\'93You will,\'94 the dwarf told him. \'93And I swear to you, boy, on horseba
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k you will be as tall as any of them.\'94 \
Robb Stark seemed puzzled. \'93Is this some trap, Lannister? What\'92s Bran to you? Why should you want to help him?\'94 \
\'93Your brother Jon asked it of me.
\f3  And 
\f1 I have a tender spot
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things.\'94 Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. \
The door to the yard flew open. Sunlight came streaming a
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ross the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless. The direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their eyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind pic
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed it up. They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left. \
\'93The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,\'94 Theon Greyioy commented. \
\'93Perhaps it\'92s time I took my leave,\'94 Tyrion said. He took a step backward . . . and Shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him, snarling. Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at him from the other side. He reeled away, unsteady on his feet, and Grey Wind snapped at his arm, teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth. \
\'93No!\'94 Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 men reached for their steel. \'93Summer, here. Summer, to me!\'94 \
The direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister. He crept backward, away from the little man, and settled down below Bran\'92s dangling feet. \
Robb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, \'93Grey Wind.\'94 His direwolf moved to him, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggyd
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 g, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like green fire. \
\'93Rickon, call him,\'94 Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed, \'93Home, Shaggy, home now.\'94 The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon, who hugged him tightly around the neck. \
Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, \'93How interesting.\'94 \
\'93Are you well, my lord?\'94 asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke. \
\'93My sleeve is torn and my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.\'94 \
Even Robb looked shaken. \'93The wolves . . . I don\'92t know why they did that . . . \'94 \
\'93No doubt they mistook me for dinner.\'94 Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. \'93I thank you for calling them off, young ser. I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible. And now I will be leaving, truly.\'94 \
\'93A moment, my lord,\'94 Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they huddled close together, whisperin
\f3 g. Bran tried to
\f1  hear what they were saying, but their voices were too low. \
Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword. \'93I . . . I may have been hasty with you,\'94 he said. \'93You\'92ve done Bran a kindness, and, well . . . \'94 Robb composed himself with an effort. \'93The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it, Lannister.\'94 \
\'93Spare me your false courtesies, boy. You do not love me and you do not want me here. I saw an inn outside your walls, in the winter town. I\'92ll find a bed there, and both of us will sleep easier. For a few coppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.\'94 He spoke to one of the black brothers, an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard. \'93Yoren, we go south at daybreak. You will find me on the road, no doubt.\'94 With that he made his exit, struggling across the hall on his short legs, past Rickon and out the door. His men followed. \
The four of the Night\'92s Watch 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 emained. Robb turned to them uncertainly. \'93I have had rooms prepared, and you\'92ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road. I hope you will honor us at table tonight.\'94 He spoke the words so awkwardly that e
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 en Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, not words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same. \
Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed. Old Nan was asleep in her chair. Hodor said \'93Hodor,\'94 gathered up his great-grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly, while Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that he could feast with the Night\'92s Watch in the Great Hall. \'93Summer,\'94 he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek. \'93I can ride now,\'94 he whispered to his friend. \'93We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.\'94 After a time he slept. \
In his dream he w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, through the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look down, his head swam dizzily and he felt his f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ngers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart had stop
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ed pounding, until he coul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but up. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms were sore
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles watched him ascend. Their eyes 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 lowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps on
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear. He 
\f3 must not listen, he t
\f1 old himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he was sa
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 e. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  safe after all. \'93I didn\'92t hear,\'94 he wept as they came closer and closer, \'93I didn\'92t, I didn\'92t.\'94 \
He woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. \'93I di
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 n\'92t hear,\'94 he whispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said \'93Hodor,\'94 and lit the candle by the bedside, and Bra
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  sighed with relief. \
Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands. When it was time, he carried him down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire. The lord\'92s seat at the head of the table had been le
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 t empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with Bran across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips soaking in butter, and afterward the cook had promised
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 honeycombs. Summer snatched table scraps from Bran\'92s hand, while Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner. Winterfell\'92s dogs would not come ne
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r the hall now. Bran had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it. \
Yo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 en was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester Luwin. The old man had a sour smell, as if he had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the rib
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  to suck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. \'93Ser Alliser\'92s bane,\'94 he \
grunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen, the 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 lack brothers grew ominously quiet. \
\'93What i
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  it?\'94 Bran asked. \
Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest. \'93There\'92s hard news, m\'92lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer. Stark\'92s gone.\'94 \
One of the other men said, \'93The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and he\'92s late returning, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Too long,\'94 Yoren said. \'93Most like he\'92s dead.\'94 \
\'93My uncle is not dead,\'94 Robb Stark said loudly, anger in his tones. He rose fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword. \'93Do you hear me? My uncle is not dead!\'94 His voice rang against the stone walls, and Bran was suddenly afraid. \
Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 at Robb, \cf2 un\cf3 impressed. \'93Whatev\cf2 er\cf3  you 
\f2 \cf2 s
\f1 \cf3 ay, m\'92lor\cf2 d,\cf3 \'94 he said. He suck\cf2 ed\cf3  at a
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 piece o
\f2\b0\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  meat between his teeth. \
The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \'93There\'92s not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark. He\'92ll find his way back.\'94 \
\'93Well,\'94 said Yoren, \'93maybe he will and maybe he won\'92t. Good men have gone into those woods before, and never come out.\'94 \
All Bran could think of was Old Nan\'92s story of the Others and the last hero, hounded through the white woo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s by dead men and spiders big as hounds. He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how that story ended. \'93The children will help him,\'94 he blurted, \'93the children of the forest!\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, \'93Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are the faces in the trees.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Down here, might be that\'92s true, Maester,\'94 Yoren said, \'93but up past the Wall, who\'92s to say? Up there, a man can\'92t always tell what\'92s alive and what\'92s dead.\'94 \
That night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  bed himself. Grey \
Wind led the way, and Summer came close behind. His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top. \
He put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the candle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know what to say. \'93We\'92ll find a horse for you, I promise,\'94 Robb whispered at last. \
\'93Are they ever coming back?\'94 Bran asked him. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just Robb the Lord. \'93Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. Wouldn\'92t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?\'94 Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother\'92s smile. \'93And afterward, we\'92ll ride north to see the Wall. We won\'92t even t
\f3 ell Jon
\f1  we\'92re coming, we\'92ll just be there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.\'94 \
\'93An adventure,\'94 Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb\'92s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together. \

EDDARD \
Lord Arryn\'92s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle said. \'93I would be more than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for refreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees with m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.\'94 \
There was no denying th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. \'93That would be most kind,\'94 Ned said, seating himself. \
Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar. \'93Iced milk for the King\'92s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well sweetened.\'94 \
As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach. \'93The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottes
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that wa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 , does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.\'94 The heavy jeweled chain around the old man\'92s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. \'93To be sure, King Maekar\'92s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted. Oldtown steamed and sweltere
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  by day and came alive only by night. We would walk
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord\'97perfume and sweat, melons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man then, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.\'94 Pycelle\'92s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep. \'93My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you wo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld. Minds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk.\'94
\f3  The se
\f1 rving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. \'93Sweet child.\'94 He lifted a cup, tasted, nodded. \'93Thank you. You may go.\'94 \
When the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. \'93Now where were we? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn . . . \'94 \
\'93I did.\'94 Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his tas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e. \
\'93If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,\'94 Pycelle said. \'93We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had
\f3  borne so faithful
\f1 ly for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I am less certain.\'94 He gave a ponderous shake of his head. \
\'93What can you tell me of his final illness?\'94 \
The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. \'93He came to me o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t something was troubling him deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which can upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.\'94 \
\'93I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.\'94 \
The Grand Maester\'92s nod was as slow and deliberate as a g
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 acier. \'93I did, and I fear the 
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 ady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.\'94 \
\'93Did Lord Ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 yn say anything to you during his final hours?\'94 \
Pycelle wrinkled his brow. \'93In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several times, but whether he was asking fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon\'92s spirits. His love was fierce to see.\'94 \
\'93Was there nothing else? No final words?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer. Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. The seed is strong, he said. At the e
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.\'94 \
Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. \'93Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn\'92s death?\'94 \
\'93Unnatural?\'94 The aged maester\'92s voice was thin as 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  whisper. \'93No, I could not say so. Sad, for a certainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.\'94 \
\'93This illness that took him,\'94 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid Ned. \'93Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?\'94 \
\'93Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,\'94 Pycelle replied. \'93Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Ja
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 haerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaerys\'92s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fi
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 th of His Name. I have seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is different, and every case is alike.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Lord Jon\'92s death was no stranger t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 an any other.\'94 \
\'93His wife thought otherwise.\'94 \
The Grand Maester nodded. \'93I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife. If a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the deat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.\'94 \
\'93So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?\'94\
\'93I am,\'94 Pycelle replied gravely. \'93If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?\'94 \'93Poison,\'94 Ned suggested quietly. \
Pycelle\'92s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \'93A disturbing thought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common. Grand Maest
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the pois
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ner is 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 eneath contempt.\'94 He fell silent for a moment, his eyes lost in thought. \
\'93What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely. Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ed none of the signs. A
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the Hand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man\'92s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?\'94 \
\'93I have h
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 ard
\f1  it said that poison is a woman\'92s weap
\f3 on.\'94 \
Pyc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lle stroked his beard thoughtfully. \'93It is said. Women, cravens . . . and eunuchs.\'94 He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. \'93The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your tru
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t in spiders, my lord.\'94 \
That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat made his flesh crawl. \'93I will remember
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 hat,
\f1  Maester. And I thank you for your help. I have taken enough of your time.\'94 He stood. \
Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair s
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 owly and escorted Ned to the door. \'93I hope I have helped in some small way to put your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mind at ease. If there is a
\f3 ny oth
\f1 er service I might perform, you need only ask.\'94 \
\'93One thing,\'94 Ned told him. \'93I should be curious
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he fell ill.\'94 \
\'93I fear you would find it of little interest,\'94 Pycelle said. \'93It was a 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 onderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.\'94 \
\'93Still, I should like to see it.\'94 \
The old man opened the door. \'93As you wish. I have it here somewhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.\'94 \
\'93You have been most courteous,\'94 Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, \'93One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn\'92s bedside when he died. I wonder, was the queen with him?\'94 \
\'93Why, no,\'94 Pycelle said. \'93She and th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company with her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey\'92s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion\'92s crown. In that he was sadly disapp
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 inted. It fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn\'92s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  heavier heart.\'94 \
\'93Dark wings, dark words,\'94 Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as \
a boy. \
\'93So the fishwives say,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, \'93but we know it is not always so. When Maester Luwin\'92s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message li
\f3 fted every true heart in the castle, did it
\f1  not?\'94 \
\'93As you say, Maester.\'94 \
\'93The gods are 
\f3 merciful.\'94 Pycelle bowed his head. \'93Come to me as of
\f1 te
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  as you like, Lord Eddard. I am here to serve.\'94 \
Yes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom? \
On the w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  scuffed her bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at 
\f3 her. 
\f1 \'93Arya, what are you doing?\'94 \
\'93Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself. \
Ned had to smile. \'93Which toe?\'94 he teased. \
\'93Any toe,\'94 Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying dangerously before she regained her 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 alance. \
\'93Must you do your standing here?\'94 he asked. \'93It\'92s a long hard fall down these steps.\'94 \
\'93Syrio says a water danc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r never falls.\'94 She lowered her leg to stand on two feet. \'93Father, will Bran come and live with us now?\'94 \
\'93Not for a long time, sweet one,\'94 he told her. \'93He needs to win his strength back.\'94 Arya bit her lip. \'93What will Bran do when he\'92s of age?\'94 \
Ned knelt beside he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . \'93He has years to find that answer, Arya. For now, it is enough to know that he will live.\'94 The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark had taken the girls 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vine
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ; they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose, Arya several hours later, curling up \
in the grass under Ned\'92s cl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ak. All through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  dark red blooms of dragon\'92s breath surrounded the girls where they lay. \'93I dreamed of Bran,\'94 Sansa had whispered to him. \'93I saw him smiling.\'94 \
\'93He was going to be a k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 i
\f3 ght,\'94 A
\f1 rya was saying now. \'93A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned said. He saw no use in 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ying to her. \'93Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king\'92s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea, or enter your mother\'92s Faith and become the High Septon.\'94 But he will never run beside his wolf again, he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 hough
\f1 t with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his arms. \
Arya cocked her head to one side. \'93Can I be a king\'92s councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?\'94 \
\'93You,\'94 Ned said, kissing her ligh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ly on the brow, \'93will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , yes, perhaps even a High Septon.\'94 \
Arya screwed up her face. \'93No,\'94 she said, \'93that\'92s Sansa.\'94 She fo
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ded up her right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there. \
Inside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  the basin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying his face. \'93My lord,\'94 he said, \'93Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.\'94 \
\'93Escort him to my solar,\'94 Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ightest linen h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  could find. \'93I\'92ll see him at once.\'94 \
Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below. \'93If only old Selmy\'92s mind were as nimble
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as his blade,\'94 he said wistfully, \'93our council meetings
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 would be a good deal livelier.\'94 \
\'93Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King\'92s Landing.\'94 Ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged, white-haired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \
\'93And as tiresome,\'94 Littlefinger added, \'93th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ugh I daresay he should do well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the H
\f3 ound
\f1 , and it was only four years ago that he was champion.\'94 \
The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least. \'93Is there a reason for
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?\'94 \
Littlefinger smiled. \'93I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.\'94 \
That took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, who struck him as too clev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r by half. \'93You h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve something for me?\'94 \
\'93Someone,\'94 Littlefinger corrected. \'93Four someones, if truth be told. Had you thought to question the Hand\'92s servants?\'94 \
Ned frown
\f3 ed
\f1 . \'93Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.\'94 Lysa had done him no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled: Jon\'92s maester, his steward, the captain of his gua
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d, his knights and retainers. \
\'93Most of her household,\'94 Littlefinger said, \'93not all. A few remain. A pregnant
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly\'92s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn\'92s squire.\'94 \
\'93His
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 squire?\'94 \cf2 Ne\cf3 d was pleasantly s\cf2 ur\cf3 prise
\f2 \cf2 d
\f1 \cf3 . A man\'92s\cf2  s\cf3 quire often knew a\cf2  g\cf3 reat 
\f2 \cf2 d
\f0\b\fs38 eal 
\f2\b0\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f his comings and goings. \
\'93Ser Hugh of the Vale,\'94 Littlefinger named him. \'93The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn\'92s death.\'94 \
\'93I shall send for him,\'94 Ned said. \'93And the others.\'94\
Littlefinger winced. \'93My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.\'94 \'93Why?\'94\
\'93Come, and I\'92ll show you, my lord.\'94 \
Frowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 asual gesture. \'93There, across the yard, at the door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?\'94 \
\'93What of him?\'94 \
\'93He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.\'94 He shifted in the window seat. \'93Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?\'94 \
Ned saw the man. \'93Another of the eunuch\'92s w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 isperers?\'94 \
\'93No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better to note who calls on you. There are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat in a brothel?\'94 \
Eddard Stark had no taste for these
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 intrigues. \'93Seven hells,\'94 he swore. It did seem as though the man on the walls was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. \'93Is everyone someone\'92s informer in this cursed city?\'94 \
\'93Scarcely,\'94 said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. \'93Why, there\'92s me, you, the king . . . although, come to think on it, the king tells t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e queen much too much, and I\'92m less than certain about you.\'94 He stood up. \'93Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 said Ned. \
\'93In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,\'94 Littlefinger said with a mocking smile. \'93The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of yours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the Spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.\'94 He started for the door. \
\'93Lord Petyr,\'94 Ned called after him. \'93I . . . am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.\'94 \
Littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. \'93You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was the wisest thing you\'92ve done since
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you climbed down off your horse.\'94 \

JON \
Jon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard. \'93Your feet should
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 be farther apart,\'94 he urged. \'93You don\'92t want to lose your balance. That\'92s good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.\'94 \
Dareon broke off and lifted his visor. \'93Seven gods,\'94 he murmured. \'93Would you look at this, Jon.\'94 \
Jon turned. Through
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. \'93They . . . they told me I was to come here \
for . . . for training,\'94 he said to no one in particular. \
\'93A lordling,\'94 Pyp observed to Jon. \'93Sout
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ron, most like near Highgarden.\'94 Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms wi
\f3 th
\f1  a mummers\'92 troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and wher
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  you\'92d been born just from the sound of your voice. \
A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy\'92s fur-trimmed surcoat. Jon did not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, \'93It wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d seem they have run short of poach
\f3 ers an
\f1 d t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ieves down south. Now they sen
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?\'94 \
It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; pad
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ed doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ted that he reequip himself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly aro
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nd his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. \'93Let us hope you are not as inept as you look,\'94 Ser Alliser said. \'93Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.\'94 \
Jon Snow winced. Halder 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. \'93This will be uglier than a whore\'92s ass,\'94 Pyp muttered, and it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was. \
The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. \'93I yield,\'94 he shrilled. \'93No more, I yield, don\'92t
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hit me.\'94 Rast and some of the other boys were laughing. \
Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. \'93On your feet, Ser Piggy,\'94 he called. \'93Pick up your sword.\'94 When the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o Halder. \'93Hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet.\'94 Halder deliver
\f3 ed a tentativ
\f1 e smack to his foe\'92s upraised cheeks. \'93You can hit harder than that,\'94 Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain. \
Jon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. \'93Jon, no,\'94 the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne. \
\'93On your feet,\'94 Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. \'93Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,\'94 Ser Alliser observed. \'93Again.\'94 \
Halder lifted the sword for another blow. \'93Cut us off a ham!\'94 Rast urged, laughing. \
Jon shook off Pyp\'92s hand. \'93Halder, 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nough.\'94 \
Halder looked to Ser Alliser. \
\'93The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,\'94 the master-at-arms said in that sharp, cold voice of his. \'93I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.\'94 \
\'93Look at him, Halder,\'94 Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. \'93There\'92s no honor in beating a fallen foe. He yielded.\'94 He knelt beside the fat boy. \
Halder lowered his sword. \'93He yielded,\'94 he echoed. \

\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Alliser\'92s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. \'93It would seem our Bastard is in love,\'94 he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet. \'93Show me your ste
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 l, Lord Snow.\'94 \
Jon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it now. \
Thorne smiled. \'93The Bastard wish
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here.\'94 Rast and Albett moved to join Halder. \'93Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u need do is get past the Bastard.\'94 \
\'93Stay behind me,\'94 Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes a
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ainst him, but never three. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He brac
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d himself for the assault. \
Suddenly Pyp was beside him. \'93Three to two will make for better sport,\'94 the small boy said cheerfully. He dropped his visor and sl
\f3 id o
\f1 ut his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third. \
The yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser\'92s eyes. \'93Why are you waiting?\'94 he as
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ft, but it was Jon who moved first. Halder barely got his sword up in time. \
Jon drove hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  backward, att
\f3 acki
\f1 ng with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your foe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once
\f2\fs24 ;
\f1\fs28  Jon knew Halder, brutally strong but short
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of patience, with no taste for def
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nse. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset. \
Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage cut 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a sidestroke into Halder\'92s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pai
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 . The counterstroke caught Jon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder was unbalanced. Jon cut his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash. \
Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd-pressed. Rast had two years and forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper\'92s helm like a bell. As Rast went reeling
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon had moved on. Fa
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ing two swords, Albett backed away. \'93I yield,\'94 he shouted. \
Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. \'93The mummer\'92s farce has gone on lon
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  enough for today.\'94 He walked away. The session was at an end. \
Dareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman\'92s son wrenched off his helm and threw it acr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ss the yard. \'93For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.\'94 \
\'93For an instant, you did,\'94 Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth. \
\'93Let me,\'94 a voice s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. \'93Did he hurt you?\'94 \
\'93I\'92ve been bruised before.\'94 He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them. \
Blood matted the fat boy\'92s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. \'93My name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn . . . \'94 He stopped and licked his lips. \'93I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I . . . left. I\'92ve come to take the black. My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only . . . \'94 His voice trailed off. \
\'93I\'92m Jon Snow, Ned Stark\'92s bastard, of Winterfell.\'94 \
Samwell Tarly nodded. \'93I . . . if you want, you can call me Sam. My mother calls me Sam.\'94 \
\'93You can call him Lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Snow,\'94 Pyp said as he came up to join them. \'93You don\'92t want to know what his mother calls him.\'94 \
\'93These two are Grenn and Pypar,\'94 Jon said. \
\'93Grenn\'92s the ugly one,\'94 Pyp said. \
Grenn scowled. \'93You\'92re uglier than me. At least I don\'92t have ears like a bat.\'94 \
\'93My thanks to all of you,\'94 the fat boy said gravely. \
\'93Why didn\'92t you get up and fight?\'94 Grenn demanded. \
\'93I wanted to, truly. I just . . . I couldn\'92t. I didn\'92t want him to hit me anymore.\'94 He looked at the ground. \'93I . . . I fear I\'92m a coward. My lord father always sai
\f3 d so.\'94 \
Grenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no
\f1  words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything. What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward? \
Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. H
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s eyes met Jon\'92s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. \'93I . . . I\'92m sorry,\'94 h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  said. \'93I don\'92t mean \
to . . . to be like I am.\'94 He walked heavily toward the armory.\
Jon called after him. \'93You were hurt,\'94 he said. \'93Tomorrow you\'92ll do better.\'94 \
Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. \'93No I won\'92t,\'94 he said, blinking b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck tears. \'93I never do better.\'94 \
When he was gone, Grenn frowned. \'93Nobody likes cravens,\'94 he said uncomfortably. \'93I wish we hadn\'92t helped him. What if they think we\'92re craven too?\'94 \
\'93You\'92re too stupid to be craven,\'94 Pyp told him.\
\'93I am not,\'94 Grenn said.\
\'93Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you\'92d be too stupid to run away.\'94 \
\'93I would not,\'94 Grenn insisted. \'93I\'92d run away faster than you.\'94 He stopped suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp\'92s grin and realized what he\'92d just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor. \
Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for work. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon cherished the rare afternoons when 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the Lord Commander\'92s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the armory, spinn
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or pumping the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and inventories. \
That afternoon, 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the Wall, and the air was always c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ld and bracing. He could think here, and he found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly . . . and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, grinning. The wo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ld was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had. \
His sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon finished \
graveling the paths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 own, turning the western sky the color of blood. Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty bar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 els back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him. \
The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall. A group of the black br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 thers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer\'92s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lpless laugh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er, and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp\'92s antics as anyone . . . yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get. \
He was fi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across from him. The fat boy\'92s eyes wide
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed at the sight of Ghost. \'93Is that a wolf?\'94 \
\'93A direwolf,\'94 Jo
\f3 n said. \'93H
\f1 is name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my father\'92s House.\'94 \
\'93Ours is a striding huntsman,\'94 Samwell Tarly said.\
\'93Do you lik
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  to hunt?\'94\
The fat boy shuddered. \'93I hate it.\'94 He looked as though he was going to cry again. \'93What\'92s wrong now?\'94 Jon asked him. \'93Why are you always so frightened?\'94 \
Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk. A burst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Pyp squeaking in a high voice. He stood. \'93Let\'92s go outside.\'94 \
The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. \'93Why? What will we do outside?\'94 \'93Talk,\'94 Jon said. \'93Have you seen the Wall?\'94 \
\'93I\'92m fat, not blind,\'94 Samwell Tarly said. \'93Of co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rse I saw it, it\'92s seven hundred feet high.\'94 Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for \
him in the night. Ghost padded along beside them. \'93I never thought it 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould be like this,\'94 Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the cold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up. \'93All the buildings are falling down, and it\'92s so . . . so . . . \'94 \
\'93Cold?\'94 A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots. \
Sam nodded miserably. \'93I hate the cold,\'94 he said. \'93Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.\'94 \
\'93It must have been warmer where you come from.\'94 \
\'93I never saw snow until last month. We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain. At first I thought 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it would never end.\'94 \
Jon smiled. \
The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon. In the sky above, the stars burned clear and sharp. \'93Are they going to make me go up there?\'94 Sam asked. His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs. \'93I\'92ll die if I have to climb that.\'94 \
\'93There\'92s a winch,\'94 Jon said, pointing. \'93They can draw you up in a cage.\'94 Samwell Tarly sniffled. \'93I don\'92t like high places.\'94 \
It was too much. Jon frowned, incredulous. \'93Are you afraid of everything?\'94 he asked. \'93I don\'92t understand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night\'92s Watch?\'94 \
Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself. He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake. Jon Snow could only stand and watch. Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end. \
It was Ghost who knew what to do. Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly\'92s face. The fat boy cried out,\
startled . . . and somehow, in a heartb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 at, his sobs turned to laughter. \
Jon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost between them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows. It seemed a thousand years ago now. Before long he fo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nd himself talking of Winterfell. \
\'93Sometimes I dream about it,\'94 he said. \'93I\'92m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don\'92t even know who I\'92m looking for. Most nights it\'92s my father, but sometimes it\'92s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, o
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  my uncle.\'94 The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out rangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they\'92d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way. In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben Stark vanished. \
\'93Do you ever find anyone in your dream?\'94 Sam asked. \
Jon shook his head. \'93No one. The castle is always empty.\'94 He had never told anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. \'93Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It\'92s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don\'92t want to. I\'92m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their f
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 et and iron swords across their laps, but it\'92s not them I\'92m afraid of. I scream that I\'92m not a Stark, that this isn\'92t my place, but it\'92s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 m.\'94 He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. \'93That\'92s when I always wake.\'94 His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. \'93Do you dream of Horn Hill?\'94 Jon asked. \
\'93No.\'94 Sam\'92s mouth grew tight and hard. \'93I hated it there.\'94 He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was that a self- confessed coward found himself on the Wall. \
The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. The eldest
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir \
to rich lands, a strong keep, and a storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years. \
Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell\'92s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, soft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of blood, and wept to see even a ch
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 cken slaughtered. A dozen masters-at-arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his mother\'92s clothing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fat
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er and more frightened, until Lord Randyll\'92s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. \'93One time,\'94 Sam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, \'93two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  white skin and blue lips. They sla
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ghtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it didn\'92t make me brave as they\'92d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.\'94 \
Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son. From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to his liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books. \
Until the dawn of his fifteen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 deer. \'93You are almost a man grow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  now, and my heir,\'94 Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare the carcass as 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e spoke. \'93You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither will I allow you to inherit t
\f3 he l
\f1 and and title that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 should be Dickon\'92s. Heartsban
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt. So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ish to take the black. You will forsake all claim to your brother\'92s inheritance and start north before evenfall. \
\'93If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and somewhere
\f3  in 
\f1 these woods y
\f3 our hors
\f1 e will stumble, and you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 will be thrown from the saddle to die . . . or so I will tell your mother. She has a woman\'92s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me. Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are.\'94 His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. \'93So. There is your choice. The Night\'92s Watch\'94\'97he reached inside the deer, ripped
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and dripping\'97\'93or this.\'94 \
Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not to 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im. And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once. When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a time. There was no other sound in all the world. \
Finally Jon said, \'93We should go back to the common hall.\'94 \'93Why?\'94 Sam asked. \
Jon shrugged. \'93There\'92s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is on him. He was a singer, before . . . well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 ow did he come here?\'94 Sam asked. \
\'93Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father\'92s eye she named it rape, so here he is. When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.\'94 Jon smiled. \'93Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father\'92s winesink. Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.\'94 They laughed at that together. \
\'93I should like to hear them both,\'94 Sam admitted, \'93but they would not want me there.\'94 His face was troubled. \'93He\'92s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn\'92t he?\'94 \
\'93He is,\'94 Jon was forced to say. \
Sam got awkwardly to his feet. \'93I had better try to sleep.\'94 He huddled down in his cloak and plodded off. \
The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost. \'93Where h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve you been?\'94 Pyp asked. \
\'93Talking with Sam,\'94 he said. \
\'93He truly is craven,\'94 said Gre
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 n. \'93At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.\'94 \
\'93The Lord of Ham thinks he\'92s too good to eat with the likes of us,\'94 suggested Jeren. \'93I saw him eat a pork pie,\'94 Toad said, smirking. \'93Do you think it was a brother?\'94 He \
began to make oinking noises. \'93Stop it!\'94 Jon snapped angr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ly. \
The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. \'93Listen to me,\'94 Jon said into th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as he\'92d known he would, but when Halder spoke up
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1 \cf3  it was a\cf2  p\cf3 leasant surprise. \cf2 Gr\cf3 enn w
\f2 \cf2 a
\f1 \cf3 s anxious\cf2  a\cf3 t the first, but J\cf2 on\cf3  knew
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 the wor
\f2\b0\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats where threats were requ
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 red. At the end they had all agreed . . . all but Rast. \
\'93You girls do as you please,\'94 Rast
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said, \'93but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I\'92m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.\'94 He laughed in Jon\'92s face and left them there. \
Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on his legs. Jon could hear Rast\'92s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf\'92s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy\'92s throat, just enough to draw blood. \'93Remember, we know where you sleep,\'94 Jon said softly. \
The next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved. \
From that day forth, neith
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Rast nor any of the others would hurt Sam
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ell Tarly. When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screa
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg. Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 yet Sam remained unhurt. A few nights later, at Jon\'92s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder. It was anot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp\'92s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them. \
Fat an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in his cell. \'93I don\'92t know what you did,\'94 he said, \'93but I know you did it.\'94 He looked away shyly. \'93I\'92ve never had a friend before.\'94 \
\'93We\'92re not friends,\'94 Jon said. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e put a hand on Sam\'92s broad shoulder. \'93We\'92re
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brothers.\'94 \
And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb and 
\f2\fs24 B
\f1\fs28 ran and Rickon were his father\'92s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that. The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, and his brothers were \
Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore the black of the Night\'92s Watch. \
\'93My uncle spok
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  truly,\'94 he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him. \

EDDARD \
It\'92s the Hand\'92s tourney that\'92s the cause of all the trouble, my lords,\'94 the Commander of the City Watch complained to the king\'92s c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uncil. \
\'93The king\'92s tourney,\'94 Ned corrected, wincing. \'93I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.\'94 \
\'93Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight we get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and more thieves than I dare guess. This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all these visitors . . . last ni
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters. The night before 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  woman\'92s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool. No one seems to know how it got there or w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 o it belongs to.\'94 \
\'93How dreadful,\'94 Varys said with a shudder. \
Lord Renly Baratheon was le
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 s sympathetic. \'93If you cannot keep the king\'92s peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.\'94 \
Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himse
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f up like an angry frog
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  his bald pate reddening. \'93Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men.\'94 \
\'93How many?\'94 Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session, so it fell to his Hand to spea
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  for him. \
\'93As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.\'94\
\'93Hire fifty new men,\'94 Ned told him. \'93Lord Baelish will see that you g
\f3 et the coin.\'94 \'93I will?\'94 Littlefinger said. \
\'93You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion\'92s purse, surely you can scrape 
\f1 together a few coppers to keep the king\'92s peace.\'94 Ned turned back to Janos Slynt. \'93I will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve \
with the Watch until the crowds have left.\'94 \
\'93All thanks, Lord Hand,\'94 Slynt said, bowing. \'93I p
\f3 romise
\f1  you, they shall be put to good use.\'94 \
When the Commander had taken his leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. \'93The sooner this folly 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s done with, the better I shall like it.\'94 As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting Ned\'92s wound by calling it \'93the Hand\'92s tourney,\'94 as if he were the cause of it. And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored! \
\'93The realm prospers from such events, my lord,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle said. \'93They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\'94 \
\'93And put coins in many a pocket,\'94 Littlefinger added. \'93Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step.\'94 \
Lord Renly la
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ghed. \'93We\'92re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps he\'92d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while he was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his. He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty.\'94 \
Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  had not joined the laughter. \'93I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. I wonder when he intends to en
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.\'94 \
\'93No doubt as soon as we\'92ve scourged all those whores into the sea,\'94 Littlefinger replied, provoking more laughter. \
\'93I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,\'94 Ned said, rising. \'93Until the morrow.\'94 \
H
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. \'93Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,\'94 Ned told him, too brusquely. \
\'93As you say, my lord.\'94 \
The Red Keep and the \'93Hand\'92s tourney\'94 were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as he climbed. He yearned for the comfort of Catelyn\'92s arms, for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the practice yard, for the cool days and cold nights of the north. \
In his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for Jory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. Pycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain he had reasons. There was 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 omething here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only he could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths. \
He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever, a tric
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 gendary as Bran the Builder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the f
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 llow who wink
\f1 led the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book. \
A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon\'92s tome and bid him enter. \'93I\'92ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y is done,\'94 he told him. \'93I rely on you to m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ke the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are ne
\f3 eded to stop figh
\f1 ts, not start them.\'94 Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. \'93Did you find the stableboy?\'94 \
\'93The watchman, my lord,\'94 Jory said. \'93He vows he\'92ll never touch another horse.\'94 \'93What did he have to say?\'94 \
\'93He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were.\'94 Jory snorted. \'93The Hand always 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ave the lads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, so 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hey were always pleased to see him.\'94 \
\'93Carrots and apples,\'94 Ned repea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made kni
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he shoul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards . . . even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been reading more tha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son\'92s frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was full of od
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling \
with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be foster
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d on Dragonstone, the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king\'92s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy said. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis. \
\'93Did our watchman recall anything else of note?\'94 \
\'93The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.\'94 \
Stannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother\'92s name. He had given no word as to when he might return. \'93Where did they go on thes
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rides?\'94 Ned asked. \
\'93The boy says that they visited a brothel.\'94 \
\'93A brothel?\'94 Ned said. \'93The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. Robert\'92s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different sort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim in his sense of duty. \
\'93The boy insists it\'92s true. The Hand took 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hree guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.\'94 \
\'93Which brothel?\'94 Ned asked.\
\'93The boy did not know. The guards would.\'94 \
\'93A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,\'94 Ned said dryly. \'93The gods are doing their best to vex us. Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis . . . everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.\'94 \
\'93Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Not yet,\'94 Ned said. \'93Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ands.\'94 The matter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he played some part in Jon Arryn\'92s murder? Or w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s he afraid? Ned found it hard to imagine what could \
frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm\'92s End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls. \
\'93Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want this armorer to know who I am. It might make him more forthcoming.\'94 \
Jory 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ent to the wardrobe. \'93Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.\'94 \
\'93Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.\'94 Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lo
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ely young girl with doe\'92s eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrell\'92s sister Margaery, he\'92d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. \'93No,\'94 Ned had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing queer. \
Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. \'93Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert\'92s tourney,\'94 he said as Jory laced the garment up the back. \
\'93That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,\'94 Jory said.\
Ned buckled on a longsword. \'93In other words, no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  bloody likely.\'94 His smile was grim. \
Jory draped Ned\'92s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand\'92s badge of office. \'93The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows the way, my lord.\'94 \
Ned nodded. \'93The gods help this potboy if he\'92s sent me off haring after shadows.\'94 It was a slim enough staff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate. Steel was steel; 
\f3 it was meant for protect
\f1 ion, not ornament. He 
\f3 might have changed his v
\f1 iews, to be sure. He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court . . . but the change was marked enough to make Ned wonder. \
\'93Is there any other service I might perform?\'94\
\'93
\f3 I su
\f1 ppose you\'92d best begin visiting whorehouses.\'94 \
\'93Hard duty, my lord
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 Jory grinned. \'93The men will be glad to help. Porther has made a fair start already.\'94 \
Ned\'92s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet they said no word of complaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot. His guard followed. \
He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take, and watch for anyone following
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King\'92s Spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night. \
The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was named on maps, or the Mud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys no older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing out, \'93Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,\'94 and \'93Blood melons, sweet as honey,\'94 and \'93Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onio
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 s, roots, here you go here.\'94 \
The Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort. The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a living thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. \'93Make way for Lord Beric!\'94 the rider shouted. \'93Make way for Lord Beric!\'94 And close behind came the young lord himself, a dashing figure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. \'93Here to fight in the Hand\'92s tourney, my lord?\'94 a guards
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 an called out to him. \'93Here to win the Hand\'92s tourney,\'94 L
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered. \
Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ges, freeriders haggling over mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther they climbed, the larger the bu
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ldings grew. The man they wanted was all the way \
at the top of the hill, in a hug
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors showe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn. Ned left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside. \
The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned\'92s badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master came hurrying out, all smiles and bows. \'93Wine for the King\'92s Hand,\'94 he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a couch. \'93I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.\'94 He wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon\'92s egg. \'93If you are in need of new arms for the Hand\'92s tourney, you have come to the right shop.\'94 Ned did not bother to correct him. \'93My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord,\'94 he said as he filled two matching silver goblets. \'93You will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you. Visit every forge in King\'92s Landing if you like, and compare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shirt of mail; my 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ork is art.\'94 \
Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the ones who k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king\'92s own brother.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly\'92s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? No other armorer in the city could get that deep a gree
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ; he knew the secret of putting color in the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 teel itself, paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as a boy. Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. \'93The direwolf is t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e sigil of House Stark, is it not? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the st
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eet,\'94 he vowed. \
Ned smiled. \'93Did you make a falcon helm for Lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Arryn?\'94 \
Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. \'93The Hand did call upon me, with Lord Stannis, the king\'92s brother. I regret to say, the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  did not honor me with their patrona
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 e.\'94 \
Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time. \
\'93They asked to see t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e boy,\'94 the armorer said, \'93so I took them
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back to the forge.\'94 \
\'93The boy,\'94 Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. \'93I should like to see the boy as wel
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 .\'94 \
Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. \'93As you wish, my lord,\'94 he said with no trace of his former friendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re the work was done. When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon\'92s mouth. Inside, a forg
\f3 e b
\f1 lazed in each 
\f3 corner, 
\f1 and the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hested apprentice boys worked the bellows. \
The master called over a tall lad about Robb\'92s age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. \'93This is Lord Stark, the new
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Hand of the King,\'94 he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and bl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck as ink. The shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. \'93This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad.\'94 Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and a steel helm
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shaped like a bull\'92s head, with two great curving horns. \
Ned turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped. \'93This is fine work. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.\'94 \
The boy snatched it out of his hands. \'93It\'92s not for sale.\'94 \
Tobho Mott looked horror-struck. \'93Boy, t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is is the King\'92s Hand. If his lordship wants this helm, make him a gift of it. He honors you by asking.\'94 \
\'93I made 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t for me,\'94 the boy said stubbornly. \
\'93A hundred pardon
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , my lord,\'94 his master said hurriedly to Ned. \'93The boy is crude as new steel,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and like new steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman\'92s work at best. Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like none you 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave ever seen.\'94 \
\'93He\'92s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did you talk about?\'94 \
\'93He asked me questions is all, m\'92lord.\'94 \'93What sort of questions?\'94 \
The boy shrugged. \'93How was I, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my mother. Who she was and what she lo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ked like and all.\'94 \
\'93What did you tell him?\'94 Ned asked. \
The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his for
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 head. \'93She died when I was little. She had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She work
\f2\fs24 e
\f1 \cf3 d in an a\cf2 le\cf3 house.\'94 \
\'93Did Lor\cf2 d \cf3 Stann
\f2 \cf2 i
\f1 \cf3 s questio\cf2 n \cf3 you as well?\'94 \
\'93T\cf2 he\cf3  bald
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 one? No,
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done for his daughter.\'94 \
\'93Mind your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 filthy tongue,\'94 the master said. \'93This is the King\'92s own Hand.\'94 The boy lowered his eyes. \'93A smart boy, but stubborn. That helm . . . the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.\'94 \
Ned touched the boy\'92s head, fingering the thick black hair. \'93Look at me, Gendry.\'94 The apprentice lifted his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. \'93Go back to your work, lad. I\'92m sorry to have bothered you.\'94 He walked back to the house with the master. \'93Who paid the boy\'92s apprentice fee?\'94 he asked lightly. \
Mott looked fretful. \'93You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.\'94 \
\'93The truth now,\'94 Ned urged. \'93The streets
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?\'94 \
\'93A lord,\'94 the master said reluctantly. \'93He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.\'94 \
\'93Describe him.\'94 \
\'93He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I\'92ll swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I neve
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  did see him clear.\'94 He hesitated a moment. \'93My lord, I want no trouble.\'94 \
\'93None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,\'94 Ned said. \'93You know who the boy is.\'94 \
\'93I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I\'92m told.\'94 \
\'93You know who the boy is,\'94 Ned repeated patiently. \'93That is not a question.\'94 \
\'93The boy is my apprentice,\'94 the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old iron. \'93Who he was before he came to me, that\'92s none of my concern.\'94 \
Ned nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. \'93If the day ever comes when Gendry would rather wie
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has the look of a warrior. Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise. Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first place I visit.\'94 \
His guard was waiting outside with the horses. \'93Did you find anything, my lord?\'94 Jacks asked as Ned mounted up. \
\'93I did,\'94 Ned told him, 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ondering. What had Jon 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 rryn wanted with a king\'92s bastard, and why was it worth his life? \

CATELYN \
My lady, you ought cover your head,\'94 Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north. \'93You will take a chill.\'94 \
\'93It is only water, Ser Rodrik,\'94 Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother\'92s kisses. It took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother\'92s laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her fingers
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\'92d eaten so much mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. \
Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That was no rain for little girls to play in. \
\'93I am soaked through,\'94 Ser Rodrik complained. \'93Even my bones are wet.\'94 The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves p
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 lled free of the mud. \'93We will want a fire tonight, my la
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 y, and a hot meal would serve us both.\'94 \
\'93There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,\'94 Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his pr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 me, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha\'92s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror. \
\'93An inn,\'94 Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. \'93If only . . . but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain unknown, I think it best we seek out some small ho
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 dfast . . . \'94 He broke off as they heard sounds up the road; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse\'92s whinny. \'93Riders,\'94 he warned, his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it \
never hurt to be wary. \
They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily for
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ing a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of Seagard. \'93Mallisters,\'94 Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. \'93My lady, best
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pull up your hood.\'94 \
Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for King\'92s Landing and the Hand\'92s tourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south. \
She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair was salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He rode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the riders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord\'92s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a look. \
\'93He did not know you,\'94 Ser Rodrik said after, wondering. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik.\'94 \
It was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave them only the most cursory of look
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. \'93Two rooms at the top of the stair, that\'92s all there is,\'94 she said, chewing all the while. \'93They\'92re under the bell tower, you won\'92t be missing meals, though there\'92s some thinks it too noisy. Can\'92t be helped. We\'92re full up, or near as makes no matter. It\'92s those rooms or 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he road.\'94 \
It was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. \'93Leave your boots down here,\'94 Masha told them after she\'92d taken their coin. \'93The boy will clean them. I won\'92t have you tracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to meals don\'92t eat.\'94 There were no smiles, and no mention of sweet cakes. \
When the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry clothes. She sat by the window, watching rain run down the pane. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e glass was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk was falling outside. Catelyn co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met. \
The crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down to Riverrun. Her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer to King\'92s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If only her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now. \
The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she would find her sister . . . and, perha
\f3 ps, 
\f1 some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew more than she
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if it c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 me to war, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service. \
Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and the mountain cla
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 s were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the Eyrie had ever known
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. Catelyn\'92s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty. \
No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned\'92s bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with ord
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rs to mount a watch on the kingsroad. \
The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of here the king
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 road ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and green woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords. \
Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels \
her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d filled his twin castles with children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 would be enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who\'92d ever lived, and she had no doub
\f3 t t
\f1 hat he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to joi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must not let it. \
Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. \'93We had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady.\'94 \
\'93It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck,\'94 she told
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. \'93Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on some family business, say.\'94 \
\'93As y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u say, my lady,\'94 Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he\'92d done. \'93The old courtesies 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ie hard, my\'97my daughter.\'94 He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation. \
Catelyn t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ok his arm. \'93Come, Father,\'94 she said. \'93You\'92ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise her. You truly don\'92t want to see her smile.\'94 \
The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing her sou
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 leaf all the while. \
The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 rossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d septon, hard-bitten sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions. \
The company included more s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fire wore
\f3  the 
\f1 red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a si
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 very grey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, but they were all too young to have \
known her. The senior among them would have been no older than Bran when she went north. \
Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 itchen. Across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp. \'93Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,\'94 he said as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93And to you, singer,\'94 Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were going, and from whe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ce they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer. \'93We left King\'92s Landing a fortnight ago,\'94 Catelyn replied, answering the safest of his questi
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ns. \
\'93That\'92s where I\'92m bound,\'94 the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 The Hand\'92s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry . . . or would have, if I hadn\'92
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.\'94 \
\'93The gods frown on the gambler,\'94 Ser Rodrik said sternly. He 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as of the north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments. \
\'93They frowned on me, for certain,\'94 the singer said. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers altogether did me in.\'94 \
\'93No doubt that was a lesson for you,\'94 Ser Rodrik said. \'93It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not the
\f3 re, bu
\f1 t before he could frame a rebuke t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 eat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat mushrooms. Ser
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer. \
\'93My name is Marillion,\'94 the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. \'93Doubtless you\'92ve heard me play somewhere?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterf
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll, but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. \'93I fear not,\'94 she told him. \
He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. \'93That is your loss,\'94 he said. \'93Who was the finest singer you\'92ve ever heard?\'94 \
\'93Alia of Braavos,\'94 Ser Rodrik
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 answered at once. \
\'93Oh, I\'92m much better than that old stick,\'94 Maril
\f3 lion said. \'93If you hav
\f1 e the silver for a song, I\'92ll gladly show you.\'94 \
\'93I might have a copper or two
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  but I\'92d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,\'94 Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword. \
\'93Your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 grandfather has a sour nature,\'94 Marillion said to 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 atelyn. \'93I meant to do you honor. An homage to your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.\'94 \
\'93Oh, I can see that,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doub
\f3 t you\'92ve been to Rive
\f1 rrun.\'94 \
\'93A hundred times,\'94 the singer said airily. \'93They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a brother.\'94 \
Catelyn smiled, wonder
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. \'93And Winterfell?\'94 she asked him. \'93Have you traveled north?\'94 \
\'93Why would I?\'92 Marillion asked. \'93It\'92s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves.\'94 Distantly, she was aware of the door ban
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ing open at the far end of the room. \
\'93Innkeep,\'94 a servant\'92s voice called out behind her, \'93we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.\'94 \
\'93O
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 , gods,\'94 Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard around his forearm. \
Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. \'93I\'92m sorry, m\'92lord, truly, we\'92re full up, every room.\'94 \
There were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night\'92s Watch, two servants . . . and him, standing there small and bold as life. \'93My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a large room, as you can plainly see.\'94 He \
flashed a mocking grin. \'93So long as the fire\'92s warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Masha Heddle was beside herself. \'93M\'92lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , there\'92s nothing, it\'92s the tourney, there\'92s no help for it, oh . . . \'94 \
Tyrion Lannister
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pulled a coin from his purse and fl
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 cked it up over his head, caught it, tossed it again. Even across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was unmistakable. \
A freerider in a 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 aded blue cloak lurched to his feet. \'93You\'92re welcome to my room, m\'92lord.\'94 \
\'93Now there\'92s a clever man,\'94 Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  freerider snatched it from the air. \'93And a nimble one to boot.\'94 The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. \'93You will 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 e able to manage food, I trust?\'94 \
\'93Anything you like, m\'92lord, anything at all,\'94 the innkeep promised. And may he choke on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it, Catelyn thought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood. \
Lannister glanced at the nearest tables. \'93My men will have whatever you\'92re serving these people. Double portions, we\'92ve had a long hard r
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 de. I\'92ll take a roast fowl\'97chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter. And send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup with me?\'94 \
\'93Aye, m\'92lord, I will,\'94 the black bro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her replied. \
The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. \'93My lord of Lannister!\'94 he called out. \'93I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you the lay of your fathe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 \'92s great victory at King\'92s Landing!\'94 \
\'93Nothing would be more likely to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ruin my supper,\'94 the dwarf said dryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away . . . and fou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1 \cf3 d Catelyn\cf2 . \cf3 He looked at her f\cf2 or\cf3  a mo
\f2 \cf2 m
\f1 \cf3 ent, puzz\cf2 le\cf3 d. She turned her \cf2 fa\cf3 ce aw
\f2 \cf2 a
\f0\b\fs38 y, but
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 too late. The dwarf was smiling. \'93Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,\'94 he said. \'93I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.\'94 \
Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heard Ser Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only . . . \
\'93Lady . . . Stark?\'94 Masha Heddle said thickly. \
\'93I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,\'94 she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. \'93You in the corner,\'94 she said to an older man she had not noticed until n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w. \'93Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?\'94 \
The man got to his feet. \'93It is, my lady.\'94 \
\'93And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\'94 \
\'93She is,\'94 the man replied stoutly. \
Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking at them, blank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes. \
\'93The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,\'94 she said to the trio by the fire. \'93My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\'94 \
The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. \'93Our lord is honored by his trust,\'94 one of them said hesitantly. \
\'93I envy your father all these fine friends,\'94 Lannister quipped, \'93but I do not quite see the purpose of this, Lady Stark.\'94 \
She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the matter; there were more than twenty of them. \'93I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good lord, sers?\'94 \
Their captain rose. \'93Lo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. \'93This man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,\'94 she proclaimed to the room at large, pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in hand. \'93In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize \
him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king\'92s justice.\'94 \
She did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on Tyrion Lannister\'92s face. \

SANSA \
Sansa rode to the Hand\'92s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right throug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  them. They turned the whole world gold. Beyond the city walls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games. The splendor of it all took Sansa\'92s breath away; the shining armor, the great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the win
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  . . . and the knights themselves, the knights most of all. \
\'93It is better than the songs,\'94 she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her, among the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair, and she knew they were looking at her and smiling. \
They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. The seven knights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot, with a lion\'92s- head helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain That Rides, thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had guested at Winter
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ell two years before. \'93His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm,\'94 she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in indigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar\'92s bannermen on the Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red robes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming sword in hand. \
O
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of Dorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser houses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that one day the Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Bronze Yohn\'92s heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes, burgundy on blue. Patrek Mallister, Lord Jason\'92s son. Six Freys of the \
Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser Emmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son Martyn Rivers as well. \
Jeyne Poole confessed herself frightened
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer Isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when she saw young Lord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightnin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 , she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant. \
The Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king\'92s brother, handsome Lord Renly of Storm\'92s End. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. \'93Jory looks a beggar among these others,\'94 Septa Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only agree. Jory\'92s armor was blue-grey plate without device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he acquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In his third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his own. Neither man l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 st his seat, but Brune\'92s lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king gave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his firs
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  tilt by Ser Meryn of the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann. \
The jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times Jeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters while the commons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little girl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa Mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval. \
The Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as easily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy, who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ears his junior. \
Sandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser Gregor\'92s second joust, when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through his throat, killi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where Sansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor\'92s lance had snapped off in his neck, and his life\'92s blood flowed out in slow p
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 lses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the \
light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it was gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 \'92s day, trimmed with a border of crescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by one. \
Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination. She had never seen a man die before. She ought to be c
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she told herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world would forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That was sad. \
After they carried off the body, a boy wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed. \
Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was just 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath him. When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert\'92s handsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broke
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  antler into the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored the peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she exp
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ained; she had helped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne. \
Later a hedge knigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  in a checkered c
\f3 loa
\f1 k disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion\'92s horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and Loth
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward to Lord Jason Mallister, and Brune to Yohn Royce\'92s younger son, Robar. \
In the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of Flowers. \
Ser Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. At sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen \
anyone so beautiful. His pla
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e was intrica
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ely fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd. \
His last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar\'92s ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. When the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst. \
To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. \'93Sweet lady,\'94 he said, \'93no victory is half so beautifu
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  as you.\'94 Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes like liquid gold. She inhaled the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off. \
When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. \'93You must be one of her daughters,\'94 he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. \'93You have the Tully look.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m Sansa Stark,\'94 she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 I have not had the honor, my lord.\'94 \
Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. \'93Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king\'92s small council.\'94 \
\'93Your mother was my queen of beauty once,\'94 the man said quietly. His breath smelled of mint. \'93You have her hair.\'94 His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he turned and walked away. \
By then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last three matches would be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons began their walk home, talking of the day\'92s jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, tu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh- \
baked bread. \
Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high h
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nor, to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten. He had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to him. At first she thought she hated him for what they\'92d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey\'92s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya. \
She could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion\'92s heads, and around his brow a slim co
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 onet made of gold and sapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might ignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table. \
Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs, and said, \'93Ser L
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.\'94 \
\'93He was too kind,\'94 she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart was singing. \'93Ser Loras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Jof
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rey said. \'93My dog will do 
\f3 fo
\f1 r him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.\'94 He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa\'92s cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and s
\f3 aid not anoth
\f1 er
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 word. \
The servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine. She needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king\'92s pavilion, filling the dusk with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 clubs spinning through the air. The king\'92s own fool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with com
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 liments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy\'92s japes. Sansa was 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 o captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left. \
All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgras
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails before; Joffrey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. Then came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 rince helped her crac
\f3 k op
\f1 en
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself, slicing a queen\'92s portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he moved that his right arm was still tr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint. \
Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar, but by then San
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 a was so stu
\f3 ffed 
\f1 that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout. \
King Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  cutlery, but they were too far away for her to make out his words. \
Now everybody heard him. \'93No,\'94 he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. \'93You do not tell me what to do, woman,\'94 he screamed at Queen Cersei. \'93I am king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\'94 \
Everyone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king\'92s brother Renly, and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere. The queen\'92s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing be
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ind. \
Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king\'92s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard.
\f3  La
\f1 nnister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. \'93The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Reme
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ber that, Kingslayer.\'94 He slapped his chest with 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he jeweled goblet, splashing wi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e all over his satin tunic. \'93Give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!\'94 \
Jaime Lannister rose
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and brushed himself off. \'93As you say, Your Grace.\'94 His voice was stiff. \
Lord Renly came forward, smiling. \'93You\'92ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let me bring you a fresh goblet.\'94 \
Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. \'93It grows late,\'94 the prince said. He had a queer look on his face, as if he w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re not seeing her at all. \'93Do you need an escort back to the castle?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Sansa began. She looked for Septa 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 rdane, and was startled to
\f1  find her with her head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores. \'93I mean to say . . . yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am tired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some protection.\'94 \
Joffrey called out, \'93Dog!\'94 \
Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog\'92s head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red. \'93Yes, Your Grace?\'94 he said. \
\'93Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that n
\f3 o harm befa
\f1 lls her,\'94 the prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her there. \
Sansa could feel the Hound watching her. \'93Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?\'94 He laughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. \'93Small chance of th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t.\'94 He pulled her unresisting to her feet. \'93Come, you\'92re not the only one needs sleep. I\'92ve drunk too much, and I may need 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o kill my brother tomorrow.\'94 He laughed again. \
Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane\'92s shoulder, hoping to wake her, but she only snored the louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were 
\f3 sudden
\f1 ly empty. The feast
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was over, and the beautiful dream had ended with it. \
The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The ground was rocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept her eyes lowered, watching where she placed her feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and its armor hung outside,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of him, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not notice his face, she told herself. \'93You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,\'94 she made herself say. \
Sandor Clegane snarled at her. \'93Spare me your empty little compl
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ments, girl . . . and your ser\'92s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you see him ride today?\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Sansa whispered, trembling. \'93He was . . . \
\'93Gallant?\'94 the Hound finished. \
He was mocking her, she realized. \'93No one could withstand him,\'94 she managed at last, proud of herself. It was no lie. \
Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no choice but to stop beside him. \'93Some septa trained you well. You\'92re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, aren\'92t you? A pretty little talking bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s unkind.\'94 Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. \'93You\'92re frightening me. I want to go now.\'94 \
\'93No one could withstand him,\'94 the Hound rasped. \'93That\'92s truth enough. No one could ever withstand Gregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you? Fool boy, he had no business riding in this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that armor. That gorget wasn\'92t fastened proper. You think Gregor didn\'92t notice that? You think Ser Gregor\'92s lance rode up by chance, do you? 
\f2\fs24 P
\f1\fs28 retty little talking girl, you believe that, you\'92re empty-headed as a bird for true. Gre
\f3 gor\'92s lance
\f1  goes where Gregor wants it to go. Look at me. Look at me!\'94 Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He squatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. \'93There\'92s a pret
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 y for you. Take a good long stare. You know you want to. I\'92ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that. Take your look.\'94 \
His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sullen with anger. She had to look. \
The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow. His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it s
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 deways, because no hair grew on the other side of that face. \
The left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole. Hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away. \
Sansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. \'93No pretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?\'94 When there was no answer, he continued. \'93Most of them, they think
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it was some battle. A siege, a burning to
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 er, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it was dragonsbreath.\'94 His laugh \
was softer this time, but just as bitter. \'93I\'92ll tell you what it was, girl,\'94 he said, a voice from th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath. \'93I was younger tha

\f1\fs28 . The old man made marvelous toys. I don\'92t remember what I got, but it was Gregor\'92s gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged separate and fixed wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who\'92s been burned knows what hell is truly like. \
\'93My
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments. Ointments! Gregor go
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  his ointments too
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, \'91Arise, Ser Gregor.\'92 \'94 \
The rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She was sad for him, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away. \
The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she was afraid for him now, not for herself. She found his ma
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 sive shoulder with her hand. \'93He was no true knight,\'94 she whispered to him. \
The Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but he caught her arm. \'93
\f2\fs24 N
\f1\fs28 o,\'94 he growled at her, \'93no, little bird, he was no true knight.\'94 \
The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the carts were waitin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 , told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her. They rode in silence through the King\'92s Gate and up torchlit city streets. He opened the postern door and 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ed her into the castle, his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber. \
\'93Thank you, my lord,\'94 Sansa said meekly. \
The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. \'93The things I told you tonight,\'94 he said, his voice sounding even rougher than usual. \'93If you ever tell Joffrey . . . your sister, \
your father . . . any of them . . . \'94\
\'93I won\'92t,\'94 Sansa whispered. \'93I promise.\'94\
It was not enough. \'93If you ever tell anyone,\'94 he finished, \'93I\'92ll kill you.\'94 \

EDDARD \
I stood last vigil for him myself,\'94 Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart. \'93He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told.\'94 \
In the pal
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not been handsome, but death had smoothed 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had ma
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his face, and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman before Ned could speak to him; could tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know. \
\'93Hugh was Jon Arryn\'92s squire for four years,\'94 Selmy went on. \'93The king knighted him before he rode north, in Jon\'92s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready.\'94 \
Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. \'93None of us is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ever ready,\'94 he said. \
\'93For knighthood?\'94 \
\'93For death.\'94 Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King\'92s Hand, Eddard Stark. \'93This was needless. War should not be a game.\'94 Ned turned to the woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y
\f3 es. The sile
\f1 nt sisters prepared men for the grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. \'93Send his armor home to the 
\f3 Vale. The m
\f1 other will want to have it.\'94 \
\'93It is worth a fair piece of silver,\'94 Ser Barristan said. \'93The boy had it forged special for the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.\'94 \
\'93He paid yeste
\f3 rd
\f1 ay, my lord, and he paid dearly,\'94 Ned replie
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . And to the silent sister he said, \'93Send the mother the armor. I will deal with this smith.\'94 She bowed her head. \
Afterward Ser Barristan wal
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed with Ned to the king\'92s pavilion. The camp was beginning to stir. Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic \
a
\f3 nd 
\f1 pepper. Young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goos
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. \'93M\'92lords,\'94 he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant: the silver eagle 
\f3 of Seagard, Bryce Caron\'92s fiel
\f1 d 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn, dancing maiden, blackadder, twin towers, horned owl, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn. \
\'93The king means to fight in the melee today,\'94 Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn\'92s shield, its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell\'92s lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im that news. Small wonder he had slept so badly. \
Ser Barristan\'92s look was troubled. \'93They say night\'92s beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are oft dis
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wned in the morning light.\'94 \
\'93They say so,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Ned agreed, \'93but not of Robert.\'94 Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering, would never back down. \
The king\'92s pavilion was close by the water, and the
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 morning mists off the r
\f1 iver had wreathed it in wisps of grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance, Robert\'92s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House Baratheon. \
Ned had hoped to 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 iscover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with him. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires wh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  were trying to buckle him into his armor. \'93Your Grace,\'94 one was saying, almost in tears, \'93it\'92s made too small, it won\'92t go.\'94 He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t around Robert\'92s thick neck tumbled to the ground. \
\'93Seven hells!\'94 Robert swore. \'93Do I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 have to do it myself? Piss on the bot
\f3 h of 
\f1 you. Pick it up. Don\'92t just stand there gaping, Lancel
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  pick it up!\'94 The lad jumped, and the 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing noticed his company. \'93Look at these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they\'92re worse than useless. Can\'92t even put a man\'92s armor on him properly. Squires, they say. I say they\'92re swineh
\f3 erds
\f1  dressed u
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  in silk.\'94 \
Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. \'93The boys are not at fault,\'94 he told the king. \'93You\'92re too fat for your armor, Robert.\'94 \
Robert Baratheo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his han
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , and said darkly, \'93Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?\'94 He let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. \'93Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?\'94 \
The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. \'93You. Yes, both of you. You heard the Hand. The king is to
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher. Now
\f3 ! What are
\f1  yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  waiting for?\'94 \
The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the ten
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . Robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with laughter. \
Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always, though, the graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires: handsome boys, fai
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  and well made. One was Sansa\'92s age, with long golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  with a wisp of a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen. \
\'93Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar\'92s face,\'94 Robert said. \'93I hope he
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 ll have the wit to 
\f3 send 
\f1 them to someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!\'94 \
\'93Those boys,\'94 Ned asked him. \'93Lannisters?\'94 \
Rober
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. \'93Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin\'92s brother. One of the dead ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 t recall. My wife comes from a very larg
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  family, Ned.\'94 \
A very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen\'92s kin, waking and sleeping. The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 no bounds. \'93The 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 alk is you and the queen had angry words last night.\'94 \
The mirth curdled on Robert\'92s face. \'93The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee. She\'92s sulking in the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like that.\'94 \
\'93You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,\'94 Ned told him. \'93You saw her beauty, but not the iron underneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.\'94 \
\'93You too?\'94 The king frowned. \'93You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the \
juices have frozen inside you. Well, mine are still running.\'94 He slapped his chest to prove it. \
\'93You
\f3  are 
\f1 the king,\'94 Ned reminded him. \
\'93I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don\'92t have the same hungers as other men? A bit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, the feel of a horse between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, I want to hit someone.\'94 \
Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up. \'93Your Grace,\'94 he said, \'93it is not seemly that the king should rid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  into the melee. It would not b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  a fair contest. Who would dare strike you?\'94 \
Robert seemed honestly taken aback. \'93Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. And the last man left standing . . . \'94 \
\'93 . . . will be you,\'94 Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. \'93Ser Barristan is right. There\'92s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasur
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  by hurting you.\'94 \
The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. \'93Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?\'94 \
\'93For a certainty,\'94 Ned said, and Ser Barristan S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lmy bowed his head in silent accord. \
For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back, his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. \'93Get out,\'94 the kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  said then, coldly. \'93Get out before I kill
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you.\'94 \
Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. \'93Not you, Ned.\'94 \
Ned turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner, and thrust it at Ned. \'93Drink,\'94 he said brusquely. \
\'93I\'92ve no thirst\'97\'94\
\'93Drink. Your king commands it.\'94\
Ned took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung the eyes. \
Robert sat down again. \'93Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.\'94 \
\'93You had the better claim, Your Grace.\'94 \
\'93I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me. Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?\'94 \
\'93Robert . . . \'94 \
\'93Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I\'92ve won it. And Cersei . . . I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever try to win back his father\'92s throne.\'94 The king shook his head. \'93I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold . . . the way she guards her cunt, you\'92d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs. Here, give me that beer if you won\'92t drink it.\'94 He took the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his mouth. \'93I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was lying, I\'92d stake my soul on it. My son . . . you love your children, don\'92t you?\'94 \
\'93With all my heart,\'94 Ned said. \
\'93Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown. Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d my time warring and whoring, that\'92s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me. You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have made a son like that, Ned?\'94 \
\'93He\'92s only a boy,\'94 Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince Joffr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y, but he could hear the pain in Robert\'92s voice. \'93Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?\'94 \
\'93It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don\'92t know him as I do.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  He sighed and shook his head. \'93Ah, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me often enough, yet I grew into a good king.\'94 Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence. \'93Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u might speak up and agree now, you know.\'94 \
\'93Your Grace . . . \'94 Ned began, carefully. \
Robert slapped Ned on the back. \'93Ah, say that I\'92m a better king than Aerys and be done with it. You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I\'92m still young, and now that you\'92re here with me, things will be diffe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ent. We\'92ll make this a reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells. I smel
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  bacon. Who do you think our champion will be today? Have you seen Mace Tyrell\'92s boy? The Knight 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f Flowers, they call him. Now there\'92s a son any m
\f3 an wou
\f1 ld be proud to own to. Last tourney, he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei\'92s face. I laughed till my sides hurt. Renly say
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  he has this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn . . . \'94 \
They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon, at a trestle table by the river\'92s edge. The king\'92s melancholy melted away with the morning mist, and before long Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys. \'93 . . . had given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose. You remember, Redf
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rt\'92s pock-faced squire? He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so much as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction.\'94 He laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering. \
This was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; this was the Robert Baratheon he\'92d known and loved. If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran, prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. Then Cersei would fall, and the Kingslayer with her, and if Lord Tywin dared to rouse the west, Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He could see it 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll so clearly. \
That breakfast tasted bet
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time, and afterward his smiles came easier and more often, until it was time for the tournament to resu
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e. \
Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and his daughter was determined not t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  miss the end of the jousting. As he saw Robert to his place, he noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear; the place beside the king was empty. That too gave Ned cause to hope. \
He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the day\'92s first joust. Sansa was so engrossed she scarc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ly seemed to notice his arrival. \
Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore an olive- green cloak over his soot- grey armor. That, and his hound\'92s-head helm, were his only concession to ornament. \
\'93A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,\'94 Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered the lists, riding an elegant blood bay destrier. The horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail, and Jaime glittered from head to heel. Even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles. \
\'93Done,\'94 Lord Renly shouted back. \'93The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 E
\f1\fs28 ven hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,\'94 Littlefinger called dryly. \
Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position. Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered his visor, and rode to the end of the lists. Both men couched their lances. \
Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but Sansa was watching it all moist-eyed and eager. The hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses broke into a gallop. The Hound leaned forward as he rode, his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lance rock steady, but Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact. Clegane\'92s point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon, while his own hit square. Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep his seat. Sansa gasped. A ragged cheer went up from the commons. \
\'93I wonder how I ought spend your money,\'94 Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly. \
The Hound just managed to stay in his saddle. He jerked his mount around hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down his broken lance and snatched up a fresh one, jesting with his squire. The Hound spurred forward at a hard gallop. Lannister rode to meet him. This time, when Jaime shifted his seat, Sandor Clegane shifted with him. Both lances exploded, and by the time the splinters had settled, a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while Ser Jaime Lannister rolled in the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dirt, golden and dented. \
Sansa said, \'93I knew the Hound would win.\'94 \
Littlefinger overheard. \'93If you know who\'92s going to win th
\f3 e second 
\f1 match, speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean,\'94 he called to her. Ned smiled. \
\'93A pity the Imp is not here with us,\'94 Lord Renly said. \'93I should have won twice as much.\'94 Jaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted \
around and dented in his fall, and now he could not get it off. The commons were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, and failing, and over it all Ned could hear 
\f2\fs24 K
\f1\fs28 ing Robert laughing, louder than anyone. Finally they had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and stumbling. \
By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists. He was huge, the biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen. Robert Baratheon and his brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 night they called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor. He was well over seven feet tall, closer to eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees. His destrier seemed a pony in be
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ween his armored legs, and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle. \
Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 been with Lord Tywin when King\'92s Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. Some said it had been Gregor who\'92d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword. These things were not said in Gregor\'92s hearing. \
Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy\'92s reb
\f3 ellio
\f1 n, one knight among thousands. He watched him with disquiet. Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ere more than ominous. He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 oung under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident\
that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot even to visit. \
When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and he heard Sansa\'92s fervent whisper, \'93Oh, he\'92s so beautiful.\'94 Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines
\f3  and tiny
\f1  blue forget-me-nots. The commons realized in the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 apphires; a gasp went up from a thousand throats. Across the boy\'92s shoulders his cloak hung heavy. It was woven of forget-me-nots, real ones, hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape. \
His courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  built for speed. Ser Gregor\'92s huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent. The boy from Highgarden did something with his legs, and his horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. Sansa clutched at his arm. \'93Father, don\'92t let Ser Gregor hurt
\f3  him,\'94 she s
\f1 aid. Ned saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had

\f1\fs28 iven her yesterday. Jory had told him about that as well. \
\'93These are tourney lances,\'94 he told his daughter. \'93They make them to splinter on impact, so no one is hurt.\'94 Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons, and the words were raw in his throat. \
Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse. The stallion was screaming and pawing the ground, shaking his head. The Mountain kicked at t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e animal savagely with an armored boot. The horse reared and almost threw him. \
The Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and couched his lance, ready. Ser Gregor brought his animal to the line, fighting with the reins. And suddenly it began. The Mountain\'92s stallion br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ke in a hard gallop, plunging forward wildly, while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk. Ser Gregor wrenched his shield into position, juggled with his lance, and all the while fought to hold his unruly mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on him, placing the point of his lance just there, and in an eye bl
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nk the Mountain was failing. He was so huge that h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  took his horse down with him in a tangle of steel and flesh. \
Ned heard applause, cheers, whist
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 es, shocked gasps, excited muttering, and over it all the rasping, raucous laughter of the Hound. The Knight of Flowers reined up at the end of the lists. His lance was not even broken. His sapphires win
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed in the
\f3  su
\f1 n as he raised his visor, smiling. The commons went mad for him. \
In the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to his feet. He wrenched off his helm and slammed it dow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  onto the ground. His face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes. \'93My sword,\'94 he shouted to his squire, and the boy ran it out to him. By then his stallion was back on its feet as well. \
Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animal\'92s neck. Cheers turned to shrieks in a h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 artbeat. The stallion went to its knees, screaming as it died. By then Gregor was striding down th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell, his bloody sword clutched in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his fist. \'93Stop him!\'94 Ned shouted, but his words were lost in the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa was crying. \
It all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser Gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. The mare scented blood and reared. Loras Tyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung his \
sword, a savage two-ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ded blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay stunned in the dirt. But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, \'93Leave him be,\'94 and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy. \
The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive strength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim savage blows at the hound\'92s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his brother\'92s unprotected face. \
It was the king\'92s voice that put an end to it . . . the king\'92s voice and twenty s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ords. Jon Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had proved the truth of that on the Trident. He used that voice now. \'93STOP THIS MADNESS,\'94 he boomed, \'93IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!\'94 \
The Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor\'92s blow cut air, and at last he came to
\f3  his senses
\f1 . He dropped his sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen. Wordlessly, he turned and strode off, shovi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g past Barristan Selmy. \'93Let him go,\'94 Robert said, and a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  quickly as that, it was over. \
\'93Is the Hound the champion now?\'94 Sansa asked Ned. \
\'93No,\'94 he told her. \'93There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers.\'94 \
But Sansa had the right of it after all. A few 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 oments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, \'93I owe you my life. The day is you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s, ser.\'94 \
\'93I am no ser,\'94 the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion\'92s purse, and, for perhaps the first time in his life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion. \
As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in with them.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat,\'94 Littlefinger was saying. \'93I swear the boy planned the w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ole thing. Gregor has always favored huge, ill- te
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 pered stallions with more spirit than sense.\'94 The notion seemed to amuse him. \
It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. \'93There is small honor in tricks,\'94 the old man said stiffly. \
\'93Small honor and twenty thousand golds.\'94 Lord Renly smi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ed. \
That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unher
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand\'92s guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused. \
The melee went
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge knights and new-made
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and blood, small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured, until only one man was left standing. The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken limbs, a shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that had to be put down, and more cuts, sprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not 
\f3 taken
\f1  part. \
That night at the feast, Eddard Stark
\f3  was mo
\f1 re hopeful than 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e had been in a great while. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and even his daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly. \'93The tournament was magnificent,\'94 she sighed. \'93You should have come. How was your dancing?\'94 \
\'93I\'92m sore all over,\'94 Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg. \
\'93You must be a te
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 rible dancer,\'94 Sansa said doubtfully. \
Later, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven ballads called the \'93Dance of the Dragons,\'94 Ned inspected the bruise himself. \'93I hope Forel is not being too hard on you,\'94 he said. \
Arya stoo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. \'93Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better.\'94 \
Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya\'92s slender blade, y
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t still . . . a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she told him. Before \
that, he had her doing spins and back flips. \'93Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?\'94 \
She nodded. \'93Tomorrow we\'92re going to catch cats.\'94 \
\'93Cats.\'94 Ned sighed. \'93Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take over your lessons. Or I mig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want them,\'94 Arya said. \'93I want Syrio.\'94 \
Ned ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartw
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eels, and hopping about on one leg, but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that st
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 bborn jut of jaw. \'93As you wish,\'94 he 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. Surely she would grow tired of this soon. \'93Try to be careful.\'94 \
\'93I will,\'94 she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left. \
Much later, after he h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d taken the girls back thr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ugh the city and seen them both safe in bed, Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand. The day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfaste
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 d the heavy
\f1  shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from Littl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 finger\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die. \
He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger\'92s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep. Wh
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ? Why would the dwarf want Bran dead
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  Why would anyone want Bran dead? \
The dagger, Bran\'92s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, he could feel it in his gut, but the truth of Jon\'92s death remaine
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  as clouded to him as when he had started. Lord Stannis had not returned to King\'92s Landing for the tourney. Lysa Arryn held her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. The squire was dead, and Jory was still searching the whorehouses. What did he have but Robert\'92s bastard? \
That the armorer\'92s sullen apprentice was the king\'92s son, Ned had no doubt. The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. Renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud in his honor. Gendry had to be Robert\'92s. \
Yet k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 owing all that, what had he learned? The king
\f3  had
\f1  other baseborn children scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms. He had openly acknowledged o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e of his bastards, a boy of B
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 an\'92s age whose mother was highborn. The lad was being fostered by Lord Renly\'92s castellan at Storm\'92s End. \
Ned remembered R
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 bert\'92
\f3 s first 
\f1 child as well, a daughter born in the Vale when Robert was scarcely more than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm\'92s End had doted on her. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e used to make daily visits to play with the babe, long after he had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he realized; older 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 han Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought. \
Cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband\'92s by-blows, yet in the end it mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred. Law and custom gave the baseborn few rights. Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm\'92s End, none of them could threaten Robert\'92s trueborn children . . . \
His musings were ended by a soft rap on his door. \'93A man to see you, my lord,\'94 Harwin called. \'93He will not give his name.\'94 \
\'93Send him in,\'94 Ned said, wondering. \
The visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun, his features hidden by a cowl, his hands drawn up into voluminous sleeves. \
\'93Who are you?\'94 Ned asked. \
\'93A friend,\'94 the cowled man said in a strange, low voice. \'93We must speak alone, Lord S
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ark.\'94 \
Curiosity was stronger than caution. \'93Harwin, leave us,\'94 he command
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. Not until they were alone behind cl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 sed doors did his visitor draw back h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s cowl. \
\'93Lord Varys?\'94 Ned said in astonishment.\
\'93Lord Stark,\'94 Varys said politely, seating himself. \'93I wonder if I might trouble you for a \
drink
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys. \'93I might have passed within a foot of 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou and never recognized you,\'94 he said, incredulous. He had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but silk an
\f3 d velvet and the ric
\f1 hest damasks, and this man 
\f3 \
smelled of sweat instead of lilacs. \
\'93Th
\f1 at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was my dearest hope,\'94 Varys said. \'93It would not do i
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  certain people learned that we had spoken in private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is very choice. Thank you.\'94 \
\'93How did you get past my other guards?\'94 Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had been posted outside the tower, and Alyn on the stairs. \
\'93The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.\'94 Varys smiled apologetically. \'93I will not keep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. You are the King\'92s Hand, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the king is a fool.\'94 The eunuch\'92s cloying tones
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 were gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip. \'93Your friend, I know, yet a fool nonetheless . . . and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They had hoped to kill him during the melee.\'94 \
For a moment Ned was speechless with shock. \'93Who?\'94\
Varys sipped his wine. \'93If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert \
and I am on the wrong side.\'94 \
\'93The Lannisters,\'94 Ned said. \'93The queen . . . no, I will not believe that, not e
\f3 ven o
\f1 f Cersei. She asked him not to fight!\'94 \
\'93She forbade him to fight, in front of his bro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her, his knights, and half the court. Tell me truly, do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the melee? I ask you.\'94 \
Ned had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as as good as done. \'93Even if he\'92d fought, who would have dared to strike the king?\'94 \
Varys shrugged. \'93There were forty riders in the melee. The Lannisters have many friends. Am
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 dst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  his, who could na
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e it murder if some chance blow fell
\f3 ed H
\f1 is Grace?\'94 He went to the flagon and refilled his cup. \'93After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief. I can almost hear him weeping. So sad. Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor unfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King Joffrey
\f3  wo
\f1 uld have no choice but to pardon him.\'94 The eunuch stroked his cheek. \'93Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike off his head. Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 friend.\'94 \
Ned felt his anger rise. \'93You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.\'94 \
\'93I command whisperers, not warriors.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93You might have come to me earlier.\'94 \
\'93Oh, yes, I confess it. And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? And when Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done? I wonder.\'94 \
Ned considered that. \'93He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear them.\'94 \
Varys spread his hands. \'93I will ma
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e another confession, Lord Eddard. I was curious to see what you would do. Why not come 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord.\'94 \
\'93You did not trust me?\'94 Ned was frankly astonished. \
\'93The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,\'94 Varys said. \'93Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I could not say which you might be . . . so I waited to see . . . and now I know, for a certainty.\'94 He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ment his private face and public mask
\f3  were
\f1  one. \'93I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 so much. Oh, yes I do.\'94 \
\'93You are the one she ought to fea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 Ned said. \
\'93No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most puissant warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs. If a day should come when Cersei whispers, \'91Kill that man,\'92 Ilyn Payne will snick my head off i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then? Nor
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h or south, they sing no songs for spiders.\'94 He reached out and touched Ned with a soft hand. \'93But you, Lord Stark . . . I think . . . no, I know . . . he would not kill you, not eve
\f3 n fo
\f1 r his queen, and there may lie our salvation.\'94 \
It was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. \'93Surely Robert has other loyal friends,\'94 he protested. \'93His brothers, his\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97wife?\'94 Varys finished, with a smile that cut. \'93His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating the queen
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they? \
Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand Maester Pycelle loves his offi
\f3 ce, a
\f1 nd Littlefinger loves Littlefinger.\'94 \
\'93The Kingsguard\'97\'94 \
\'93A paper shield,\'94 the eunuch said. \'93Try 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot to look so shocked, Lord Stark. Jaime Lannister is h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1 \cf3 mself a S\cf2 wo\cf3 rn Brother of the \cf2 Wh\cf3 ite S
\f2 \cf2 w
\f1 \cf3 ords, and\cf2  w\cf3 e all know what hi\cf2 s \cf3 oath 
\f2 \cf2 i
\f0\b\fs38 s worth
\f2\b0\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The days when men like Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song. Of these seven, only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true steel, and Selmy is old. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen\'92s creatures to the bone, and I have deep suspicions of the others. No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 true friend Robert Baratheon will have.\'94 \
\'93Robert must be told,\'94 Ned said. \'93If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it for h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 mself.\'94 \
\'93And what proof shall we lay before him? My words against theirs? My l
\f3 itt
\f1 le birds
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 against the queen and the Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the War
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ens of East and West, against all the might of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, it will save us all some time. I know where that road ends.\'94 \
\'93Yet i
\f3 f what yo
\f1 u say is true, they will only bide their time
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and make another attempt.\'94 \
\'93Indeed they will,\'94 said Varys, \'93and sooner rather than later, I do fear. You are ma
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing them most anxious, Lord Eddard. But my little birds will be listening, and together we may b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  able to forestall them, you and I.\'94 He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more. \'93Thank you for the wine. We will speak again. When 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou see me next at council, be certain to treat me wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  your accustomed contempt. You should not find it difficult.\'94 \
He was at the door when Ned called, \'93Varys.\'94 The eunuch turned back. \'93How did Jon Arryn die?\'94 \
\'93I wondered when you would get around to that.\'94 \'93Tell me.\'94 \
\'93The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it leaves no trace. I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but he would not hear of i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . Only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me.\'94 \
Ned had to know the rest. \'93Who gave him the poison?\'94 \
\'93Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. Oh, but which one? There were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, 
\f3 trus
\f1 ting man.\'94 The eunuc
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  sighed. \'93There was one boy. All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King\'92s Landing and prospered. It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.\'94 The whip was in his voice again, every word a stroke. \'93He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  him in his bright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before you could talk to him . . . \'94 \
Ned felt half-poisone
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  himself. \'93The squire,\'94 he said. \'93Ser Hugh.\'94 Wheels within wheels within wheels. Ned\'92s head was pounding. \'93Why? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years. What was he doing that they had to kill him?\'94 \
\'93Asking questions,\'94 Varys said, slipping out the door. \

TYRION \
As he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse, Tyrion Lannister chalked up one more debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with never a wasted cut; the work had to be done quickly, before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights. \
\'93None of us will go hungry tonight,\'94 Bronn said. He was near a shadow himself; bone thin and bone hard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard. \
\'93Some of us may,\'94 Tyrion told him. \'93I am not fond of eating horse. Particularly my horse.\'94 \
\'93Meat is meat,\'94 Bronn said with a shrug. \'93The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork.\'94 \
\'93Do you take me for a Dothraki?\'94 Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n behind their khalasars. Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him. \
Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection. \'93Want a taste, dwarf?\'94 \
\'93My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,\'94 Tyrion said in a flat voice. \
\'93Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again.\'94 Chiggen grinned, showing yellow teeth, and swallowed the raw meat in two bites. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Tastes well bred.\'94 \
\'93Better if you fry it up with onions,\'94 Bronn put in. \
Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 old had settled deep in his bones, and hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  legs were so sore he could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food
\f3  and a short, 
\f1 cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. \'93Damn her,\'94 he muttered as he struggled up \
the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, \'93damn her and all the Starks.\'94 \
The memory was still bitter. One moment he\'92d been ordering supper, and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking, \'93No swords, not here, please, m\'92lords.\'94 \
Tyrion wrenched down Jyck\'92s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked to pieces. \'93Where are your courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do as she asks.\'94 He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt. \'93You\'92re making a sad mistake, Lady St
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rk. I had no part in any attack on your son. On my honor\'97\'94 \
\'93Lannister honor,\'94 was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to see. \'93His dagger left these scars. The blade he sent to open my son\'92s throat.\'94 \
Tyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman\'92s hands. \'93Kill him,\'94 hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other voices took up the call, faster than he would have believed. Strangers all, friendly enoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail. \
Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. \'93If Lady Stark believes I have some crime to answe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  for, I will go with her and answer for i
\f3 t.\'94 
\f1 \
It was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman\'92s plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though they\'92d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing. Against that, what did Tyrion have? A dagger at his belt, and two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; he was part groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings might have been, the black brothers we
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yoren would do nothing. \
And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark\'92s side said, \'93Take their weapons,\'94 and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck\'92s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers. \'93Good,\'94 the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably, \'93excellent.\'94 Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell\'92s master-at-arms, s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 orn of his whiskers. \
Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep\'92s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark, \'93Don\'92t kill him here!\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t kill him anywhere,\'94 Tyrion urged. \
\'93Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m\'92lady, I wants no high lordlin\'92s quarrels.\'94 \
\'93We are taking him back to Winterfell,\'94 she said, and Tyrion thought, Well,\
perhaps . . . By then he\'92d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation. He was not altogether displeased by what he saw. Oh, the Stark woman had been clever
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  no doubt of it. Force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked. There were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count. Catelyn Stark\'92s plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, and they\'92d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move. He might have smiled if he\'92d dared. \
\'93Winterfell it is, then,\'94 he said instead. That was a long ride, as h
\f3 e could well attest, having just ridden it the other way. So many things could happen along the way. \'93My f
\f1 ather will wonder what has become of me,\'94 he added, catching the eye of the swordsman who\'92d offered to yield up his room. \'93He\'92ll pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today.\'94 Lord Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free. \
Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. \'93His men co
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e with him,\'94 the old knight announced. \'93And we\'92ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you\'92ve seen here.\'94 \
It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone. The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow. If not him, then someone else. Yoren would carry the story south. That fool singer might make a lay of it. The Freys would report back to their
\f3  lord, a
\f1 nd the gods only knew what he might do. Lord Wa
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 der Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. At the very least he would send his b
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rds winging south to King\'92s Landing, and he might well dare more than that. \
Catelyn Stark wasted no time. \'93We must ride at once. We\'92ll want fresh mounts, and provisions for the road. You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark. If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to Winter
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ell, I promise you shall be well rewarded.\'94 That was all it took; the fools came rushing forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be well rewarded, he vowed to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined. \
Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that. Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was congratulat
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle. \
They set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion\'92s thighs were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot, it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by his blindness. Every twist a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d turn put him in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he could not make out what was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on. I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that wretched singer had to open his mouth, he thought mournfully. The wretched singer had come along with them. \'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ere is a great song to be made from this, and I\'92m the one to make it,\'94 he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the \'93splendid adventure\'94 turned out. Tyrion wondered whether the boy wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders caught up with them. \
The r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 in had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  hood off his head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out of him in a rush. \'93This is the high road,\'94 he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. \'93The eastern road. You said we were riding for Winterfell!\'94 \
Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. \'93Often and loudly,\'94 she agreed. \'93No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good speed.\'94 \
Even now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion had prided himse
\f3 lf o
\f1 n his
\f3  cunn
\f1 ing,
\f3  the 
\f1 only gift the gods had seen fit to give h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m, and yet this seven-times-damned she-
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 olf Catelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction. \
They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off again. This time Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night they no longer \
bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. And why should they? Up here the land was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a stony track. If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would make a morsel of
\f3  h
\f1 im, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword. \
Yet still the Stark woman drove th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m forward relentlessly. He knew wh
\f3 ere
\f1  they were bound. He had known it since the mo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ent they pulled off his hood. These mountains were the domain of House Arryn, and the late Hand\'92s widow was a Tully, Catelyn Stark\'92s sister . . . and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion had known the Lady Lysa slightly during her year
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  at King\'92s Landing, and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance. \
His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. The horses had drunk the
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of wh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t the damp was doing to his strings. \
\'93We must have some rest, my lady,\'94 the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as Ty
\f3 rion
\f1  approached. He was Lady Whent\'92s man, st
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ff-necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn. \
\'93Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,\'94 Ser Rodrik said. \'93This is the third horse we have lost \'97\'94 \
\'93We will l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 s
\f3 e more than ho
\f1 rses if we\'92re overtake
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  by the Lannisters,\'94 she reminded them. Her face w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s windburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its determination. \
\'93Small chance of that here,\'94 Tyrion put in. \
\'93The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,\'94 snapped Kurleket, a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 great fat oaf with short- cropped hair and a pig\'92s face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld his friends Lharys and Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp les
\f3 son f
\f1 or Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage. \
\'93Let him speak,\'94 Lady Stark commanded. \
Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. \'93By now our pursuit is likely racing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 across the Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroad . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . assuming there is a pursuit, which is 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 y no means certain. Oh, no doubt the word has r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ached my father . . . but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he will both
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r to bestir himself.\'94 It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or his deformed son, but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. \'93This is a 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ruel land, Lady Stark. You\'92ll find no succor unti
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  
\f3 you rea
\f1 ch
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more. Worse, you risk losing me. I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what\'92s the poin
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 That was no lie at all; Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace. \
\'93It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,\'94 Catelyn Stark replied. \
\'93I th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nk not,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one of these
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile.\'94 He looked at Kurleket, but the man was too dim to taste the mockery. \
\'93The Starks do not murder men in their beds.\'94\
\'93Nor do I,\'94 he said. \'93I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your son.\'94 \'93The assassin was armed with you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  
\f3 dagger.\'94 \
T
\f1 yrion felt the heat rise in him. \'93It was not my dagger,\'94 he insisted. \'93How many times must I swear to that? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a commo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  footpad with his own blade.\'94 \
Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what she said was, \'93Why would Petyr lie to me?\'94 \
\'93Why does a bear shit in the woods?\'94 he demanded. \'93Because it is his nature. Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger. You ought to know that, you of all people.\'94 \
She took a step toward him, her face tight. \'93And what does that mean, Lannister
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Tyrion cocked his head. \'93Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my lady.\'94 \
\'93That is a lie!\'94 Catelyn Stark said. \
\'93Oh, wicked little imp,\'94 Marillion said, shocked. \
Kurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. \'93At your word, m\'92lady, I\'92ll toss his lying tongue at your feet.\'94 His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect. \
Catelyn Stark stared 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen. \'93Petyr Baelish loved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and nothing t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter. You are truly an
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 evil man, Lannister.\'94 \
\'93And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it\'92s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.\'94 \
Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, baring his throat. Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. \'93Shall I bleed him, my lady?\'94 \
\'93Kill me and the truth dies with me,\'94 Tyrion gasped. \
\'93Let 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im talk,\'94 Catelyn Stark commanded. \
Kurleket let go of Tyrion\'92s hair, reluctantly. \
Tyrion took a deep breath. \'93How did Littlefinger tell you I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 came by this dagger of his? Answer me that.\'94 \
\'93You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey\'92s name day.\'94 \
\'93When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?\'94 \
\'93It was,\'94 she admitted. A line creased her brow. \
\'93Riders!\'94 \
The shriek came fr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 m the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser Rodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest. \
For a long second, no one moved.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Catelyn Stark was the first to react. \'93Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to horse,\'94 she shouted. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, guard the prisoners\'97\'94 \
\'93Arm us!\'94 Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. \'93You will need every sword.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 he knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn herself; she was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated. \
\'93I hear them!\'94 Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was: hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  their mounts. \
Peb
\f3 bles rained
\f1  down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge. He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap. \'93Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,\'94 he said, breathless. \'93Milk Snakes or Moon Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 \'92lady . . . hidden watchers . . . they know we\'92re here.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched behind a boulder, both hands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth. \'93You, singer,\'94 Ser Willis Wode called out. \'93Help me with this breastplate.\'94 Marillion sat frozen, clutching his woodharp, his face as pale as milk, but Tyrion\'92s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor. \
Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark. \'93You have no choice,\'94 he told her. \'93Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us . . . four men can be the di
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ference between life and death up here.\'94 \
\'93Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.\'94 \
\'93My word?\'94 The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly. \'93Oh, that you have, my lady . . . on my honor as a Lannister.\'94 \
For a moment he thought she wo
\f3 uld s
\f1 pit at him, but instead she snapped, \'93Arm them,\'94 and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road. He was a better archer than swordsman. And Bronn rode up
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe. \
\'93I have never fought with an axe.\'94 The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n his hands. It had a short haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top. \
\'93Pretend you\'92re splitting logs,\'94 Bronn said, drawing his longsword from th
\f3 e scabba
\f1 rd 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 cross his back. He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume. \
\'93Logs don\'92t bleed,\'94 Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He looked around for a rock and ran over 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o where Marillion was hiding. \'93Move over.\'94 \
\'93Go away!\'94 the boy screamed back at him. \'93I\'92m a singer, I want no part of this fight!\'94 \
\'93What, lost your taste for adventure?\'94 Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them. \
There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred halfhelms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed greatsword. \
Ser Rodrik shouted \'93Winterfell!\'94 and rode to meet him,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head. \'93Harrenhal! Harrenhal!\'94 he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out, \'93Casterly Rock!\'94 but
\f3  the insanity passed qu
\f1 ickly and he crouc
\f3 hed down lower. \

\f1 He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen\'92s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansm
\f3 en like a whirl
\f1 wind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he shadowskin cloak. When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else. \
Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the r
\f3 ider t
\f1 urned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortun
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 te. Horse and rider crashed to the groun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  in a tangle on top of the singer.
\f3  Ty
\f1 rion danced back in while the brigand\'92s leg \
was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, and buried the axe in the man\'92s neck, just a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ove the shoulder blades. \
As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies. \'93Someone help me,\'94 the singer gasped. \'93Gods have mercy, I\'92m
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 bleeding.\'94 \
\'93I believe that\'92s horse blood,\'94 Tyrion said. The singer\'92s hand came crawling ou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  from beneath the dead animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch. \'93Close your eyes a
\f3 nd pretend you\'92
\f1 re
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dead,\'94 he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away. \
After that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand. Tyrion kept
\f3  on the
\f1  fringes of the fight, sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a wounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man\'92s halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him, and later Tyrion stumbled over
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Kurleket\'92s body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but Tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man\'92s dead fingers. He was sliding it t
\f3 hrough his belt w
\f1 hen he heard a wom
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n\'92s scream. \
Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her, one still mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion thought, and welcome to 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the back of the knee before they even kn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. Logs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward . . . and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im and opened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly. \
Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the fighting had ended when he wasn\'92t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all around, screaming or moaning. To his vast as
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 onishment, he was not one of them. He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His hands were sticky with blo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 d. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all. \
\'93Your first battle?\'94 Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck\'92s body, pulling off his boots. They were good boots, as befit one of Lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Tywin\'92s men; heavy leather, oiled and supple, \
much finer than what Bronn was wearing. \
Tyrion nodded. \'93My father will be so proud,\'94 he said. His legs w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re cramping so badly he could scarcely stand. Odd, he 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad never once noticed the pain during the battle. \
\'93You need a woman now,\'94 Bronn said with a glint in his black ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s. He shoved the boots into his saddlebag. \'93Nothing like a woman after a man\'92s been blooded, take my word.\'94 \
Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips. \
Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik\'92s wounds. \'93I\'92m willing if she is,\'94 he said. The freeride
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought, There\'92s a start. \
Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice. As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses scrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a scythe . . . He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rod
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on the stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small w
\f3 onder 
\f1 the clansmen had left nine bodie
\f3 s on 
\f1 the ground. \
They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken\'92s men-at-arms, Kurleket an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Mohor, and his own man Jyck, who had made such a 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 old show with his bareback charge. A fool to the end, Tyrion thought. \
\'93Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,\'94 Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes scanning the ridgetops waril
\f3 y thro
\f1 ugh the slit in his helm
\f2\fs24 .
\f1 \cf3  \'93We drov\cf2 e \cf3 them off for the m\cf2 om\cf3 ent, 
\f2 \cf2 b
\f1 \cf3 ut they w\cf2 il\cf3 l not have gone fa\cf2 r.\cf3 \'94 \
\'93
\f2 \cf2 W
\f0\b\fs38 e mus
\f2\b0\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  bury our dead, Ser Willis,\'94 she said. \'93These were brave me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 . I will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats.\'94 \
\'93This soil is too stony for digging,\'94 Ser Willis said. \
\'93Then we shall gather stones fo
\f3 r cairns.\'94 \
\'93Gat
\f1 her all the stones y
\f3 ou want,\'94 Bronn to
\f1 ld her, \'93but do it without me or Chiggen. I\'92ve
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 better things to do than pile rocks on dead men . . . breathing, for one.\'94 He looked over \
the rest of the survivors. \'93Any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.\'94 \
\'93My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,\'94 Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. \'93If we linger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.\'94 \
Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn\'92s face, but she had no 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hoice. \'93May the g
\f3 ods f
\f1 orgive us, then. We will ride at once.\'94 \
There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck\'92s spotted gelding, who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said, \'93I\'92ll take that dirk now, dwarf.\'94 \
\'93Let him keep it.\'94 Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. \'93And see that he has his axe back as well. We may have need of it if we are attacked again.\'94 \
\'93You have my thanks, lady,\'94 Tyrion said, mounting up. \
\'93Save them,\'94 she said curtly. \'93I trust you no more than I did before.\'94 She was gone before he could frame a reply. \
Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he had begun the journey, with hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself ahead in the game. \
Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired 
\f3 a magnificent sha
\f1 dowskin cloak, thick black fur sl
\f3 ashed by stripes o
\f1 f 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hite. He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say. \
They heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the wild snarling 
\f3 of the beasts fi
\f1 ghting over the corpses they had left behind. Marillion grew visibly pale. Tyrion trotted up beside him. \'93Craven,\'94 he said, \'93rhymes nicely with raven.\'94 He kicked his horse and moved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark. \
She looked at him, lips pressed tightly together. \
\'93As I was saying before we w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re so rudely interrupted,\'94 Tyri
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n began, \'93there is a serious flaw in Littlefinger\'92s fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you this\'97I never bet against my family.\'94 \

ARYA \
The one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her. \
Arya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls
\f3  of her bare feet, listening to the
\f1  flutter of her heart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself, light as a feather. The tomcat watched her come, h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s eyes wary. \
Catching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in tumbles. At first even the cook\'92s huge fa
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28  kitchen cat had b
\f1 een able to elude
\f3  her, but Syrio had kept her at
\f1  it day and night. When she\'92d run to him with her hands bleeding, he had said, \'93So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than scratches.\'94 He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats. \
The Red Ke
\f3 ep was fu
\f1 ll of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, cold-eyed mousers twitching their tails, quick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies\'92 cats all combed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and trusting, ragged shadows prowling the midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them u
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  and brought them proudly to Syrio Forel . . . all but this one, this one-eared black devil 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f a tomcat. \'93That\'92s the real king of this castle right there,\'94 one of the gold cloaks had told her.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, the king was feasting the queen\'92s father, and that blac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of Lord Tywin\'92s fingers. 
\f2\fs24 R
\f1\fs28 obert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child.\'94 \
He had run her halfway
\f3  across the castle;
\f1  twice around the Tower 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the Hand, across the inner bailey, th
\f3 rough the stable
\f1 s, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barr
\f3 acks of the gold cloa
\f1 ks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and for
\f3 th over Traitor
\f1 \'92s Walk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until Arya didn\'92t know where she was. \
Now at last she had him. High walls pressed close on 
\f3 eit
\f1 her side, and ahead was a blank windowless mass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed, sliding forward, light as a feather. \
When she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went; and right, then left, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs. Quick as a snake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She hugged him to her chest, whirling and
\f3  laughing aloud as
\f1  his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the eyes, and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat yowled and spit. \
\'93What\'92s he doing to that cat?\'94 \
Startled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The tom bounded off in the blink of 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n eye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as pretty as a doll in blue satin. Beside her was a plump little blond b
\f3 oy with a pranc
\f1 in
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa as large as a draft 
\f3 horse hovered ove
\f1 r them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister house guards. \
\'93What were you doing to that cat, boy?\'94 Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, \'93He\'92s a ragged boy, isn\'92t he? Look at him.\'94 She giggled. \
\'93A ragged dirty smelly boy,\'94 Tommen agreed. \
They don\'92t know me, Arya realized. They don\'92t even know I\'92m a girl. Small wonder; she was barefoot and dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees. You don\'92t wear skirts and silks when you\'92re catching cats. Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn\'92t recognize her. If they did, she would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane would be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shame. \
The old fat septa moved forward. \'93Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in this part of the castle.\'94 \
\'93You can\'92t keep this sort out,\'94 one of the red clo
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ks said. \'93Like trying to keep out rats.\'94 \
\'93Who do you belong to,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 boy?\'94 the septa demanded. \'93Answer me. What\'92s wrong with you, are you mute?\'94 \
Arya\'92s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain. \
\'93Godwyn, bring him here,\'94 the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley. \
Panic gripped her throat like a giant\'92s hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it. Calm as still water, she mouthed silently. \
As Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her l
\f3 eft, letting his fi
\f1 ngers brush her arm,
\f3  spinning around him. Smooth as summer 
\f1 silk. By the time he got hims
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lf turned, she was sprinting down the alley. Swift as 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  deer. The septa was screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns, bounded to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped ov
\f3 er hi
\f1 m when he sat down hard and said \'93Oof,\'94 spun away from the second guard, and then she was past them all, running full out. \
She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 hind her. She dropped and rolled. The red cloak went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw a window above her, high and narrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her breath as she wriggled through. Slippery as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and along a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant behind her. \
Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had recognized her, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut she didn\'92t think they had. She\'92d moved too fast. Swift as a deer. \
She hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the 
\f3 pursui
\f1 t, but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself. She wondered where she
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was. When they had first come to King\'92s Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting lost
\f3  in the castle. Fat
\f1 her said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending 
\f3 endless circular stairs, darting throug
\f1 h courtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood, and no
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 here could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father\'92s voice, but always from 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and 
\f3 fainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark. \
It was very dark right now, sh
\f1 e realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would \
be safe for her to come creeping back out and find h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r way home. \
By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the blackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Wou
\f3 ld never h
\f1 ave been. She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whisperin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  in her ear. Calm as still water, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes again. \
The monsters were still there, but the fear was gone. \
Arya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one, curious, wondering if it was r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 al. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real enough. The bone was smooth beneath her hand, 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 old and hard to the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of darkness. It made
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her shiver. \
\'93It\'92s dead,\'94 she said aloud. \'93It\'92s just a skull, it can\'92t hurt me.\'94 Yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger than the first. For a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted a
\f3  bi
\f1 te of her flesh. Arya whirle
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  jerkin, and then she was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against the door. \
Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door resisted a moment, before it slowly 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 egan to swing inward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the door just far enough to slip through, into the hallway b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 yond. \
If the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. Calm as still water, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, felt the air move, saw nothing. She was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded herself. She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out with her hands. \
Her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her \
hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hrough the darkness. All halls lead somewhere. Where there is a way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper 
\f3 than swords. A
\f1 rya would not be afra
\f3 id. It seemed as 
\f1 if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek. Loose ha
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rs stirred faintly against her skin. \
From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound of voices. A flickering light
\f3  brus
\f1 hed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And something was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the e
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rth . . . \
Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw the light of a single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their shadows writhed against the sides of the well, tall as giants. She could hear their voices, echoing up the shaft. \
\'93 . . . found one bastard,\'94 one said. \'93The rest will come soon. A day, two days, a fortnight . . . \'94 \
\'93And when he learns the truth, what will he do?\'94 a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the Free Cities. \
\'93The gods alone know,\'94 the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. \'93The fools tried to kill his son, and what\'92s worse, they made a mummer\'92s farce of it. He\'92s not a man to put that aside. I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other\'92s throats, whether we will it or no.\'94 \
\'93Too soon, too soon,\'94 the voice with the accent complained. \'93What good is war now
\f3 ? We 
\f1 are not rea
\f3 dy. Delay.
\f1 \'94 \
\'93As well bid me stop time. Do you take me for a wizard?\'94 \
The other chuckled. \'93No l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ss.\'94 Flames licked at the cold air. The tall shadows were almost on top of her. An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, his companion beside him. Arya crept back away from the well, drop
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ed to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall. She held her breath as the men reached the top 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the steps. \
\'93What would you have me do?\'94 asked the torchbearer,
\f3  a stout man in a
\f1  l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ather half cape. Even in heavy boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round \
scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail over bo
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 led leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about him. \
\'93If one Ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d can die, why not a second?\'94 replied the man with the accent and the forked yellow beard. \'93You have danced the dance before, my friend.\'94 He was no one Arya had ever seen before, she was certain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might. His rings glimmered in the torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, sapphires, slitted yellow tiger eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had tw
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 . \
\'93Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,\'94 the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall. Still as stone, Arya told herself, quiet as a shadow. Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did not see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away. \
\'93Perhaps so,\'94 the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb. \'93Nonetheless, we must have time. The princess is with child. The khal wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l not bestir himself until his son is born. You know how they are, these savages.\'94 \
The man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A huge slab of rock, red in the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out. Where the entry to the well had been was nothing but stone, solid and unbroken. \
\'93If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,\'94 the stout man in the steel 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ap said. \'93This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ew queen. Littlefinger . . . the gods only know what game Littlefinge
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  is playing. Yet Lord Stark\'92s the one who tro
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 bles my s
\f3 leep. He has
\f1  the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he\'92ll hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  the truth. And now his wif
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger\'92s meddling. Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, and Jaim
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  has a queer affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well. Delay, yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  say. Make haste, I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever.\'94 \
\'93You are more than a juggler, old friend. You are a true sorcerer. All I ask is that you work your magic awhile longer.\'94 They started down the hall in the direction Arya had come, past the room with the monsters. \
\'93What I can do, I will,\'94 the one with the torch said softly. \'93I must have gold, and another fifty birds.\'94 \
She let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them. Quiet as a shadow. \
\'93So many?\'94 The voices were fainte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  as the light dwindled ahead of her. \'93The ones you need are hard to find . . . so young, to know their letters . . . perhaps older . . . not die so easy . . . \'94 \
\'93No. The younger are safer . . . treat them gently . . . \'94 \'93 . . . .if they kept their tongues . . . \'94\
\'93 . . . the risk . . . \'94 \
Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 orch, a smoking star that bid her follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight, and both times she found herself at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering far below h
\f3 er. S
\f1 he hurried after it, down and down. Once she stumbled over a ro
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k and fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth supported by timbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone. \
She must have crept after them for miles. Finally they were gone, but there was no place to go but forward. She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that
\f3  Nymeria
\f1  was padding along beside her in the darkness. At the end she was knee-deep in foul-smelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as Syrio might have, and wondering if she\'92d ever see light again. It was full dark when finally Arya emerged into the nig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t air. \
She found herself standing at the mouth of a se
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 r whe
\f1 re it emptied into the river. She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the river road as Arya was washing her clothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in the moonlight, they took no notice. \
She was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King\'92s Landing you needed only to look up to see the Red Keep high on Aegon\'92s Hill, so there was no danger of losing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her way. Her clothes were almost dry by the time she reached the gatehouse. The portcullis was down and the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ates barred, so she turned aside to a postern doo
\f3 r. Th
\f1 e gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he told them to let her in. \'93Off with you,\'94 one said. \
\'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  kitche
\f3 n scr
\f1 aps are gone, and we\'92ll have no begging after dark.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not a beggar,\'94 she said. \'93I live here.\'94 \
\'93I said, off with you. Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?\'94 \
\'93I
\f3  want t
\f1 o see my father.\'94 \
The guards exchanged a glance. \'93I want to fuck the queen myself, for 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll the goo
\f3 d it
\f1  does me,\'94 the younger one said. \
The older scowled. \'93Who\'92s this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?\'94 \'93The Hand of the King,\'94 Arya 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 old him. \
Both men laughed, b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t then the older one swung his fist at her, casually, as a man would swat a dog. Arya saw the blow coming even before it began. She danced back out of the way, untouched. \'93I\'92m not a boy,\'94 she spat at them. \'93I\'92m Arya Stark of Winterfell, and if you lay a ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d on me my lord father will have both your heads on s
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ikes. If you don\'92t believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of the Hand.\'94 She put her hands on her hips. \'93Now are you going to open the gate, or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?\'94 \
Her father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched her in, an oil l
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 mp glowing softly at his elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya had ever seen, a great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script, bound between faded 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eather covers, but he closed it to listen to Harwin\'92s report. His face was stern as he sent the men away with thanks. \
\'93Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u realize I had half my guard out searching for you?\'94 Eddard Stark said when they were alone. \'93Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear. She\'92s in the sept
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 praying for your safe return. Arya, you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave.\'94 \
\'93I didn\'92t 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 o out t
\f3 he g
\f1 ates,\'94 she blurted. \'93Well, I didn\'92t mean to. I was down in the dungeons, only they turned into this tunnel. It was all dark, and I didn\'92t have a torch or a candle to see by, so I had to follow. I couldn\'92t go back the way I came on account of the monsters. Father, they were talking about killing you! Not the monsters, the two men. They didn\'92t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard them. They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die, why not a second? Is that the book? Jon\'92s the bastard, I bet.\'94 \
\'93Jon? Arya, what are you t
\f3 alkin
\f1 g about? Who said this?\'94 \
\'93They did,\'94 she told him. \'93There was a fat one with rings and a forked yell
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w beard, and another in mail and a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he couldn\'92t keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were go
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng to ea
\f3 t eac
\f1 h other and it was a mummer\'92s farce.\'94 She tried to remember the rest. She hadn\'92t quite understood everything she\'92d heard, and now it was all mixed up in her head. \'93The fat one said the princess was with child. The one in the steel cap, he had the torch, he said that they had to hurry. I think he was a wizard.\'94 \
\'93A wizard,\'94 said Ned, unsmiling. \'93Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars?\'94 \
\'93No! It wasn\'92t like Old Nan\'92s stories. H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  didn\'92t look l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ke a wizard, but the fat one said he was.\'94 \
\'93I warn you, Arya, if you\'92re spinning this thread of air\'97\'94 \
\'93No, I told you, it was in the dungeons, by the place with the secret wall. I was chasing cats, and well . . . \'94 She screwed up her face. If she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen, he would be really angry with her. \'93 . . . well, I went in this window. That\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 where I found the monsters.\'94 \
\'93Monsters and wizards,\'94 her father said. \'93It would seem you\'92ve had quite an adventu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e. These men you heard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Arya admitted, \'93only\'97\'94 \
\'93Arya, they were mu
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 mers,\'94 her father told her. \'93There must be a dozen troupes in King\'92s Landing right now, come to make some co
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n off the tourney crowds. I\'92m not certain what these two were doing in the castle, but perhaps the king has asked f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r a show.\'94 \
\'93No.\'94 She shook her head stubbornly. \'93They weren\'92t\'97\'94 \
\'93You 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 houldn\'92t be following people about and spying on them in any case. Nor do I cherish the notion of my daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats. Look at you, sweetling. Your arms are covered with scratches. This has gone on long enough. Tell Syrio Forel that I want a word with hirn\'97\'94 \
He was i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 terrupted by a short, sudden knock. \'93Lord Eddard, pardons,\'94 Desmond called out, opening the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 door a crack, \'93but there\'92s a black brother here begging audience. He \
says the matter is urgent. I thought you wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d want to know.\'94 \'93My door is always open to the Night\'92s Watch
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Father said. \
Desmond ushered the man inside. He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt beard a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d unwashed clothes, yet Father greeted hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  pleasantly and asked his name. \
\'93Yoren, as it please m\'92lord. My pardons for the hour.\'94 He bowed to Arya. \'93And this must be yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1 \cf3 r son. He\cf2  h\cf3 as your look.\'94 \
\'93\cf2 I\'92\cf3 m a g
\f2 \cf2 i
\f1 \cf3 rl,\'94 Arya\cf2  s\cf3 aid, exasperated. \cf2 If\cf3  the 
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38 ld man 
\f2\b0\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as down from the Wall, he must have come by way of Winterfell. \'93Do you know my brothers?\'94 she asked ex
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 i
\f3 tedly. \'93Robb and Bran 
\f1 are at Winterfell, and Jon\'92s on the Wall. Jon Snow, he\'92s in the Night\'92s Watch too, you must know him, he has a direwolf, a white one with red eyes. Is Jon a ranger yet? I\'92m Arya Stark.\'94 The old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at her oddly, but Arya could not seem to stop talking. \'93When you ride back 
\f3 to the Wall, wou
\f1 ld 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?\'94 She wished Jon were here right now. He\'92d believe her about the dungeons and the fat man with the forked beard and the wizard in the steel cap. \
\'93My daughter often forgets her courtesies,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that softened his words. \'93I beg your forgiveness, Yoren. Did my brother Benjen send you?\'94 \
\'93No one sent me, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 \'92lord, saving old Mormont. I\'92m here to find men for the Wall, and when Robert next holds court, I\'92ll bend the knee an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  
\f3 cry
\f1  our need, see if the king and his Hand have some scum in the dungeons they\'92d be well rid of. You might say as Benjen Sta
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k is why we\'92re talking, though. His blood ran black. Made him my brother as much as yours. It\'92s for his sake I\'92m come. Rode hard, I did, near killed my horse 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he way I drove her, but I left the others well behind.\'94 \
\'93The others?\'94 \
Yoren spat. \'93Sellswords and freeriders and li
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e trash. That inn was full o\'92 them, and I saw them take the scent. The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they smell the same in the end. Not all o\'92 them made for King\'92s Landing, either. Some went ga
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 loping for 
\f3 Cas
\f1 terly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have gotten the word by now, you can count on it.\'94 \
Father frowned. \'93What 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ord is this?\'94\
Yoren eyed Arya.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93One best spoken in private, m\'92lord, begging your pardons.\'94 \
\'93As you say. Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers.\'94 He kissed her on the brow. \'93We\'92ll finish our talk on the morrow.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 rya stood rooted to the spot. \'93Nothing bad\'92s happened to Jon, has it?\'94 she asked Yoren. \'93Or Uncle Benjen?\'94 \
\'93Well,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 s to S
\f1 tark, I can\'92t say. The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall. It\'92s not them as concerns me.\'94 \
Desmond took her hand. \'93Come along, milady. You heard your lord father.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 rya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With Tom, she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too single-minded to trick. \'93How many gu
\f3 ards 
\f1 does my father have?\'94 she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber. \
\'93Here at King\'92s Landing? Fifty.\'94\
\'93You wouldn\'92t let anyone kill him, would you?\'94 she asked. \
Desmond laughed. \'93No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddard\'92s guarded night and day. He\'92ll come to no harm.\'94 \
\'93The Lannister
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  have more than fifty men,\'94 Arya pointed out. \
\'93So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep easy.\'94 \
\'93What if a wizard was sent to kill him?\'94 \
\'93Well, as to that,\'94 Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, \'93wizards die the same as other men, once you cut their heads off.\'94 \

EDDARD \
Robert, I beg of you,\'94 Ned pleaded, \'93hear what you are
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 saying. You are talking of murdering a child.\'94 \
\'93The whore is pregnant!\'94 The king\'92s fist slammed down on the council ta
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 le loud as a thunderclap. \'93I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you\'92ll hear it now. I want them dead, mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  for you? I want t
\f3 hem dead.\'94
\f1  \
The other councill
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rs were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else. No doubt they were wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone. \'93You will dishonor yourself forever i
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  you do this.\'94 \
\'93Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 dow of the axe when it is hanging over my o
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n
\f3  neck.\'94
\f1  \
\'93There is no axe,\'94 Ned told his king. \'93Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years removed . . . 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 f it exists at all.\'94 \
\'93If?\'94 Varys asked softly, wringing powdered hands together. \'93My lord, you wrong
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me. Would I bring ties to king and council?\'94 \
Ned looked at the eunuch coldly. \'93You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away, my lord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying.\'94 \
\'93Ser Jorah would not dare
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 deceive me,\'94 Varys said with a sly smile. \'93Rely on it, my lord. The princess is with child.\'94 \
\'93So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we need not fear. If she births a daughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe dies in infancy, we need not fear.\'94 \
\'93But if it is a boy?\'94 Robert insisted. \'93If he lives?\'94\
\'93The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach \
their horses to run on water.\'94 \
The king took a swallow of wine and glowered 
\f3 at Ned
\f1  across the council table. \'93So you would counsel me to do nothing until the drag
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nspawn has landed his army on my shores, is that it?\'94 \
\'93This \'91dragonspawn\'92 is in his mother\'92s belly,\'94 Ned said. \'93Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Gods! You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark.\'94 The king looked around the council table. \'93Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to this frozen- faced fool?\'94 \
Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned\'92s sleeve. \'93I under
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 and your 
\f1 qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this grie
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ous news to council. It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, howevermuch it p
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ins us.\'94 \
Lord Renly shrugged. \'93The matter seems simple en
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ugh to me. We ought to have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.\'94 \
\'93Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,\'94 Ned replied. \'93On the Tri
\f3 dent, Se
\f1 r Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert\'92s friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his th
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 oat, but your brother said, \'91I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,\'92 an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan\'92s wounds
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 He gave the king a long cool look. \'93Would that man were here today.\'94 \
Robert had shame enough to blush. \'93It was not the same,\'94 he complained. \'93Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard.\'94 \
\'93Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.\'94 Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. \'93Robe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 , I 
\f1 ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?\'94 \
\'93To put an end to Targaryens!\'94 the king growled. \
\'93Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar.\'94 Ned fought to keep the scorn out of his voice, and failed. \'93Have the years so unmanned you that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?\'94 \
Robert purpled. \'93No more, Ned,\'94 he warned, poin
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ing. \'93Not another word. Have you forgotten who is king here?\'94 \
\'93No, Your Grace,\'94 Ned replied. \'93Have you?\'94 \
\'93Enough!\'94 the king bellowed. \'93I am sick of talk. I\'92ll be done with this, or be damned. What say you all?\'94 \
\'93She must be killed,\'94 Lord Renly declared.\
\'93We have no choice,\'94 murmured Varys. \'93Sadly, sadly . . . \'94 \
Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s from the table and said, \'93Your Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother\'92s womb. Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard.\'94 \
Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes. \'93My order serves the realm, not the ruler. Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I counse
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  King Robert now, so I bear
\f3  th
\f1 is girl child of his no ill will. Yet I ask you this\'97 should war come again, how many soldiers will die? How many towns will burn? How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear?\'94 He 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 troked his luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary. \'93Is it not wiser, even kinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Kinder,\'94 Varys said. \'93Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. Should the go
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s in their caprice grant D
\f3 aenerys
\f1  Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed.\'94 \
Littlefinger was the last. As Ned looked to him, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. \'93When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, the best thing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to do is close your eyes and get on with it,\'94 he declared. \'93Waiting won\'92t make the maid any prettier. Kiss her and be done with it.\'94 \
\'93Kiss her?\'94 Ser Barristan repeated, aghast. \'93A steel kiss,\'94 said Littlefinger. \
Robert turned to face his Hand. \'93Well,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand alone on this matter. The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?\'94 \
\'93Mormont craves a royal pardon,\'94 Lord Renly reminded them. \
\'93Desperately,\'94 Varys said, \'93yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess nears Vaes Dothrak, where it is death to draw a blade. If 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used one on a khaleesi, none of you would sle
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p tonight.\'94 He stroked a powdered cheek. \'93Now, poison . . . the tears of Lys, let us say. Khal Drogo need never know
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it was not a natural death.\'94 \
Grand Maester Pycelle\'92s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at the eunuch. \
\'93Poison is a coward\'92s weapon,\'94 the king complained. \
Ned had heard enough. \'93You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl and still quibble about honor?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f3\fs28  He push
\f1 ed back his chair and stood. \'93Do it yourself, Robert. The man who passe
\f3 s the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the e
\f1 yes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much at least.\'94 \
\'93Gods,\'94 the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury. \'93You mean it, damn you.\'94 He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow, found it empty, and flung it away to shatter against the wall. \'93I am out of wine and out of patience. Enough of th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s. Just have it done.\'94 \
\'93I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to it.\'94 \
For a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. Defiance was not a dish he tasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension came. His eyes narrowed and a flush crept 
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 p his neck past the velvet 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ollar. He pointed an angry finger at Ned. \'93You are the King\'92s Hand, Lord Stark. You will do as I command you, or I\'92ll find me a Hand who will.\'94 \
\'93I wish him every success.\'94 Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of his cloak, the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it on the table in front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him, the friend he had loved. \'93I tho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ght you a better man than this, Robert. I thought we had made a nobler king.\'94 \
Robert\'92s face was purple. \'93Out,\'94 he croaked, choking on his rage. \'93Out, damn you, I\'92m done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, I\'92ll have your head on a spike!\'94 \
Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert\'92s eyes on his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely \
a pause. \'93On Braavos there is a society calle
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the Faceless Men,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle offered. \
\'93Do you have any idea how costly they are?\'94 Littlefinger complained. \'93You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that\'92s for a merchant. I don\'92t dare think what they might ask for a princess.\'94 \
The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was stationed outside the chamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard. He gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of his eye, but asked no questions. \
The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the Hand. He could
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 feel the threat of rain in the air. Ned would have welcomed it. It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he
\f1  summoned Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. \'93You sent for me, my lord Hand?\'94 \
\'93Hand no longer,\'94 Ned told him. \'93The king and I have quarreled. We shall be returning to Winterfell.\'94 \
\'93I shall begin making arrangeme
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ts at 
\f3 once, m
\f1 y lord. We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey.\'94 \
\'93We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned something about seeing my he
\f3 ad on a spike.\'94 
\f1 Ned frowned. He 
\f3 did not truly believe the kin
\f1 g would harm him, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, his rage would cool as it always did. \
Always? S
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever. It was a disturbing\
notion . . . and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light so
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n, as sure as sunrise, and with the king in such a black fury . . . Robert might not c

\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Lannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling what the queen might do. \
\'93It might be safest if I went on ahead,\'94 he told 
\f2\fs24 P
\f1\fs28 oole. \'93I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen. The rest of you can follow when you are ready. Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone. The castle is full of eye
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.\'94 \
\'93As you command, my l

When he had gone, Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding. Robert had left him no choice that he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be good to return to Winterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a n
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w son together when he returned, they were not so old yet. And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at nigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . \
And yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked . . . or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their lo
\f3 ans. And t
\f1 he t
\f3 ruth of Jon 
\f1 Arryn\'92s death still eluded him. Oh, he had f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 und a few pieces, enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there, lurking, hidden, treacherous. \
It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 but if he took ship he could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water, with a polite letter from Ned reque
\f3 stin
\f1 g Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the silence only deepened his suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain of it
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen. \
And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. S
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 me secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and tr
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 st. Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought him o
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t of the sheath on his belt. The Imp\'92s knife. Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or only a different strand of the same web? \
Could Robert be par
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had tried to 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 arn him. You knew the man, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The sooner he was quit of King\'92s Landing, the better. If there was a ship sailing north on the morrow, it would be well to be on it. \
He summoned Vayon
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 Poole aga\cf2 in\cf3  and sent him to t\cf2 he\cf3  dock
\f2 \cf2 s
\f1 \cf3  to make \cf2 in\cf3 quiries, quietly b\cf2 ut\cf3  quic
\f2 \cf2 k
\f0\b\fs38 ly. \'93Fin
\f2\b0\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  me a fast ship with a skilled captain,\'94 he told the steward. \'93I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe. I wish to leave at once.\'94 \
Poole had no sooner t
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. \'93Lord Baelish to \
see you, m\'92lord.\'94 \
Ned was half-tempted to turn him away, but thought better of it. He was not free yet; until he was, he must play their games. \'93Show him in, Tom.\'94 \
Lord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning. He wore a slashed velvet doublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox, and his customary mocking smile. \
Ned greeted him coldly. \'93Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?\'94 \
\'93I won\'92t detain you long, I\'92m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig. She has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter, so her table is always astonishing. If truth be told, I\'92d sooner marry the pig, but don\'92t tell her. I do love lamprey pie.\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t let me 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 eep you from your eels, my lord,\'94 Ned said with icy disdain. \'93At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.\'94 \
\'93Oh, I\'92m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names. Varys, say. Cersei. Or Robert. His Grace is most wroth with you. He went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning. The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently, I seem to recall.\'94 \
Ned did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but Littlefinger took one anyway. \'93After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men,\'94 he continued blithely. \'93Instead Var
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 s will quietly let it be known that we\'92ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targa
\f3 ryen girl.\'94 \
Ned was d
\f1 isgusted. \'93So now we grant titles to assassins.\'94 \
Littlefinger shrugged. \'93Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her. Likely he\'92ll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we\'92d sent a Faceless Man after her, she\'92d be as good as buried.\'94 \
Ned frowned. \'93You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me for?\'94 \
\'93Well, quite an enormous one, actually,\'94 said Littlefinger, laughing. \
\'93Do you alwa
\f3 ys find murder so 
\f1 amusing, Lord Baelish?\'94 \
\'93It\'92s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it\'92s you. You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice. I daresay you will make a noble splash. I believe I heard the fir
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t crack this morning.\'94 \
\'93The first and last,\'94 said Ned. \'93I\'92ve had my fill.\'94 \'93When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?\'94 \'93As soon as I can. What concern is that of yours?\'94 \
\'93None . . . but if perchance you\'92re still here come evenfall, I\'92d be pleased to take you to this brothel your man Jory has been searching for so ineffectually.\'94 Littlefinger smiled. \'93And I won\'92t even tell the Lady Catelyn.\'94 \

CATELYN 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,\'94 Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass. \'93We would have sent an escort. The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party as small as yours.\'94 \
\'93We learned that t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  our sorrow, Ser Donnel,\'94 Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could not even find it in her to weep for them. Even their names were fading. \'93The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the first attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister\'92s serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain.\'94 They had drawn up for a last desperate fight, blades in hand and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them, the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white. Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight. \
\'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,\'94 Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky youth of twenty y
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ars, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair. \'93If it were up to me, I would take a hu
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 dred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but your sister has forbidden it. She would not even permit her knig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ts to fight in the Hand\'92s tourney. She wan
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 s all our swords kept close to home, to defend the Vale . . . against what, no one is certain. Shadow
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , some say.\'94 He looked at her anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. \'93I hope I have not spoken out of turn, my lady. I meant no offense.\'94 \
\'93Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.\'94 Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not shadows, Lannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them had grown thick a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  thieves since Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked. When they had entered the mountains, he had been her capt
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ve, bound and helpless. What was he now? Her captive still, yet he rode along with a d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing the shadowskin cloak he\'92d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he\'92d taken off Chiggen\'92s corpse. Two score
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn\'92s young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be wrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest? And if he was, what did that make her? 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 ix men had died to bring him here. \
Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. \'93When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.\'94 More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him. \
Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. \'93The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,\'94 he said. \'93We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded. He can see to your man\'92s hurts.\'94 \
Catelyn had more faith in a maester\'92s learning than a septon\'92s prayers. She was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scar
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge.
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 When they ha
\f1 d climbed almost to 
\f3 the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were grey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-re
\f1 d of Riverrun, and a shiny black
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fish, wrought in gold and obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. \'93Who would pass the Blood
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  Gate?\'94 he called. \
\'93Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companion
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 the young knight answered. \
The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. \'93I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far from hom
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , little Cat.\'94 \
\'93And you, Uncle,\'94 she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood. \
\'93My home is at my back,\'94 he said gruffly. \
\'93Your home is in my heart,\'94 Catelyn told him. \'93Tak
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  off your helm. I would look on your face again.\'94 \
\'93The years have not improved it, I fear,\'94 Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from his 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 air and left him only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in his deep blue eyes. \'93Did Lysa know you were coming?\'94 \
\'93There was no time to send word ahead,\'94 Catelyn told him. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e others were coming up behind her. \'93I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.\'94 \
\'93May we enter the Vale?\'94 Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony. \
\'93In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,\'94 Ser Brynden replied. \'93Come.\'94 \
And so she ro
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e behind him, beneath the shadow of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side of the stoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky, and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn bathed in the morning light. \
It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow- moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields, and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road crested the las
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was narrow here, no more than a half day\'92s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant\'92s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa\'92s Tears. Even from this distance, Catelyn could make out the shi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ing silver thread, bright against the dark stone. \
When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. \'93It\'92s there, beside Alyssa\'92s Tears. All you can see f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.\'94 \
Seven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds. \'93How long a ride?\'94 she asked. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93We can be at the mountain by evenfall,\'94 Uncle Brynden said, \'93but the climb will take another day.\'94 \
Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. \'93My lady,\'94 he said, \'93I fear I can go no farther \
today.\'94 His face sagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse. \
\'93Nor should you,\'94 she said. \'93You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more. My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason 
\f3 that 
\f1 you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength.\'94 \
\'93We should be honored 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o have them to guest,\'94 Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young. Beside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and Marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads. \
\'93My lady,\'94 Marillion said, riding forward. \'93I beg you allow me to accompany you 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings.\'94 The boy sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; he had a fevered shine to his eyes. \
Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made himself, and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them, she could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that made him look almost
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a man. Perhaps she owed him something for having come this far. \'93Very well,\'94 she told him. \
\'93I\'92ll come as well,\'94 Bronn announced. \
She liked that less well. Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his swor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  had helped cut them through to safety. Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in him, and little loyalty. And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke. Sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn. \'93As you wish,\'94 she said, although she 
\f3 noted
\f1  that he had not actuall
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  asked her permission. \
Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their wounds. Their horses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the G
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 tes of the Moon with the word of their coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted mounta
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. Catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind came Bronn, Tyrion Lannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden\'92s men. \
Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the others, did Brynden Tully turn to her and say, \'93So, child. Tell me about this storm of yours.\'94 \
\'93I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,\'94 Catelyn said, but she told him nonetheless. It took longer than she would have beli
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ved to tell it all, Lysa\'92s letter and Bran\'92s fall, the assassin\'92s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroads inn. \
Her uncle listened silently
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper. Brynden Tully had always known how to listen . . . to anyone but her father. He was Lord Hoster\'92s brother, younger by 
\f3 five
\f1  years, but the two of them had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 uring one of their louder quarrels, when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden \'93the black goat of the Tully flock.\'94 Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he ought to be a black fish
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 rather than a black goat, and from that day forward h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had 
\f3 taken 
\f1 it as his personal emblem. \
The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 oster had not spoken his brother\'92s name since, from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters. \
Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn\'92s girlhood, it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster\'92s children had run with their tears
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and their tales, 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hen Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure . . . and yes, even Petyr Baelish, their father\'92s ward . . . he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened now, laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes. \
When she was done, her uncle remained silent for a long time, as his ho
\f3 rse ne
\f1 gotiated the steep, rocky trail. \'93Your father must be told,\'94 he said at last. \'93If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.\'94 \
\'93I\'92d had the same 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ear,\'94 Catelyn admitted. \'93I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach the Eyrie.\'94 She had other messages to send as well; the commands that Ned ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  given her for his bannermen, to ready the defenses of the north. \'93What is the mood in the Vale?\'94 she asked. \
\'93Angry,\'94 Brynden Tully admitted. \'93Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years. Lysa has commanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East, but \
no one is fooled. Nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the Hand\'92s death. None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but suspici
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n casts a long shadow.\'94 He gave Catelyn a look, his mouth tight. \'93And there is the boy.\'94 \
\'93The boy? What of him?\'94 She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of rock, and around a sharp turn. \
Her uncle\'92s voice was troubled. \'93Lord Robert,\'94 he sighed. \'93Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away. Jon Arryn\'92s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father\'92s seat, Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon served in King\'92s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age. Others believe that Lysa must marry again, and soon. Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield. The Eyrie is full of them.\'94 \
\'93I might have expected that,\'94 Catelyn said. Small wonder the
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e; Lysa was still young, and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift. \'93Will Lysa take another husband?\'94 \
\'93She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,\'94 Brynden Tully said, \'93but she has already rejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She swears that this time she will choose her lord husband.\'94 \
\'93You of all people 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 an scarce fault her for that.\'94 \
Ser Brynden snorted. \'93Nor do I, but . . . it seems to me Lysa is only playing at courtship. She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.\'94 \
\'93A woman can rule as wisely as a man,\'94 Catelyn said. \
\'93The right woman can,\'94 her uncle said with a sideways glance. \'93Make no mistake, Cat. Lysa is not you.\'94 He hesitated a moment. \'93If truth be told, I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like.\'94 \
She was puzzled. \'93What do you mean?\'94 \
\'93The Lysa who came back from King\'92s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named Hand. Those years were hard for her. You must know. Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from politics, 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot passion.\'94 \
\'93As was my own.\'94 \
\'93They began t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e same, but your ending has been happier than your sister\'92s. Two babes stillborn, twice as many miscarriages, Lord Arryn\'92s death . . . Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa only the one child, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d he is all your sister lives for now, poor boy. Small wonder she fled rather than
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 see him handed over to the Lannisters. Your sister is afraid, child, and the Lannisters are what she fea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s most. She ran to the Vale, ste
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ling away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her son out of the lion\'92s mouth . . . and now you have brought the lion to her door
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93In chains,\'94 Catelyn said. A crevasse yawned on her right, falling away into darkness. She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step. \
\'93Oh?\'94 Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem. \'93I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow. Where are the chains, sweet one?\'94 \
Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat. \'93The dwarf is here, and not by choice. Chains or no, he is my prisoner. Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than I. It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them.\'94 \
Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary s
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ile. \'93I hope you are right, child,\'94 he sighed, in tones that said she was wrong. \
The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses. The road widened and grew straight, and for the first time Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 growing. Once they reached the valley floor, the going was faster and they made good time, cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little haml
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ts, past orchards and golden wheat fields, splashing across a dozen sunlit streams. Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them, a double banner flying from his staff; the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high, and below it his own black fish
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Farm wagons and merchants\'92 carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass. \
Even so, it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the Giant\'92s Lance. Torches flickered atop its ramparts, and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat. The drawbridge was up and the portcullis down, but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers beyond. \
\'93The Gates o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  the Moon,\'94 her uncle said as the party drew rein. His standard-bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse. \'93Lord Nestor\'92s seat. He should be expecting us. Look up.\'94 \
Catelyn raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and trees, the looming mass of the great m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 untain shrouded in night, as black as a starless sky. Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them; a tower keep, built upon the steep side of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes staring down from above. Abov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  that was another, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no more than a flickering spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the moonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 towers, so far above. \
\'93The Eyrie,\'94 she heard Marillion murmur, awed. \
The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. \'93The Arryns must not be overfond of company. If you\'92re planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, I\'92d rather you kill me here.\'94 \
\'93We\'92ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,\'94 Brynden told him. \
\'93I can scarcely wait,\'94 the dwarf replied. \'93How do we get up there? I\'92ve no experience at riding goats.\'94 \
\'93Mules,\'94 Brynden said, s
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 iling. \
\'93There are steps carved into the mountain,\'94 Catelyn said. Ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn. \
Her uncle nodded. \'93It is too dark to see them, bu
\f3 t the 
\f1 steps are there. Too steep and narrow
\f3  for 
\f1 horses, but mules can 
\f3 manage t
\f1 hem most of the way. The path is guarded by three waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky. The mules will ta
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e us as far up as Sky.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. \'93And beyond that?\'94 \
Brynden smiled. \'93Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot the rest of the way. Or perchance you\'92d prefer to ride a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 basket. The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below. I
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.\'94 \
The dwarf gave a ba
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k of laughter. \'93Would that I were a pumpkin,\'94 he said. \'93Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips. If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the same. We Lannisters do
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 have a certain pride.\'94 \
\'93Pride?\'94 Catelyn snapped. His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry. \'93Arrogance, some might call it. Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.\'94 \
\'93My brot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er is undoubtedly arrogant,\'94 Tyrion Lannister replied. \'93My father is the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath. I, however, am innocent as a little lamb. Shall I bleat for you?\'94 He grinned. \
The drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply, and they heard the sound of oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up. Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to light their way, and her uncle led them across the moat. Lord Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, was waiting in the yard to greet them, surrounded by his knights. \'93Lady Stark,\'94 he said, bowing. He was a massive, barrel-chested
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 man, and his bow was clumsy. \
Catelyn dismounted to stand before him. \'93Lord Nestor,\'94 she said. She knew the man only by reputation; Bronze Yohn
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s cousin, from a lesser branch of House Royce, yet still a formidable lord in his own right. \'93We have had a long and tiring journey. I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.\'94 \
\'93My roof is yours, my lady,\'94 Lord Nestor returne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  gruffly, \'93but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie. She wishes to see you at once. The rest of your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 party will be housed here and sent up at first light.\'94 \
Her uncle swung off his horse. \'93What madness is this?\'94 he said bluntly. Brynden Tully had never been a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 man to blunt the edge of his words. \'93A night ascent, with the moon not even full? Even Lysa should know that\'92s an invitation to a broken neck.\'94 \
\'93The mules know the way, Ser
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Brynden.\'94 A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years stepped up beside Lord Nestor. Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head, and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. She bowed to Catelyn, more gracefully than her lord. \'93I promise you, my lady, no harm will come to you. It would be my honor to take you up. I\'92v
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  made the dark climb a hundred times. Mychel says my father must have been a goat.\'94 \
She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile. \'93Do you have a name, child?\'94 \'93Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,\'94 the girl said. \
It did not please her; it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. Stone was a bastard\'92s name in the Vale, as Snow was in the north, and Flowers in Highgarden; in each of the Seven Kingdoms, custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no \
names of their own. Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but suddenly she could not help but think of Ned\'92s bastard on the Wall, and the thought made her angry and guilty, both at once. She struggle
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  to find words for a reply. \
Lord Nestor filled the silence. \'93Mya\'92s a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her. She has not failed me yet.\'94 \
\'93Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93Lord Nestor, I charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner.\'94 \
\'93And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before he dies of hunger,\'94 Lannister said. \'93A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose that\'92s too much to ask of you.\'94 The sellsword Bronn laughed aloud. \
Lord Nestor ignored the banter. \'93As you say, my lady, so it will be done.\'94 Only then did he look at t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e dwarf. \'93See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and mead.\'94 \
Catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off, then followed the bastard girl through the castle. Two mules were waiting in the upper bailey, saddled and ready. Mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate. Beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, chiseled deep into the rock, ascending into the sky. \'93Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,\'94 Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. \'93When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight. They don\'92t 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ike that.\'94 \
\'93I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93I do not frighten easily. Do you plan to light a torch?\'94 The steps were black as pitch. \
The girl made a face. \'93Torches just blind you. On a clear night like this, the moon and the stars are enough. Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.\'94 She mounted and urged her mule up the first step. Catelyn\'92s animal followed of its own accord. \
\'93You mentioned Mychel before,\'94 Catelyn said. The mules set the pace, slow but steady. She was perfectly content with that. \
\'93Mychel\'92s my love,\'94 Mya explained. \'93Mychel Redfort. He\'92s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We\'92
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.\'94 \
She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness. The Redf
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rts were an old name in the Vale, she knew, \
with the blood of the First Men in their veins. His love she might be, but no Redfort would ever wed a bastard. His family would arrange a more suitable match for him, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, it would be on the wrong side of the sheet. \
The ascent was
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 easier t
\f1 han Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it s
\f3 eemed as though they we
\f1 re moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h night-eyes. They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep. \
Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them. \'93Stone,\'94 Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya\'92s shout. Inside, the p
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rtly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in the yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care. \
Then it was up onto a new mule and
\f3  out 
\f1 again into the starlight. The second part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half- dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. \'93You don\'92t want your mule to break
\f3  a leg up here,\'94 she s
\f1 aid. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel the altitude more
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that tugged at h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 righter than candles. \
Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Gi
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nt\'92s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone sta
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r above the lower waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire, but Mya declined. \'93We ought to keep going, my lady,\'94 she said. \'93If it please you.\'94 Catelyn nodded. \
Again they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she saw him. \'93Whitey\'92s a good one, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful. He\'92ll kick if he doesn\'92t like you.\'94 \
The white mule seemed to like C
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 telyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. There was no ice either, and she was grateful for that as well. \'93My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,\'94 Mya told her. \'93It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.\'94 She shrugged. \'93I can\'92t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ay once, in the olden times.\'94 \
So young, C
\f3 atelyn th
\f1 ought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. The girl had lived half her life in summer, and that was all she knew. Winter is coming, child, she wanted to tell her. The words were on her lips; she almost said them. Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last. \
Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better to look up than down
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat. When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. \'93It\'92s best to lead the mules over,\'94 she said. \'93The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.\'94 \
Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long and close to three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 either side. She could hear the wind shrieking. Mya stepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing a bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped, trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pul
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sweat trickling down her back. \
\'93Lady Stark,\'94 Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues a
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ay. \'93Are you well?\'94 \
Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. \'93I . . . I cannot do this, child,\'94 she called out. \
\'93Yes you can,\'94 the bastard girl said. \'93I know you can. Look how wide the path is.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want to look.\'94 The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky and mules, whirling like a child\'92s top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing. \
\'93I\'92ll come back for you,\'94 Mya said. \'93Don\'92t move, my lady.\'94 \
Moving was about the last thing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the skirling of the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her gently by the arm. \'93Keep your eyes closed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I\'92ll lead you over, it\'92s easy, you\'92ll see. Give me a step now. That\'92s it, move your foot, just slide it forward. See. Now another. Easy. You could run across. Another one, go on. Yes.\'94 And so, foot by foot, ste
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  by step, the bastard girl led Catelyn across, blind and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly behind them. \
The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain, but even the topless towers of Valyria could not have looked more beautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at last the snow crown began; Sky\'92s weathered stones were rimed with frost, and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above. \
Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates opened before them. Inside the walls there was only a series
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of all sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here. A mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them. \'93The stables and barracks are in there,\'94 Mya said. \'93The last part is inside the mountain. It 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 an be a little dark, but at least you\'92re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules can go. Past here, well, it\'92s a sort of chimney, more like a stone la
\f3 dder t
\f1 han proper steps, but it\'92s not too bad
\f3 . An
\f1 other hour and we\'92ll be there.\'94 \
Catelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the founda
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 i
\f3 ons
\f1  of the Eyrie. It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From below it looked like a small white honeycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d winches. \'93The Lannisters may have their pride,\'94 she told Mya, \'93but the Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridde
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  all day and the best part of a night. Tell them to lower a baske
\f3 t. I s
\f1 hall ride with the turnips.\'94 \
The sun wa
\f3 s we
\f1 ll 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 bove the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn\'92s household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck. \'93Lady Stark,\'94 Ser Vardis said, \'93the p
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 easure is as great as it is \
unanticipated.\'94 Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement. \'93Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She left orders
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to be awakened the instant you arrived.\'94 \
\'93I hope she had a good night\'92s rest,\'94 Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 o unnoticed. \
The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a small castle by the standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the 
\f3 great mountain. It
\f1  had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its granary was as large as Winterfell\'92s, a
\f3 nd its towers could house fiv
\f1 e hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it, its
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pale stone halls echoing and empty. \
Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 long auburn hair tumb
\f3 led 
\f1 unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind her, brushing out the night\'92s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sist
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r rose to her feet, smiling. \'93Cat,\'94 she said. \'93Oh, Cat, how good 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t
\f3  is to
\f1  see you. My sweet sister.\'94 She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms. \'93How long it has been,\'94 Lysa murmured against her. \'93Oh, how very very long.\'94 \
It had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their toll. Her sister was two years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa had grown thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but hers were pale and watery, never st
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ll. Her small mouth had turned pe
\f3 tulant. As Cate
\f1 lyn held her, she remembered the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 lender, high-breasted girl who\'92d waited beside her that day in the sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained of her sister\'92s beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist. \
\'93You look well,\'94 Catelyn lied, \'93but . . . 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ired.\'94 \
Her sister broke the embrace. \'93Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.\'94 She seemed to notice the o
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hers then; her maid, Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis. \'93Leave us,\'94 she told them. \'93I wish to speak to my sister alone.\'94 She held Catelyn\'92s hand as they withdrew . . . \
. . . and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud. \'93Have you taken leave of your senses?\'94 Lysa snapped at her. \'93To bring him here, witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the Lannisters . .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . \'94 \
\'93My quarrels?\'94 Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing. A great fire burned in the hearth, but there was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 no trace of warmth in Lysa\'92s voice. \'93They were your quarrels \
first, sister. It was you who sent me that cursed let
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er, you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.\'94 \
\'93To warn you, so you could stay away
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 from them! I never meant to fight the
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ! Gods, Cat, do you know what you\'92ve done?\'94 \
\'93Mother?\'94 a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1 \cf3 e swirlin\cf2 g \cf3 around her. Robert\cf2  A\cf3 rryn,
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 Lord of t\cf2 he\cf3  Eyrie, stood in t\cf2 he\cf3  door
\f2 \cf2 w
\f0\b\fs38 ay, clu
\f2\b0\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes. He was a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled. The shaking sickness, the maesters called it. \'93I heard voices.\'94 \
Small wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her sister looked daggers at her. \'93This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady Stark. Do you remember?\'94 \
The boy glanced at her blankly. \'93I think so,\'94 he said, blinking, though he had been less tha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him. \
Lysa seated herself near the fire and said, \'93Come to Mother, my sweet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 one.\'94 She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. \'93Isn\'92t he beautiful? And strong too, don\'92t you believe the things you hear. Jon knew. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he seed is strong, he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert\'92s name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.\'94 \
\'93Lysa,\'94 Catelyn said, \'93if you\'92re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must act quickly. We\'97\'94 \
\'93Not in f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ont of the baby,\'94 Lysa said. \'93He has a delicate temper, don\'92t you, sweet one?\'94 \'93The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,\'94 Catelyn reminded her, \'93and \
these are no times for delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war.\'94 \
\'93Quiet!\'94 Ly
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 a snapped at her. \'93You\'92re scaring the boy.\'94 Little Robert took a quick peek over his should
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he pressed himself against his mother. \'93Don\'92t be afraid, my sweet baby,\'94 Lysa whispered. \'93Mother\'92s here, nothing will hurt you.\'94 She opened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 troked his hair. \
Catelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Arryn\'92s son, she thought incredulously. She \
remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s boy and five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive. For the fir
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the Lannisters . . . \
\'93We\'92re safe here,\'94 Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure. \
\'93Don\'92
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  be a fool,\'94 Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. \'93No one is safe. If you think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken.\'94 \
Lysa covered her boy\'92s ear with her hand. \'93Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the E
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rie is impregnable. You saw for yourself. No enemy could ever reach us up here.\'94 \
Catelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. \'93No castle is impregnable.\'94 \
\'93This one is,\'94 Lysa insisted. \'93Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have brought me?\'94 \
\'93Is he a bad man?\'94 the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother\'92s breast popping from his mouth, the nipple wet and red. \
\'93A very bad man,\'94 Lysa told him as she covered herself, \'93but Mother won\'92t let him harm my little baby.\'94 \
\'93Make him fly,\'94 Robert said e
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 gerly. \
Lysa stroked her son\'92s hair. \'93Perhaps we will,\'94 she murmured. \'93Perhaps that is just what we will do.\'94 \

EDDARD \
He found Littlefinger in the brothel\'92s common room, chatting amiably with a tall, elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink. By the hearth, Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits. From the look of it, he\'92d lost his belt, his cloak, his mail shirt, and his right bo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t so far, while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on his face, watching Heward turn over
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tiles and enjoying the view. \
Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves. \'93It\'92s time
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 we took our leave. My business here is done.\'94 \
Heward lurched to his feet, hurriedly gathering up his things. \'93As you will, my lord,\'94 Jory said. \'93I\'92ll help Wyl bring round the horses.\'94 He strode to the door. \
Littlefinger took his time saying h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s farewells. He kissed the black woman\'92s hand, whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned. \'93Your business,\'94 he said lightly, \'93or Robert\'92s? They say the Hand dreams the king\'92s dreams, speaks with the king\'92s voice, and rules with the king\'92s sword. Does that also mean y
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 u fuck with
\f1  the king\'92s\'97\'94 \
\'93Lord Baelish,\'94 Ned interrupted, \'93you presume too much. I am not ungrateful for y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ur help. It might have taken us years to find this brothel without you. That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery. And I am no longer the King\'92s Hand.\'94 \
\'93The direwolf must be a prickly beast,\'94 said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth. \
A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables. Ned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 drew up the hood of his cloak. Jory brought out his hor
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e. Young Wyl came right behind him, leading Littlefinger\'92s mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers. A barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door, giggling at him. \
\'93Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?\'94 Jory asked. Ned nodded and swung into the saddle. Littlefinger mounted up beside him. Jory and the others followed. \
\'93Chataya runs a choice establishment,\'94 Littlefinger said as they rode. \'93I\'92ve half a mind to \
buy it. Brothels are a much sounder investment than ships, I\'92ve found. Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded by pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone else.\'94 Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit. \
Ned let him prattle on. After a time, he quieted and they rode in silence. The streets of King\'92s Landing were dark and deserted. The rain had driven everyone under their roofs. It beat down on Ned\'92s head, warm as blood and relentless as old guilts. Fat drops of water ran down his face. \
\'93Robert 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ill never keep to one bed,\'94 Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm\'92s End. \'93I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.\'94 Ned had held the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a good man and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. \'93Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  nature.\'94 \
The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she\'92d been a virgin; the better
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat enough. She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that her bosom was freckled as well. \'93I named her Barra,\'94 she said as the chil
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  nursed. \'93She looks so like him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair . . . \'94 \
\'93She does.\'94 Eddard Stark had touched the baby\'92s fine, dark hair. It flowed through his fingers like black silk. Rob
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rt\'92s firstborn had had the same fine hair, he seemed to recall. \
\'93Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it . . . as it please you. Tell him how beauti
\f3 ful she
\f1  is.\'94 \
\'93I will,\'94 Ned had promised her. That was his curse. Robert would swear undyi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g love and forget them before evenfall, but Ned Stark kept his vows. He thought of the promises he\'92d made Lyanna as she lay dying, and the price he\'92d paid to keep them. \
\'93And tell him I\'92ve not been with no one else. I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new. Chataya said I could have half a yea
\f3 r, for 
\f1 the baby, and for hoping he\'92d come back. So you\'92ll tell him I\'92m waiting, won\'92t you? I don\'92t want no jewels or nothing, just him. He was always good to me, truly.\'94 \
Good to y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u, Ned thought hollowly. \'93I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall not go wanting.\'94 \
She had smiled t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en, a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him. Riding through the rainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow\'92s fa
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e in
\f3  fro
\f1 nt of him, so like a younger version of his own. If the gods frowned so on bastards, he thought dully, why did they fill men with such lusts? \'93Lord Baelish, what do you know of Robert\'92s bastards?\'94 \
\'93Well, he has more than 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou, for a start.\'94 \'93How many?\'94 \
Littlefinger shrugged. Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak. \'93Does it matter? If 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou bed enough women, some will give you prese
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ts, and His Grace has never been shy on that count. I know he\'92s acknowledged that boy at Storm\'92s End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He could hardly do otherwise. The mother was a Florent
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  niece to the Lady Selyse, one of he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  think that was a blot on the honor of his wife\'92s House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly.\'94 He gave Ned a sideways glance. \'93I\'92ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nch at Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin\'92s tourney. Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver. Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home.\'94 \
Ned Stark grimaced. Ugly tales like that were told of every
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 great lord in the realm. He could believe it of Cersei Lannister readily enough . . . but would the king stand by and let it happen? The Robert he had known would not have, but the Robert he had known had never been so practi
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ed at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see. \'93Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king\'92s baseborn children?\'94 \
The short man gave a sodden shrug. \'93He was the King\'92s Hand. Doubtless Robert asked him to see that they were provided for.\'94 \
Ned was soaked through to the bone, and his soul had grown cold. \'93It had to be more than that, or why kill him?\'94 \
Littlefinger shook th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rain from his hair and laughed. \'93Now I see. Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to be silenced. Small wonder. Allow a man like that to live, and next he\'92s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east.\'94 \
There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not. \
The rain was falling harder now, stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground. Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 called out, \'93My lord,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his voice hoarse with alarm. And in an instant, 
\f3 the stree
\f1 t was full of soldiers. \
Ned glimpsed ringmail over leather, gauntlets and greaves, steel helms with go
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d
\f3 en 
\f1 lions on the crests. Their cloaks clung to their backs, sodden with rain. He had no time to count, but there were ten at least, a line of them, on foot, blocking the street, with longswords and iron-tipped spears. \'93Behind!\'94 he heard Wyl cry, and when he turned his horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off their retreat. Jory\'92s sword came si
\f3 nging 
\f1 from its scabbard. \'93Make way or die!\'94 \
\'93The wolves are howling,\'94 their leader said. Ned could see rain running down his face. \'93Such a small pack, though.\'94 \
Littlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. \'93What is the meaning of this? This is the Hand of the King.\'94 \
\'93He was the Hand of the King.\'94 The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion. The line parted before him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared its defiance. \'93Now, if truth be told, I\'92m not sure what he is
\f3 .\'94 
\f1 \
\'93Lannister, th
\f3 is is madne
\f1 ss,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93Let us pass. We are expected back at the castle. What do you think you\'92re doing?\'94 \
\'93He knows what he\'92s doing,\'94 Ned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said calmly. \
Jaime Lannister smiled. \'93Quite true. I\'92m looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don\'92t you, Lord Stark? He was with us at Winterfell. Fair-haired, mismatched eyes, sharp of tongue. A short man.\'94 \
\'93I remember him well,\'94 Ned replied. \
\'93It would seem he has met some trouble on the road. My lord father is quite vexed. You would not perchance h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would you?\'94 \
\'93Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,\'94 Ned Stark said. Littlefinger groaned in dismay. \'93My lords\'97\'94\
Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward. \'93Show \
me your steel, Lord Eddard. I\'92ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I\'92d sooner you d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed with a blade in your hand.\'94 He gave Littlefinger a cool, contemptuous glance. \'93Lord Baelish, I\'92d leav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  here in some haste if I did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing.\'94 \
Littlefinger did not need to be urged. \'93I will bring the City Watch,\'94 he promised Ned. The Lannister line parted to let him through, and closed behind him. Littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished around a corner. \
Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 \'92s men had drawn their swords, but they were three against twenty. Eyes watched from nearby windows and doors, but no one was about to intervene. His party was mounted, the Lannisters on foot save for Jaime himself. A charge might win them free, but it seemed to Eddard Stark that 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1 \cf3 hey had a\cf2  s\cf3 urer, safer tactic\cf2 . \cf3 \'93Kill
\f2 \cf2

\f2 \cf2 C
\f0\b\fs38 atelyn wi
\f2\b0\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l most certainly slay Tyrion.\'94 \
Jaime Lannister poked at Ned\'92s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings. \'93Would she?
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage? I think . . . not.\'94 He sighed. \'93
\f3 But I am n
\f1 ot willing to chance my brother\'92s life on a woman\'92s honor.\'94 Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath. \'93So I suppose I\'92ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you. I wonder if he\'92ll care.\'94 Ja
\f3 ime pushe
\f1 d his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around. Wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at his captain. \'93Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark.\'94 \
\'93As you say, m\'92lord.\'94 \
\'93Still . . . we wouldn\'92t wa

\f3 rough the nigh
\f1 t and the rain, he glimpsed the white of Jaime\'92s smile\'97\'93kill his men.\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 Ned Stark screamed, clawing for his sword. Jaime was already cantering off down the street as he heard Wyl shout. Men closed from both sides. Ned rode one down, cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him.
\f3  Jory Cassel
\f1  put his heels into his mount and charged. A steel-s
\f3 hod 
\f1 hoof caught a Lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening crunch. A second man reeled away and for an instant Jory was free. Wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned galloped to him, bringing his longsword down on Tregar\'92s helm. The jolt of impact made him grit his teeth. Tregar stumbled to his knees, his lion crest sheared in half, blood running down his face. Hew
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd was hacking
\f3  at 
\f1 the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the belly. Suddenly Jory was back among them, a red rain flying from his sword. \'93No!\'94 Ned shouted. \'93Jory, away!\'94 Ned\'92s horse slipped under him and came crash
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng down in the mud. There was a moment of blinding 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ain and the taste of blood in his mouth. \
He saw them cut the legs from Jory\'92s mount and drag him to the earth, swords rising and failing as they closed in around him. When Ned\'92s horse lurched back to its feet, he tried to rise, only to fall again, choking on his scream. He could see the splintered bone poking through his calf. It was the last thing he saw for a time. The rain came down and down and down. \
When he opened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse moved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to drag himself through the mud, gritting 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is teeth at the agony in his leg. It seemed to take years. Faces watched from candlelit windows, and people began to emerge from alleys and doors, but no one moved to help. \
Littlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street, cradlin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  Jory Cassel\'92s body in his arms. \
Somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter, but th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  trip back to the castle was a blur of agony, and Ned lost consciousness more than once. He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn. The rain had darkened the pale pink s
\f3 tone
\f1  of the massive walls to the color of blood. \
Then Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him, holding a cup, whispering, \'93Drink, my lord. Here. The milk of the poppy, for your
\f3  pa
\f1 in.\'94 He remembered swallowing, and Pycelle was telling someone
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk, and that was the last he kne

DAENERYS \
The Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing, their hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch. \
Dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls . . . and no buildings that she could see. Yet there it stood, immense and beautiful, the great horses framing the distant purple mountain beyond
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The bronze stallions threw long shadow
\f3 s across the 
\f1 waving g
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 asses as Khal Drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down the godsway, his bloodriders beside him. \
Dany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys, mounted once more. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar, the Dothraki had laughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even kno
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n he was being mocked; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old. That won him yet another name: Khal Rhaggat, t
\f3 he Ca
\f1 rt King. Her brother had thought it was t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e khal\'92s way of apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell him the truth, lest he be shamed. The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame . . . yet he had done as s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e bid. It had taken much pleading, and all the pillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys to rejoin them
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at the head of the column. \
\'93Where is the city?\'94 she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There were no buildings to 
\f3 be seen,
\f1  no people, only the grass and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the road, lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 centuries. \
\'93Ahead,\'94 Ser
\f3  Jorah a
\f1 nswered. \'93Under the mountain.\'94 \
Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them. The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past their feet. Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones, their faces chipped and stained, even their names lost in the mists of time.

\f1\fs28  or poured air from shattered jars. Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with jewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed tails poised to stri
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e, and other \
beasts she could not name. Some of the statues were so lovely the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  took her breath away, others so misshapen and terrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them. Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. \
\'93So many,\'94 she said as her silver stepped slow
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y onward, \'93and from so many lands.\'94 \
Viserys was less impressed. \'93The trash of dead cities,\'94 he sneered. He was careful to speak in the Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany found herself glancing back at the men of her khas, to make certain he had not been overheard. He went on blithely. \'93All these savages know how to do 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s steal the things better 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 en have built . . . and kill.\'94 He laughed. \'93They do know how to kill. Otherwise I\'92d have no use for them at all.\'94 \
\'93They are my people now,\'94 Dany said. \'93You should not call them savages, brother.\'94 \
\'93The dragon speaks as he likes,\'94 Viserys said . . . in the Common Tongue. He glanced over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a m
\f3 ockin
\f1 g smile. \'93See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men.\'94 A mo
\f3 ss-eaten
\f1  st
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne monolith loomed over t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e road, fifty feet tall. Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes. \'93How long must we linger amidst these ruins before Drogo gives me my army? I grow tired of waiting.\'94 \
\'93The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen . . . \'94 \
\'93The crones, yes
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 her brother interrupted, \'93and there\'92s to be some mummer\'92s show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly, you told me. What is that to me? I\'92m tired of eating horsemeat and I\'92m sick of the stink of these savages.\'94 He sniffed at the wide, floppy sleeve
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of his tunic, where it was his cus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 om to keep a sachet. It could not have helped much. The tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn out of Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat. \
Ser Jorah Mormont said, \'93The Western Market will have food more to your taste, Your Grace. The traders from the Free Cit
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 es come there to sell their wares. The 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 hal will honor his promise in his own time.\'94 \
\'93He had better,\'94 Viserys said grimly. \'93I was promised a c
\f3 rown,
\f1  and I mean to have it. The dragon is not mocked.\'94 Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret\'92s head, he rode off to inspect it more closely. \
Dany was relieved, yet no less anxious. \'93I pray that my sun-and-stars will not keep him waiting too long,\'94 she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot. \
The knight looked after Viserys
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 doubtfully. \'93Your brother should have b
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ded his time in Pentos. There is no place for him in a khalasar. Illyrio tried to warn him.\'94 \
\'93He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand. My lord husband promised a golden crown.\'94 \
Ser Jorah grunted. \'93Yes, Khaleesi, but . . . the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the west. I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but your brother does not listen. The horselords are no traders. Viserys thinks he sold you, and now he wants his price. Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift. He will give Viserys a gift in return, yes . . . in his own time. You do not demand a gift, not of a khal. You do not demand anything of a khal.\'94 \
\'93It is not right to make him wait.\'94 Dany did not know why she was defending her brother, yet she was. \'93Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers.\'94 \
Ser Jorah snorted. \'93Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.\'94 \
Dany could not 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 retend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. \'93What . . . what if it were not Viserys?\'94 she asked. \'93If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?\'94 \
Ser Jorah\'92s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway. \'93When I first w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as their 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 orses. If you had asked me then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki.\'94 \
\'93But if I asked you now?\'94 \
\'93Now,\'94 the knight said, \'93I am less certain. They are bet

\f1\fs28 er riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreati
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g, it makes no matter, t
\f3 hey are full 
\f1 as deadly . . . and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.\'94 \
\'93Is that truly so
\f3  many?\'94 
\f1 \
\'93Your brother R
\f3 haegar
\f1  brought as many men to the Trident,\'94 Ser Jorah admitted, \'93but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 oldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down \
their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?\'94 \
\'93Not long,\'94 she said, \'93not well.\'94 \
He nodded. \'93Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle . . . \'94 \
\'93Is he?\'94 Dany asked. \'93A fool, I mean?\'94 \
Ser Jorah c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nsidered that for a moment. \'93Robert should have been born Dothraki,\'94 he said at last. \'93Your khal would tell you that only a coward hi
\f3 des be
\f1 hind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand. The Usurper would agree. He is a strong man, brave . . . and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a differ
\f3 ent tune. 
\f1 His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark . . . \'94 He spat. \
\'93You hate this Lord Stark,\'94 Dany said. \
\'93He took from me all I lo
\f3 ved, for the 
\f1 sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his pre
\f3 cious ho
\f1 nor,\'94 Ser Jo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss still pained him. He changed the subject quickly. \'93There,\'94 he announced, pointing. \'93Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.\'94 \
Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Wes
\f3 tern Mark
\f1 et, down the broad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the strangeness about her. Vaes Dothrak was at once the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 larges
\f3 t cit
\f1 y and the smallest that she had ever known. She thought it must be ten times as large as Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers. In the Free
\f3  Cit
\f1 ies of the west, towers an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  manses and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and
\f3  empt
\f1 y. \
Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, m
\f3 anses
\f1  of woven grass as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with marble, log halls open to the sky. In place
\f3  of walls
\f1 , some palaces were surrounded by thorny h
\f3 edge
\f1 s. \'93None of them are alike,\'94 she said. \
\'93Your brother had part of the truth,\'94 Ser Jorah ad
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 itted. \'93The Dothraki do not build. A \
thousand years ago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof. The buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they\'92ve plundered, and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples.\'94 \
Most of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. \'93Where are the people who live here?\'94 Dany asked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but e
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 sewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business. \
\'93Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and servants,\'94 Ser Jorah replied, \'93yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar, should all the khals return to the Mother at once. The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.\'94 \
Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming overh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 d. Dany 
\f1 smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio\'92s slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. The \'93palace\'94 was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, its rough-hewn timb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red walls rising forty feet, its roof sewn silk, a vast billowin
\f3 g te
\f1 nt that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit the endless sky. Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, firepits, and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills, covered with grass. \
A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo\'92s arrival. As each rider s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ung down from his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waitin
\f3 g sl
\f1 ave, and any other weapons he carried as well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt. Ser Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man\'92s blood. Even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in si
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht of the Mother of Mountains. In this place, the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed, all Dothraki were one blood, one khalasar, one herd. \
Cohollo came to Dany as Irri an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Jhiqui were helping her down off her silver. He was the oldest of Drogo\'92s three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth, shattered by a mace twenty years before when he saved the young khalakka from sellswords who hoped to se
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l him to his father\'92s enemies. His life had been bound to Drogo\'92s the day her lord husband was b
\f3 orn. \
E
\f1 ver
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  khal had his bloodriders. At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard, sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the khal\'92s brothers, his shadows, \
his fiercest friends. \'93Blood of my blood,\'94 Drogo called them, and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal\'92s wine, his tent, and even his wives, though never 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is horses. A man\'92s mount was his own. \
Daenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She should not have liked being shared. And while old Cohollo treated her kindly enough, the others frightened her; Haggo, huge and silent, often glowered as if he had forgotten who she was, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hands that liked to hurt. He left bruises on Doreah\'92s soft white skin whenever he touched
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 h
\f3 er, and 
\f1 sometimes made Irri sob in the night. Even his horses seemed to fear him. \
Yet they were bound to Drogo f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but 
\f3 to accept them. 
\f1 And sometimes she found herself wishing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her father had been protected by such men. In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one 
\f3 of t
\f1 hem, the handsome boy they now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, had gone over to the Usurper. She won
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ered if all men were as false in the Seven Kingdoms. When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his Kingsguard.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Khaleesi,\'94 Cohollo said to her, in Dothraki. \'93Drogo, who is blood of my blood, commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to sacrifice to the god
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  for his safe return.\'94 \
Only men wer
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  allowed to set foot on the Mother, Dany knew. The khal\'92s bloodriders would go with him, and return at dawn. \'93Tell my sun-and-stars that I 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ream of him, and wait anxious for his return,\'94 she replied, thankful. Dany tired more easily as the child grew within her; in truth, a night of rest
\f3  woul
\f1 d be most welcome. Her pregnancy only seemed to have inflamed Drogo\'92s desire for her, and of late his embraces left her exha
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 sted. \
Doreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her khal. It was 
\f3 cool
\f1  an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  dim within, like a tent made of earth. \'93Jhiqui, a bath, please,\'94 she commanded, to wash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones. It was pleasant to know that they would linger here for a while, that she would not need 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o climb back on her silver on the morrow. \
The water was scalding hot, as she liked it. \'93I will give my brother his gifts tonight,\'94 she decided as Jhiqui was washing her hair. \'93He should look a king in the sacred city. \
Doreah, run and find him and invite him to sup with me.\'94 Viserys was nicer to the Lysene g
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rl than to her Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because Magister Illyrio had let him bed her back in Pentos. \'93Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat. Anything but horseflesh.\'94 \
\'93Horse is best,\'94 Irri said. \'93Horse 
\f3 makes a m
\f1 an strong.\'94 \'93Viserys hates horsemeat.\'94\
\'93As you say, Kha
\f3 leesi
\f1 .\'94 \
She brought back a haunch of goat and a basket of fruits and vegetables. Jhiqui roasted the meat with sweetgrass and firepod
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , basting it with honey as it cooked, and there were melons and pomegranates and plums and some queer eastern fruit Dany did not know. While her handmaids prepared 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he meal, Dany laid out the clothing she\'92d had made to her brother\'92s measure: a tunic and leggings of crisp white linen, leather sandals that laced u
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  to the knee, a bronze 
\f3 medallio
\f1 n belt, a leather ves
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  painted with fire-breathing dragons. The Dothraki would respect him more if he looked less a beggar, she hoped, and perhaps he would forgive her for shaming him that day in the grass. He was still her king, afte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  all, and her brother. They were both blood of the dragon. \
She was arranging the last of his gifts\'97a sandsilk cloak, green as grass, with a pale grey border that would bring out the silver in his hair\'97when Viserys arrived, dragging Doreah by the arm. Her eye was red where he\'92d hit her. \'93How dare you send this whore to give me commands,\'94 he said. He shoved the handmaid roughly to the carpet. \
The anger took Dany utterly by surprise. \'93I only wanted . . . Doreah, what d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d you say?\'94 \
\'93Khaleesi, pardons, forgive me. I went to him, as you bid, and told him you commanded him to join you for supper.\'94 \
\'93No one commands t
\f3 he d
\f1 ragon,\'94 Viserys snarled. \'93I am your king! I s
\f3 hould
\f1  have sent you back her head!\'94 \
The Lysene girl quailed, but Dany calmed her with 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1 \cf3  touch. \'93\cf2 Do\cf3 n\'92t be afraid, he \cf2 wo\cf3 n\'92t h
\f2 \cf2 u
\f1 \cf3 rt you. S\cf2 we\cf3 et brother, please\cf2 , \cf3 forgi
\f2 \cf2 v
\f0\b\fs38 e her
\f2\b0\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  the girl misspoke herself, I told her to ask you to sup with me, if it pleases Your Grace.\'94 She took him by the hand and drew him across the room. \'93Look. These are for you.\'94 \
Viserys frowned suspiciously. \'93What is all this?\'94\
\'93New raiment. I had it made for you.\'94 Dany smiled sh
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ly. \
He looked at her and sn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ered. \'93Dothraki rags. Do you presume to dress me now?\'94 \
\'93Please . . . you\'92ll be cooler and more comfortable, and I thought . . . maybe if you dressed like
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them, the Dothraki . . . \'94 Dany did not know how to say it without waking his dragon. \
\'93Next you\'92ll want to braid my h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ir.\'94 \
\'93I\'92d never . . . \'94 Why was he always so cruel? She had only wanted to help. \'93You have no right to a braid, you have won no victories yet.\'94 \
It was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone from his lilac eyes, yet he dared not strike her, not with her handmaids watching and the warriors of her khas outside. Viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at it. \'93This stinks of manure. Perhaps I shall use it as a horse blanket.\'94 \
\'93I had Doreah sew it specially for you,\'94 she told him, wounded. \'93These are garments fit for a khal.\'94 \
\'93I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  hair,\'94 Viserys spat back at her. He grabbed her arm. \'93You forget yourself, slut. Do you think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon?\'94 \
His fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child again, quailing in the face of his rage. She reached out with her other hand and grabbed the first thing she touched, the belt she\'92d hoped to give him, a heavy chain of ornate bronze medallions. She swung it with all her strength. \
It caught him full in the face. Viserys let go of her. Blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open. \'93You are the one who forgets himself,\'94 Dany said to him. \'93Didn\'92t you learn anything that day in the grass? Leave me now, bef
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re I summon my khas to drag you out. And pray that Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails.\'94 \
Viserys scrambled back to his feet. \'93When I come into my kingdom, you will rue this day, slut.\'94 He walked off,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 holding his torn face, leaving her gifts behind him. \
Drops of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak. Dany clutched the soft cloth to her cheek and sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats. \
\'93Your supper is ready, Khaleesi,\'94 Jhiqui announced. \
\'93I\'92m not hungry,\'94 Dany said sadly. She was suddenly very tired. \'93Share the food among yourselves, and send some to Ser Jorah, if you wo
\f3 uld.\'94 After a mo
\f1 me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t she added, \'93Please, bring me one of the dragon\'92s eggs.\'94 \
Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she turned it in her small hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow betwe
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n her swollen belly and small, tender breasts. She liked to hold them. They were so beautiful, and sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow she were drawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside. \
She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt the child move within her . . . as if he were reaching out, brother 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o brother, blood to blood. \'93You are the dragon,\'94 Dany whispered to him, \'93the true dragon. I know it. I know it.\'94 And she smiled, and went to sleep dreaming of home. \

BRAN \
A light snow was falling. Bran could feel the flakes on his face, melting as they touched his skin like the gentlest of rains. He sat straight atop his horse, watching
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as the iron portcullis was winched upward. Try as he might to keep calm, his he
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rt was fluttering in his chest. \
\'93Are you ready?\'94 Robb asked. \
Bran nodded, trying not to let his fear show. He had not been outside Winterfell since his fall, but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight. \
\'93Let\'92s ride, then.\'94 Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding, and the horse w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lked under the portcullis. \
\'93Go,\'94 Bran whispered to his own horse. He touched her 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 eck lightly, and the small chestnut filly started forward. Bran had named her Dancer. She was two years old, and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be. They had trained her special, to respond to rein and voice and t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uch. Up to now, Bran had only ridden her around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit. \
They passed beneath the gat
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 house, over the drawbridge, through the outer walls. Summer and Grey Wind came loping besi
\f3 de t
\f1 hem, sniffing at the wind. Close behind came Theon Greyjoy, w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had a mind to take a deer, he had told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Joseth, a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up the rear, riding on a 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 onkey. Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just the two of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed him. If Bran fell off his horse or injured himself, the maester was determined to be with him. \
Beyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 eserted now. They rode down the muddy streets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 one. Less than one in five were occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from \
their chimneys. The rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder. When the snow
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fell and the ice winds how
\f3 led down out of the no
\f1 rth, Old Nan said, farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their wagons, and then the winter town came alive. Bran had never seen it happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer. The end of the long summer was near at hand. Winter is coming. \
A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk had grown used to
\f3  the sight
\f1 . They bent the knee when they saw the boys, and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod. \
With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first, but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly, and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall. After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural. His anxiety faded, and a tremulous smile crept across his face. \
Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the local alehouse. When Theon Greyjoy called out to t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em, the younger girl turned red and covered her face. Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. \'93Sweet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Kyra,\'94 he said with a laugh. \'93She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and Bessa\'97\'94 \
\'93Not where my brother can hear, Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 on,\'94 Robb warned him with a glance at Bran. \
Bran looked away and pretended not to have 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eard, but he could feel Greyjoy\'92s eyes on him. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company, but Bran had never warmed to his father\'92s ward. \
Robb rode closer. \'93You are doing well, Bran.\'94 \'93I want t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  go faster,\'94 Bran replied. \
Robb smiled. \'93As you will.\'94 He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced after him. Bran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him. \
Bran\'92s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face. Robb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were following. He snapped the reins again. Smooth as silk, Dancer slid into a gallop. The distance closed. By the time he caught Robb on the edge of the \
wolfswood,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 two miles beyond the winter town, they had left the others well behind. \'93I can ride!\'94 Bran shouted, grinning. It felt al
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ost as good as flying. \
\'93I\'92d race you, but I fear yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 \'92d win.\'94 Robb\'92s tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile. \
\'93I don\'92t w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nt to race.\'94 Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had vanished into the wood. \'93Did you hear Summer howling last night?\'94 \
\'93Grey Wind was restless too,\'94 R
\f3 obb sa
\f1 id. His auburn hair had grow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  shaggy and unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen years. \'93Sometimes I think they know things . . . sense things . . . \'94 Robb sighed. \'93I never know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you were ol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 er.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m eight now!\'94 Bran said. \'93Eight isn\'92t so much younger than fifteen, and I\'92m the heir to Winterfell, after you.\'94 \
\'93So you are.\'94 Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. \'93Bran, I need to tell you some
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hing. There was a bird last night. From King\'92s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me.\'94 \
Bran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the messenger ravens had be
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the Night\'92s Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing. Then a message had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but that had not been good news either. She did not s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y when she meant to return, only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sor
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  of liked the little man, yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the Lannisters, something he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone. Ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 b spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, riders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb\'92s commands throughout the north. Bran heard talk of Moat Cai
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 in, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top of the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good. \
And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \'93Was the bird from Mother? Is she coming home?\'94 \
\'93The message was from Alyn in King\'92s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and Heward as well. Murdered by the Kingslayer.\'94 Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the flakes melted on his cheeks. \'93May the gods give them rest.\'94 \
Bran did not know what to say. He felt as if he\'92d been punched. Jory had been
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 captain of \
the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. \'93They killed Jory?\'94 He remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs. He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and pl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 te, or sitting at his accustomed pla
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. \'93Why would anyone kill Jory?\'94 \
Robb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. \'93
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  don\'92t know, and . . . Bran, that\'92s not the worst 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f it. Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight. Alyn says his leg was shattered, and . . . Maester Pycelle has
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 given him the milk of the poppy, but they aren\'92t sure when . . . when he . . .\'94 The sound of hoofbeats 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ade him glance down the road, to where Theon and the others were coming up. \'93When he 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ill wake,\'94 Robb finished. He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then, and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord. \'93Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be forgotten.\'94 \
Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful. \'93What will you do?\'94 he asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them. \
\'93Theon thinks I should call the banners,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93Blood for blood.\'94 For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  hungry look to it, and black hair fell down across his eyes. \
\'93Only the lord can call the banners,\'94 Bran said as the snow drifted down around them. \'93If your father dies,\'94 Theon said, \'93Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.\'94\
\'93He won\'92t 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ie!\'94 Bran screamed at him. \
Robb took his hand. \'93He won\'92t die, not Father,\'94 he said calmly. \'93Still . . . the honor of the north is in my hand
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he told me to be strong for you and for Rickon. I\'92m almost a man grown, Bran
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Bran shivered. \'93I wish Mother was back,\'94 he said miserably. He looked around for Maester Luwin; his donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise. \'93Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too?\'94 \
\'93The maester is timid as an old woman,\'94 said Theon.\
\'93Father always listened to his counsel,\'94 Bran reminded his brother. \'93Mother too.\'94 \'93I listen to him,\'94 Robb insisted. \'93I listen to everyone.\'94 \
The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on his face. Not so long ago, the thought of Ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 b calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement, but now he felt only dread. \'93Can we go back now?\'94 he asked. \'93I\'92m cold.\'94 \
Robb glanced around. \'93We need
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit longer?\'94 \
\'93I can go as long as you can.\'94 Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short, for fear of saddle sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother. He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was. \
\'93Let\'92s hunt down the hun
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ers, then,\'94 Robb said. Side by side, they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood. Theon d
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 opped back and followed well behind them, talking and joking with the guardsmen. \
It was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went. He knew this wood, but
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time. The smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine needles, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  earthy odor of wet rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires. He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider. \

\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 heon and the others fell farther and farther
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 behind, until Bran could no longer hear their voices. From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It grew louder until they reached the stream. Tears stung his eyes. \
\'93Bran?\'94 Robb asked. \'93What\'92s wrong?\'94 \
Bran shook his head. \'93I was just remembering,\'94 he said. \'93Jory brought us here once, to fish for trout. You and me and Jon. Do you remember?\'94 \
\'93I remember,\'94 Robb said, his voice quiet and sad. \
\'93I didn\'92t catch anything,\'94 Bran said, \'93but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfe
\f3 ll. Will we ever see Jon
\f1  again?\'94 \
\'93We saw Uncle Benjen when
\f3  the king came to visit,\'94 Robb pointed out. \'93Jon will visit too, you\'92ll see.\'94 \
The stream was running high and fast. Robb
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dismounted and led his gelding across the \
ford. In the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 deepest part of the crossing, the water came up to midthigh. He tied his horse to a tree on the far side, and waded back across for Bran and Dancer. The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could feel the spray on his 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace as Robb led him over. It made him
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 smile. For a moment he felt strong again, and whole. He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up to the very top, with the whole forest sprea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  out beneath him. \
They were on the far side when they heard the howl, a long rising wail that moved through the 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 rees like a cold wind. Bran raised his head to listen. \'93Summer,\'94 he said. No sooner had he spoken than a sec
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nd voice joined the first. \
\'93They\'92ve made a kill,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Robb said as he remounted. \'93I\'92d best go and bring them back. Wait here, Theon and the others should be along 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hortly.\'94 \
\'93I want to go with you,\'94 Bran said.\
\'93I\'92ll find them faster by myself.\'94 R
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 bb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees. \
Once he was gone, the 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 oods seemed to close in around Bran. The snow was falling more heavily now. Where it touched the ground it 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 elted, but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white. As he waited, he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging useless in the stirrups
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin and Joseth and the rest. \
When he heard the rustle of leaves, Br
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n used the reins to make Dancer turn, expecting to see his friends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers. \
\'93Good day to you,\'94 he said nervously. One look, and Bran knew they were neither foresters nor farmers. He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed. His surcoat wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  new, dark grey wool with silver buttons, and a heavy silver pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  shoulders. His boots and gloves were lined with fur as well. \
\'93All alone, are you?\'94 said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw windburnt face. \'93Lost in the wolfswood, poor lad.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not lost.\'94 Bran did not like the way the strangers 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ere looking at him. He counted four, but when he turned 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is head, he saw two others behind him. \'93My brother rode off just a moment ago, and my guard will be here
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shortly.\'94 \
\'93Your guard, is it?\'94 a second man said. Grey stubble covered his gaunt face. \'93And what would they be guarding, my little lord? Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak?\'94 \
\'93Pretty,\'94 said a woman\'92s voice. She scarcely 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ooked like a woman; tall and lean, with the same hard face as the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm. The spear she held was eight feet of black oak, tipped in rusted steel. \
\'93Let\'92s have a look,\'94 said the big bald man
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
Bran watched him anxiously. The man\'92s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to pieces, patched here with brow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  and here with blue and there with a dark green, and faded everywhere to grey, but once that cloak might have been black. The grey stubbly man wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start. Suddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf pups; that man had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night\'92s Watch. No man is more da
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 gerous, he remembered Lord Eddard saying. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile or crue
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 . \
\'93The pin, l
\f3 ad,\'94 the bi
\f1 g man said. He held out his hand. \
\'93We\'92ll take the horse too,\'94 said another of them, a woman shorter than Robb, with a broad fiat face and lank yellow hair. \'93Get down, and be quick about it.\'94 A knife slid from her sleeve into her hand, its edge jagged as a saw. \
\'93No,\'94 Bran blurted. \'93I can\'92t . . . \'94 \
The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off. \'93You can, lordling . . . and will, if you know what\'92s good for you.\'94 \
\'93Stiv, look how he\'92s strapped on.\'94 The tall woman pointed with her spear. \'93Might be it\'92s the truth he\'92s telling.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Straps, is it?\'94 Stiv said. He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt. \'93There\'92s ways to deal with straps.\'94 \
\'93You some kind of cripple?\'94 asked the short woman. \
Bran flared. \'93I\'92m Brandon Stark of Winterfell, and you better let go of my horse, or I\'92ll see you all dead.\'94 \
The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed. \'93The boy\'92s a Stark, true eno
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 gh. \
Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.\'94 \
\'93Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth,\'94 suggested the short woman. \'93That should shut him up.\'94 \
\'93You\'92re as stupid as you are ugly, Hali,\'94 said the tall woman. \'93The boy\'92s worth nothing dead, but alive . . . gods be damned, think what Mance would give to have Benjen Stark\'92s own blood to hostage!\'94 \
\'93Mance be damned,\'94 the big man cursed. \'93You want to go back there, Osha? More fool you. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ink the white walkers will care if you have a hostage?\'94 He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around his thigh. The leather parted with a sigh. \
The stroke had been quick and careless, biting deep. Looking down, Bran glimpsed pale flesh where the wool of his leggings had parted. Then the blood began to flow. He watched the red s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ain spread, feeling light-headed, curiously apart; there had been no pain, not even a hint of feeling. The big man grunted in surprise. \
\'93Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death,\'94 Robb called out. \
Bran looked up in desperate hope, and there he was. The strength of the words were undercut by the way his voice cracked with strain. He was mounted, the bloody carc
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ss of an elk slung across the back of his horse, his sword in a gloved hand. \
\'93The brother,\'94 said t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e man with the grey stubbly face. \
\'93He\'92s a fierce one, he is,\'94 mocked the short woman. Hali, they called her. \'93You mean to fight us, boy?\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t be a fool, lad. You\'92re one against six.\'94 The tall woman, Osha, leveled her spear. \'93Off the horse, and throw down the sword. We\'92ll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison, and you and your brother can be on your way.\'94 \
Robb whistled. They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet lea
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 es. The undergrowth parted, low-hanging
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 branches giving up their accumulation of snow, and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from the green. Summer sniffed the air and growled. \
\'93Wolves,\'94 gasped Hali.\
\'93Direwolves,\'94 Bran said. Still half-grown, the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  were as large as any wolf he had ever \
seen, but the differences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught him. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrib
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e about them as they stood there amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spo
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ted Grey Wind\'92s muzzle. \
\'93Dogs,\'94 the big bald man said contemptuously. \'93Yet I\'92m told there\'92s nothing like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night.\'94 He made a sharp gesture. \'93Take them.\'94 \
Robb shouted, \'93Winterfell!\'94 and kicked his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 horse. The gelding plunged down the bank as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the ragged men closed. A
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 man wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  an axe rushed in, shouting and heedless. Robb\'92s sword c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood. The man with the gaunt st
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 bbly face made a grab for the reins, and f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r half a second he had them . . . an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  
\f3 the
\f1 n Grey Wind was on him, bearing him down. He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout, flailing wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 dly with his knife as his head went under. The direwolf plunged in after him, and the white water turned red where they had vanished. \
Robb and Osha matched blows in mi
\f3 dstream. Her
\f1  l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng spe
\f3 ar was
\f1  a steel-headed serpent, flashing out at his chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried every thrust with his longsword, turning the point aside. On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall wom
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n overextended herself and lost her balance, just for a second. Robb charged, riding her down. \
A few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his flank. 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 ummer slid away, snarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws closed around her calf. Holding the knife with both hands, the small woman stabb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d down, but the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming. He pulled free for an instant, his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled and fell, he came at her again, slamming her backward, teeth tearing at her belly. \
The sixth man ran from the carnage . . . but not far. As he went scrambling up the far side of the bank, Grey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet. He shook the wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er off and bounded after the running man, hamstringing
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him with a single snap of his teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water. \
And then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv. He slashed at Bran\'92s chest strap, grabbed his arm, and yanked. Suddenly Bran was falling. He sprawled on the ground, his legs ta
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 gled under him, one foot in the stream. He could not feel the cold of the water, but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to his th
\f3 roa
\f1 t. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Back away,\'94 the man warned, \'93or I\'92ll open the boy\'92s windpipe
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  I swear it.\'94 \
Robb reined his horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and his sword arm dropped. \
In that moment Bran saw everything. Summer was sav
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ging Hali, pulling glistening blue snakes from her belly. Her eyes were wide and staring. Bran could not tell whether she was alive or dead. The 
\f3 grey
\f1  stubbly man
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and the one with the axe lay unmoving, but Osha was on her knees, crawling toward her fallen spear. Grey 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 ind padded toward her, dripping wet. \'93Call him off!\'94 the big man shouted. \'93Call them both off, or the crippl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  boy dies now!\'94 \
\'93Grey Wind, Summer, to me,\'94 Robb said. \
The direwolves stopped, turned their heads. Grey Wind loped back to Robb. Summer stayed where he was, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him. He growled. His muzzle was wet and red, but his eyes burned. \
Osha used the butt end of he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  spear to lever herself back to her feet. Blood leaked from a wound on the upper arm where Robb had cut her. 
\f2\fs24 B
\f1\fs28 ran could see sweat trickling down the big man\'92s face. Stiv was as scared as he was, he realized. \'93Starks,\'94 the man muttered, \'93bloody Starks.\'94 He raised his voice. \'93Osha, kill th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  wolves and get his sword.\'94 \
\'93Kill them yourself,\'94 she replied. \'93I\'92ll not be getting near those monsters.\'94 \
For a moment Stiv was at a loss. His h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed against his neck. The stench of the man filled his nose; he smelled of fear. \'93You,\'94 he called out to Robb. \'93You have a name?\'94 \
\'93I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.\'94 \
\'93This is 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 our brother?\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 \
\'93You want him alive, you do what I say. Off the horse.\'94 \
Robb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with his sword in hand. \
\'93Now kill the wolves.\'94 Robb did not move. \
\'93You do it. The wolves or th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  boy.\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 Bran screamed. If Robb did as they 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 sked, Stiv would kill them both anyway, once the direwolves were dead. \
The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Br
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n sobbed in pain. \'93You shut your mouth, cripp
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e, you hear me?\'94 He twisted harder. \'93You hear me?\'94 \
A low thrum came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest. The arrow was bright red, as if it had been painted in blood. \
The dagger fell away from Bran\'92s throat. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e big man swayed and collaps
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, facedown in the stream. The arrow broke beneath him. Bran watched his life go swirling off in the wate
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . \
Osha glanced around as Father\'92s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees, steel in hand. She threw down her spear. \'93Mercy, m\'92lord,\'94 she called
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to Robb. \
The guardsmen had a strange, pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of slaughter. They eyed the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali\'92s corpse to
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 feed, Jos\cf2 et\cf3 h dropped his knif\cf2 e \cf3 and s
\f2 \cf2 c
\f1 \cf3 rambled f\cf2 or\cf3  the bush, heaving\cf2 . \cf3 Even 
\f2 \cf2 M
\f0\b\fs38 aester 
\f2\b0\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 uwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree, but only for an instant. Then he shook his head a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d waded across the stream to Bran\'92s side. \'93Are you hurt?\'94 \
\'93He cut my leg,\'94 Bran said, \'93but I couldn\'92t feel it.\'94 \
As the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned his head. Theon Greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever smiling. A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet, but it had taken only 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne. \'93A dead enemy is a thing of beauty,\'94 he announced.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,\'94 Robb said loudly. \'93I ought to chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at you.\'94 \
\'93You should be thanking me for saving your brother\'92s life.\'94 \
\'93What if you had missed the shot?\'94 Robb said. \'93W
\f3 hat 
\f1 if you\'92d only wounded him? What if yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  had made his hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, the man might \
have been
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of his cloak. What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever think of that, Greyjoy
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Theon\'92s smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground, one by one. \
Robb glared at his guardsmen. \'93Where were you?\'94 he demanded of them. \'93I was sure you were close behi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d us.\'94 \
The men traded unhappy glances. \'93We were following, m\'92lord,\'94 said Quent, the youngest of them, his beard a soft brown fuzz. \'93Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were . . . \'94 He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed. \
\'93I spied a turkey,\'94 Theon said, annoyed by the question. \'93How was I to know that you\'92d leave the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 boy alone?\'94 \
Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so angry, yet he said nothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. \'93How badly is my brother wounded?\'94 \
\'93No more than a scratch,\'94 the maester 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut. \'93Two of them wear the black,\'94 he told Ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 b as he worked. \
R
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 bb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it. \'93Deserters from the Night\'92s Watch,\'94 he said grimly. \'93They must have been fools, to come so close to Winterfell.\'94 \
\'93Folly and desperati
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n are ofttimes hard to tell apart,\'94 said Maester Luwin. \'93Shall we bury them, m\'92lord?\'94 asked Quent. \
\'93They would not have buried us,\'94 Robb said. \'93Hack off their heads, we\'92ll send them back to the Wall. Leave the rest for the carrion crows.\'94 \
\'93And this one?\'94 Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha. \
Robb walked over to her. She was a head taller than he was, but she dropped to her knees at his approach. \'93Give me my life, m\'92lord of Stark, and I am yours.\'94 \
\'93Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?\'94 \
\'93I broke no oaths. Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall, not me. The blac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  crows got no place for women.\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer. \'93Give her to the wolves,\'94 he urged Robb. The woman\'92s eyes went to what was left of Hali, and just as quickl
\f3 y away
\f1 . She shuddered. Even the guardsmen looked queasy. \
\'93She\'92s a woman,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93A wildling,\'94 Bran told him. \'93She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance Rayder.\'94 \
\'93Do you have a name?\'94 Robb asked her.\
\'93Osha, as it please t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e lord,\'94 she muttered sourly. Maester Luwin stood. \'93We might do well to question her.\'94 \

TYRION \
You want eat?\'94 Mord asked, glowering. He had a plate of oiled beans in one thick, stub- fingered hand. \
Tyrion Lannister was starved, but he refused to let this brute see him cringe. \'93A leg of lamb would be pleasant,\'94 he said, from the heap of soiled straw in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  corner of his cell. \'93Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked bread with b
\f3 utter,
\f1  and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if that\'92s easier. I try not to be overly particular.\'94 \
\'93Is beans,\'94 Mord said. \'93Here.\'94 He held out the plate. \
Tyrion sighed. The turnkey was twenty stone of gro
\f2\fs24 s
\f3\fs28 s stupidity,
\f1  with brown rotting teeth and small dark eyes. The left side of his face was slick with scar wher
\f3 e an axe had cut of
\f1 f his ear and part of his cheek. He was as predictable as he was ugly, but Tyrion was hungry. He reached up for the pla
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e. \
Mord jerked it away, grinning. \'93Is here,\'94 he said, holding it out beyond Tyrion\'92s reach. \
The dwarf climbed stiffly 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o his feet, every joint aching. \'93Must we play the same fool\'92s game with every meal?\'94 He made another grab for the beans. \
Mord shambled backward, grinning through his rotten teeth. \'93Is here, dwarf man.\'94 He held the plate out at arm\'92s length, over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93You not want eat? Here. Come take.\'94 \
Tyrion\'92s arms were too short to reach the plate, and he was not about to step that close to the edge. All it 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould take
\f3  woul
\f1 d be a quick shove of Mord\'92s heavy white 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 elly, and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky, like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries. \'93Come to think on it, I\'92m not hungry after all,\'94 he declared, retreating to the corner of his cell. \
M
\f3 ord grunted and opened his th
\f1 ic
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping it over as i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  fell. A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight. The turnkey laughed, his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding. \
Tyrion felt a pang of rage. \'93You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass,\'94 he spat. \'93I hope you die \
of a bloody flux.\'94 \
For that, Mord gave him a kick, driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion\'92s ribs on the way out. \'93I take it back!\'94 he gasped as he doubled over on the straw. \'93I\'92ll kill you myself, I swear it!\'94 The heavy iron-bound doo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  slammed shut. Tyrion heard the rattle of keys. \
For a small man, he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, he reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon. He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding, staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever, wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he\'92d won from Marillion a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  dice, after the singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood and mold, but it was warm and thick. Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . \
The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons. His cell was miserably small, even for a dwarf. Not five feet away, where a wall ought to have been, where a wall would be in a proper dungeon, the floor ended and the sky began. He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the bowels of the Casterly Rock. \
\'93You fly,\'94 Mord had promised him, when
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he\'92d shoved him into the cell. \'93Twenty day, thirty, fifty maybe. Then you fly.\'94 \
The Ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 yns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will. That first day, after girding up
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his courage for hours, Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge, to poke out his head and look down. Sky was six hundred feet below, with nothing between but empty air. If he craned his neck ou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  as far as it could go, he could see other cells to his right and left and above him. He was a bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had torn off his wings. \
It was cold in the cell, the wind screamed night and day, and worst of all, the floor 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 loped. Ever so slightly, yet it was enough. He was afraid to close his eyes, afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge. Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad. \
Gods save me, some previous tenant had writt
\f3 en on the 
\f1 wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood, the blue is calling.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 At first Tyrion wondered who he\'92d been, and what had become of him; later, he decided that he would r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ther not know. \
If only he had shut his mouth . . .\
The
\f3  wre
\f1 tched boy had started it, looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood \
beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of H
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 use Arryn. Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life, but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the hei
\f3 ght
\f1  of a man. \'93Is he the bad man?\'94 the boy
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had asked, clutching his doll. \
\'93He is,\'94 the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him. She was all in blue, powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court. \
\'93He\'92s so small,\'94 the Lord of the Eyrie said, giggling. \
\'93This is Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister, who murdered your f
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ther.\'94 She raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars, so every man could hear it. \'93He slew the Ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d of the King!\'94 \
\'93Oh, did I kill him too?\'94 Tyrion had said, like a fool. \
That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed. He co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld see that now; seven hells, he had seen it then. The High Hall of the Arryns wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble, but the fac
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s around him had been colder by far. The pow
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r of Casterly Rock was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of Arryn. Submission and silence would have been his best defenses. \
But Tyrion\'92s mood had been too foul for sense. To his shame, he had faltered during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to take him any higher. Bronn had carried him the rest of the way, and the humiliation poured oil on the 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 lames of his anger. \'93It wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d seem I\'92ve been a busy little fellow,\'94 he said with bitter sarcasm. \'93I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and murdering.\'94 \
He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with. Lysa Arryn and her half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit, especially when it was directed at them. \
\'93Imp,\'94 Lysa said coldly, \'93you will g
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely, or I promise you will have cause to regret it. Remember where you are. This is the Eyrie, and these are knights of the Vale you see around you, true men who loved Jon Arryn well. Every one of them would die for me.\'94 \
\'93Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do.\'94 Even as he spat out the words, Tyrion knew they were folly. \
\'93Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?\'94 Lady Lysa asked. \'93Does a dwarf have wings? If not, \
you would be wiser to swall
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w the next threat that comes to mind.\'94 \'93I made no threats,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93That was a promise.\'94 \
Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that, so upset he dropped his doll. \'93You can\'92t hurt us,\'94 he screamed. \'93No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mother, tell him he can\'92t hurt us here.\'94 The boy began to twitch. \
\'93The Eyrie is impregnable,\'94 Lysa Arryn declared calmly. She drew her son close, holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms. \'93The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet baby. The Lannisters are 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll liars. No one will hurt my sweet boy.\'94 \
The hell of it was, she was no doubt right. Having seen what it took to get here, Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor, while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for e
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ery step. Nightmare did not begin to describe it. Small wonder the Eyrie had never been taken. \
Still, Tyrion had been unable to silence himself. \'93Not impregnable,\'94 he said, \'93merely inconvenient.\'94 \
Young Robert pointed down, his hand trembling. \'93You\'92re a li
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r. Mother, I want to see him fly.\'94 Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, lifting him off hi
\f3 s flo
\f1 or. \
The gods only know what might 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave happened then wer
\f3 e it n
\f1 ot for Catelyn Stark. \'93Sister,\'94 she called out from where she stood below the thrones, \'93I beg you to remember, this man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.\'94 \
Lysa Arryn glanced at 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on Tyrion, her long skirts trailing after her. For an instant he feared she would strike him, but instead she commanded them to release him. Her men shoved him to the floor, his legs went out from under him, and Tyrion 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ell. \
He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees, only to feel his right leg spasm, sending him sprawling once more. Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall o
\f3 f the
\f1  Arryns. \
\'93My 
\f3 sister\'92s little guest is t
\f1 oo weary to stand,\'94 Lady Lysa announced. \'93Ser Vardis, take him down to the dungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
The guardsmen jerked him upright. Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, kicking \
feebly, his face red with shame. \'93I will remember this,\'94 he 
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 old them all as they carried 
\f1 him off. \
And so he did, for all the good it did him. \
At first he h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long. Lysa Arryn wanted to humble him, that was all. She would send for him again, and soon. If not her, then Catelyn Stark would want to question him
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  This time he would guard his tongue more closely. They dare not kill him 
\f3 out of
\f1  hand; he was still a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and if they shed his blood, it would mean war. Or so he had told himself. \
Now he was not so certain. \
Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long. He was growing weaker every day, and it w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s only a matter of time until Mord\'92s kicks and blows did him serious harm, provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first. A few more nights of cold and hunger, and the blue would start calling to him too. \
He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his cell. Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him. Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even now . . . unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead. Did
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 anyone outside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Cersei would do when she heard. The kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f3\fs28  could order him free
\f1 d, but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand? Tyrion had no i
\f3 llusions about the king\'92s love for his sister. \
If C
\f1 ersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself. Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor of the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see. Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the lords of the land. It would be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that . . . \
Tyrion Lannister sighed. His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but her pride blinded 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er. She would see the ins
\f2\fs24 u
\f3\fs28 lt in this, not 
\f1 the opportunity. And Jaime was even worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword. \
He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and whether they had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had been murdered, it was deftly and subtly done. Men of his age died of sudden illness all the time. In \
contrast, sending some oaf with a 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tolen knife after Brandon Stark struck him as unbelievably clumsy. And wasn\'92t that peculiar, come to think on it . . . \
Tyrion shivered. Now there was a nasty sus
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 icion. Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the w
\f3 oods, and if that was true, someone was using him
\f1  as a catspaw. Tyrion Lannister hated being used. \
He would have to get out of here, and soon. His chan
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 es of overpowering Mord were small to none, and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope, so he would have to talk himself free. His mouth had gotten him into this cell; it could damn well get him out. \
Tyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ign
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re the slope of the floor beneath him, with its ev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r-so-subtle tug toward the edge. He hammered on the door with a fist. \'93Mord!\'94 he shouted. \'93Turnkey! Mord, I want you!\'94 He had to keep it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps. Tyrion stepped back an instant before the door opened with a cra
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 h. \

\f3 \'93Maki
\f1 ng noise,\'94 Mord growled, with blood in his eyes. Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap, wide and thick, doubled over in his fist. \
Never show them you\'92re afraid, Tyrion reminded himself. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 How would you like to be rich?\'94 he asked. \
Mord hit him. He swung the strap backhand, lazily, but the leather caught Tyrion high on the arm. The force of it staggered him, and the pain made him grit his tee
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h. \'93No mouth, dwarf man,\'94 Mord warned him. \
\'93Gold,\'94 Tyrion said, miming a smile. \'93Casterly Rock is full of gold . . . ahhhh . . . \'94 This time the blow was a forehand, and Mord put more of his arm into the swing, maki
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g the leather crack and jump. It caught Tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees, wimpering. He forced himself to look up at the gaoler
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93As rich as the Lannisters,\'94 he wheezed. \'93That\'92s what they say, Mord\'97\'94 \
Mord grunted. The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face. The pain was so bad he did not remember falling, but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell. His ear was 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 inging, and his mouth was full of blood. He groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed against . . . nothing. Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had bee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  scalded, and tried his best to stop breathing. He had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fall
\f3 en ri
\f1 ght on the edge, inches from the blue. \
\'93More to say?\'94 Mord held the strap between
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his fists and gave it a sharp pull. The snap \

\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ade Tyrion jump. The turnkey laughed. \
He won\'92t push me over, Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge. Catelyn Stark wants me alive, he doesn\'92t dare kill me. He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand, grinned, and said, \'93That was a stiff one, Mord.\'94 The gaoler squinted at him, trying to decide if he was being mocke
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . \'93I could make good use of a strong man like you.\'94 The strap flew at him, but this time Tyrion was able to cringe away from it. He took a glancing blow to the shoulder, nothing more. \'93Gold,\'94 he repeated, scrambling backward like a crab, \'93more gold than you\'92ll see here in a lifetime. Enough to buy land, women, horses . . . you could be a lord. Lord Mord.\'94 Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky. \
\'93Is no gold,\'94 Mord said. \
He\'92s listening! Tyrion thought. \'93They relieved me of my purse when they captured me, but the gold is still mine. Catelyn Stark might tak
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  a man prisoner, but she\'92d never stoop to rob him. That wouldn\'92t be honorabl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 . Help me, and all the gold is yours.\'94 Mord\'92s strap licked out, but it was a halfhearted, desultory swing, slow and contemptuous. Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned. \'93There will be no risk to you. All you need do is deliver a message.\'94 \
The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion\'92s grasp. \'93Message,\'94 he said, as if he had never heard the word before. His frown made deep creases in his brow. \
\'93You heard me, my lord. Only carry my word to your lady. Tell her . . . \'94 What? What would possibly make Lysa Anyn re
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ent? The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister suddenly. \'93 . . . .tell her that I wish to confess my crimes.\'94 \
Mord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow, but the turnkey hesitated. Suspicion and greed warred in his eyes. He wanted that gold, yet he feared a trick; he had the look of a man who had often been tricked. \'93Is lie,\'94 he muttered darkly. \'93Dw
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rf man cheat me.\'94 \
\'93I will put my promise in writing,\'94 Tyrion vowed. \
Some illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word, as if it were some s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rt of magic. Fortunately, Mord was one of the latter. The turnkey lowered the strap. \'93Writing down gold. Much
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gold.\'94 \
\'93Oh, much gold,\'94 Tyrion assured him. \'93The purse is just a taste, my friend. My brother wears armor of solid gold plate.\'94 In t
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 uth, Jaime\'92s armor was gilded steel, but this oaf would never know the difference. \
Mord fingered his strap thoughtfully, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f3\fs28 ut in the end, he relent
\f1 ed and went to fetch paper and ink. When the letter was written, the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously. \'93Now deliver my message,\'94 Tyrion urged. \
He was shivering in his sleep when they came for him, late that night. Mord opened the door but kept his silence. Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of his boot. \'93On your feet, Imp. My lady wants to see you.\'94 \
Tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt. \'93No doubt she does, but what makes you think I wish to see her?\'94 \
Ser Vardis frowned. Tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t
\f3  at King
\f1 \'92s Landing as the captain of the Hand\'92s household guard. A square, plain face, silver hair, a heavy bu
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ld, and no humor whatsoever. \'93Your wishes are not my concern. On your feet
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  or I\'92ll have you carried.\'94 \
Tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet. \'93A cold night,\'94 he said casually, \'93and the High Hall is so drafty. I don\'92t wish to catch a chill. Mord, if
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you would be so good, fetch my 
\f3 cloak.
\f1 \'94 \
The gaoler squinted at him, face dull with suspicion. \
\'93My c
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 oak,\'94 Tyrion repeated. \'93The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping. You recall.\'94 \
\'93Get him the damnable cloak,\'94 Ser Vardis said. \
Mord did not dare grumble. He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet he went for the cloak. Whe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  he 
\f3 drape
\f1 d it around his prisoner\'92s neck, Tyrion smiled. \'93My thanks. I shall think of you whenever I wear it.\'94 He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the first time in days. \'93Lead on, Ser Vardis.\'94 \
The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning in the sconces along the walls. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls. S
\f3 ince she did not
\f1  look the sort to join the Night\'92s Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mour
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ing clothes were appropriate garb for a confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell across her left shoulder. The taller throne beside her was empty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep. Tyrion was thankful for that much, at least. \
He bo
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall. Lady Arryn had \
summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped. He saw Ser Brynden Tully\'92s craggy face and Lord Nestor Royce\'92s bluff one. Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 side-whiskers who could only be his heir, Ser Albar. Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented. Tyrion noted Ser Lyn Corbray, slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the widowed Lady Waynwood surrounded by her sons. Others sported sigils he did not know; broken lance, green viper, burning tower, winged chalice. \
Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road; Ser Rodrik Cassel, pale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beside him. Marillion the singer had found a new woodharp. Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far. \
In the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar. The freerider\'92s black eyes were fixed on Tyrion, and his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword. Tyrion gave him a long look, wondering . . . \
Catelyn Stark spoke first. \'93You wish to confess
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 your crimes, we are told.\'94 \'93I do, my lady,\'94 Tyrion answered. \
Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister. \'93The sky cells always break them. The gods can see them there, and there is no da
\f3 rkness to hide in.\'94 \
\'93He does 
\f1 not look broken to me,\'94 Lady Catelyn said.\
Lady Lysa paid her no mind. \'93Say what you will,\'94 she 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ommanded Tyrion. \
And now to roll the dice, he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn. \'93Where to begin? I am a vile little man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting, my lords and ladies. I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 have lain with whores, not once but hundreds of times. I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our gracious queen, as well.\'94 Behind him, someone chuckled. \'93I have not always treated my servants with kindness. I have gambled. I have even cheated, I blush to admit. I have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court.\'94 That drew outright laughter. \'93
\f2\fs24 O
\f1\fs28 nce I\'97\'94 \
\'93Silence!\'94 Lysa Arryn\'92s pale round face had turned a burning pink. \'93What do you imagine you are doing, d
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 arf?\'94 \
Tyrion cocked his head to one side. \'93Why, confessing my crimes, my lady\'97\'94 \
Catelyn Stark took a step forward. \'93You are accused of sending a hired k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ife to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.\'94 \
Tyrion gave
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a helpless shrug. \'93Those crimes I cannot confess, I fear. I know nothing of any murders.\'94 \
Lady Lysa rose from her weirwood
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 throne. \'93I will not be made mock of. You have had your little jape, Imp. I trust you enjoyed it. Ser Vardis, take him back to the\
dungeon . . . but this time find him a smaller
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cell, with a floor more sharply sloped.\'94 \
\'93Is this how justice is done in the Vale?\'94 Tyrion roared, so loudly that Ser Vardis froze for an instant. \'93Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate? You accuse me
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve.\'94 He lifted his head, to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on his face. \'93Where is the king\'92s justice? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms? I stand accused, you say. Very well. I demand a trial! Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly, in the sigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  of gods and men.\'94 \
A low murmuring filled the High Hall. He had her, Tyrion knew. He was highborn, the son of the most powerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. He could not be denied a trial. Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid them halt an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  loo
\f3 ked to La
\f1 dy Lysa. \
Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile. \'93If you are tried and foun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the king\'92s own laws, you must pay with your life\'92s bloo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . We keep no headsman in the Eyrie, my lord of Lannister. Open the Moon Door.\'94 \
The press of spectators parted. A narrow weirwood door stood between two slender marble pillars, a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 crescent moon carved in the white wood. Those standing closest edged backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through. One man removed the heavy bronze bars; the second pulled the door inward. Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their sh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ulders, caug
\f3 ht in t
\f1 he sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door. Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with cold uncaring stars. \
\'93
\f2\fs24 B
\f1\fs28 ehold the king\'92s justice,\'94 Lysa Arryn said. Torch flames fluttered like pennons along the walls, and here and there the odd torch guttered out. \
\'93Lysa, I think this unwise,\'94 Catelyn St
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rk said as the black wind swirled around the hall. Her sister ignored her. \'93You want a trial, my lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1 \cf3  of Lanni\cf2 st\cf3 er. Very well, a t\cf2 ri\cf3 al yo
\f2 \cf2 u
\f1 \cf3  shall \
\cf2 ha\cf3 ve. My son will li\cf2 st\cf3 en to
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 whateve
\f2\b0\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  you care to say, and you shall hear his judgment. Then you may leave . . . by one door or the other.\'94 \
She looked
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How could a trial threaten her, when her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door. Mother, I want to see him fly! the boy had said. How many men had the snot- nosed little wretch sent through that door already? \
\'93I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,\'94 Tyrion said politely. \'93The gods know the truth of my innocence. I will have their verdict, not the judgment of men. I demand trial by
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 combat.\'94 \
A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns. Lord Nestor Royce snorted, Ser Willis chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces. Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand. Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door. \
Lysa Arryn\'92s watery blue eyes looked uncertain. He had caught her off balance. \'93You have that right, to be sure.\'94 \
The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one knee. \'93My lady, I beg the boon of championing your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cause.\'94 \
\'93The honor should be mine,\'94 old Lord Hunter
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said. \'93For the love I bore your lord husba
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d, let me avenge his death.\'94 \
\'93My father served Lord 
\f2\fs24 J
\f1\fs28 on faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,\'94 Ser Albar Royce boomed. \'93Let me serve his son in this.\'94 \
\'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  gods favor the man with the just cause,\'94 said Ser Lyn Corbray, \'93yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 word. We all know who that is.\'94 He smiled modestly. \
A dozen other men all spoke at once, clamoring to be heard. Tyrion found it disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill him. Perhaps this had no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  been such a clever plan after all. \
Lady Lysa raised 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  hand for silence. \'93I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he were among us. No men in the Seven King
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 oms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale. W
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld that I could grant you all this honor. Yet I can choose only one.\'94 She gestured. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Ser Vardis Egen, you were ever my lord husband\'92s goo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  right hand. You shall be our champion.\'94 \
S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Vardis had been singularly silent. \'93My lady,\'94 he said gravely, sinking to one knee, \'93pray gi
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e this burden to another, I have no taste for it. The man is no warrior. Look at him. A dwarf, half my size and lame in the legs. It would be shameful to slaughter such 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  man and call it justice.\'94 \
Oh, excellent, Tyrion thought. \'93I agree.\'94\
Lysa glared at him. \'93You demanded a trial by combat.\'94 \
\'93And now I dema
\f3 nd a ch
\f1 ampion, such as you have chosen for yourself. My brother Jaime will gladly take my part, I know.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 Y
\f1\fs28 our precious Kingslayer is hundreds 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f leagues from here,\'94 snapped Lysa Arryn. \'93Send a b
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rd for him. I will gladly await his arrival
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94\
\'93You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow.\'94 \
\'93Singer,\'94 Tyrion said, turning to Marillion, \'93when you make a b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 llad of this, be certain you tell them how L
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 dy Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 knight.\'94 \
\'93I deny you nothing!\'94 Lysa Arryn said, her voice peeved and shrill with irritation. \'93Name your champion
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Imp . . . if y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u think you can find a man to die for you.\'94 \
\'93If it is all the same to you, I\'92d sooner find one to kill for me.\'94 Tyrion looked over the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 long hall. No one moved. For a long moment he wondered if it had all been a colossal blunder. \
Then ther
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  was a stirring in the rear of the chamber. \'93I\'92ll stand for the dwarf,\'94 Bronn called out. \

EDDARD \
He dreamt an old dream, of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and Lyan
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 a in her bed of blood. \
In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud Martyn Cassel, Jory\'92s father; faithful Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been Brandon\'92s squire; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle of heart; the crann
\f3 ogman
\f1 , Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man\'92s memorie
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, g
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ey wraiths on horses made of mist. \
They were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hite cloaks blowing in the wind. And these w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpen
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng his blade with a whetstone. Across his white- enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ts wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \
\'93I looked for you on the Trident,\'94 Ned said to them. \
\'93We were not there,\'94 Ser Gerold 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nswered. \
\'93Woe to the Usurpe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  if we had been,\'94 said Ser Oswell. \
\'93When King\'92s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.\'94 \
\'93Far away,\'94 Ser Gerold said, \'93or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.\'94 \
\'93I came down on Storm\'92s End to lift the siege,\'94 Ned told them, \'93and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.\'94 \
\'93Our knees do not bend easily,\'94 said Ser Arthur Dayne. \
\'93Ser Willem Darr
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.\'94 \
\'93Ser Willem is a good man and true,\'94 said 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Oswell. \
\'93But not of the Kingsguard,\'94 Ser Gerold pointed out. \'93The Kingsguard does not flee.\'94 \
\'93Then or now,\'94 said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm. \
\'93We swore a vow,\'94 explained old Ser Gerold. \
Ned\'92s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ords in hand. They were seven against three. \
\'93And now it begins,\'94 said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light. \
\'93No,\'94 Ned said with sadness in his voice. \'93Now it ends.\'94 As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow, he could
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hear Lyanna screaming. \'93Eddard!\'94 she called. A storm of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death. \
\'93Lo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d Eddard,\'94 Lyanna called again. \
\'93I promise,\'94 he whispered. \'93Lya, I promise .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . \'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard,\'94 a man echoed from the dark. \
Groaning, Eddard Stark opened his eyes. Moonlight streamed th
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ough the tall windows of the Tower of the Hand. \
\'93Lord Eddard?\'94 A shadow stood over the bed.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93How . . . how long?\'94 The sheets were tangled, his leg splinted and plastered. A dull throb of pain sho
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  up his side. \
\'93Six days and seven nights.\'94 The voice was Vayon Poole\'92s. The steward held a cup 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o Ned\'92s lips. \'93Drink, my lord.\'94 \
\'93What . . . ?\'94 \
\'93Only water. Maester Pycelle said you w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld be thirsty.\'94\
Ned drank. His l
\f3 ips 
\f1 were parched and cracked. The wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er tasted sweet as honey. \
\'93The king left orders,\'94 Vayon Poole told him when the cup was empty.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93He would speak with you, my lord.\'94 \
\'93On the morrow,\'94 Ned said. \'93When I am stronger.\'94 He could not face Robert now. The dream had left him weak as 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  kitt
\f3 en. 
\f1 \
\'93My lord,\'94 Poole said, \'93he commande
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  
\f3 us to se
\f1 nd you to him the moment you opened your eyes.\'94 The steward busied himself lighting a bedside candle. \
Ned cursed softly. Robert was never known for his patience. \'93Tell him I\'92m too weak to come to him. If he wishes to speak wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h me, I should be pleased to receive him here. I hope you wake him from a sound sleep. And 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ummon . . . \'94 He was about to say Jory when he remembered. \'93Summon the captain of my guard.\'94 \
Alyn stepped i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 to the bedchamber a few moments after the stew
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd had taken his
\f3  lea
\f1 ve. \'93My lord.\'94 \
\'93Poole tells me it has been six days,\'94 Ned said. \'93I must know how things stand.\'94 \
\'93The Kingslayer is fled the 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ity,\'94 Alyn told him. \'93The talk is he\'92s ridden back to Casterly Rock to join his fa
\f3 ther. Th
\f1 e story of how Lady Cately
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  took the Imp is on every lip. I have put on extra guards, if it please you.\'94 \
\'93It does,\'94 Ned assured him. \'93My daughters?\'94 \
\'93They have been with you every day, my lord. Sansa prays quietly, but Arya . . . \'94 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e hesitated. \'93She has not said a word since they brought you back. She is a fierce little thing, my 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ord. I have never seen such anger in a girl.\'94 \
\'93Whatever happens,\'94 Ned said, \'93I want my daughters kept safe. I fear this is only the beginning.\'94 \
\'93No harm will come to them,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 L
\f3 ord E
\f1 ddard,\'94 Alyn said. \'93I stake my life on that.\'94\
\'93Jory and the others . . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'94\
\'93I gave them over to the silent sisters, to be sent north to Winterfell. Jory would want to \
lie beside his grandfather.\'94 \
It would have to be his grandfather, for Jory\'92s father was buried far to the south. Marty
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Cassel had perished with the rest. Ned had pulled the tower down afterward, and used its bloody stones to build eig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t cairns upon the ridge. It was said that Rhaegar had named that place 
\f3 the t
\f1 ower of joy, but for Ned it was a bitter memory. They had been seven against three, yet only two had lived to ride away; Eddard Stark himself and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he little crannogman, Howland Reed. He did not think it omened well that he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 should dream that dream again after so many years. \
\'93You\'92ve done well, Alyn,\'94 Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned. The steward bowed low. \'93His Grace is witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t, my lord, and the queen with him.\'94 \
Ned pushed himself up higher, wincing as his leg trembled with pain. He had not expected Cersei to come. It did not bode well that sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had. \'93Send them in, and leave us. What we have to say should not go beyond these walls.\'94 Poole wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 drew quietly. \
Robert had taken time to dress. He wore a black velvet doublet with the crowned stag o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  Baratheon worked upon the breast in golden thre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d, and a golden ma
\f3 ntle
\f1  with a cloak of black and gold squares. A flagon of wine was in his hand, his face already flushed from drink. Cersei Lannister entered behind him, a jeweled tiara in her hair. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Ned said. \'93Your pardons. I cannot rise.\'94 \
\'93No matter,\'94 the king said gruffly. \'93Some wine? From th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Arbor. A good vintage.\'94 \
\'93A small cup,\'94 Ned said. \'93My head is still heavy from the milk of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 poppy.\'94 \
\'93A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders,\'94 the queen declared. \
\'93Quiet, woman,\'94 Robert sna
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ped. He brought Ned a cup of wine. \'93Does the leg still pain you?\'94 \
\'93Some,\'94 Ned said. His head was swimming, but it would not do to admit to weakness in front of the queen. \
\'93Pycelle swears it will heal clean.\'94 Robert frowned. \'93I take it you know what Catelyn has done?\'94 \
\'93I do.\'94 Ned took a small swallow of wine. \'93My lady wife is blameless, Yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 r Grace. All she \
did 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he did at my command.\'94\
\'93I am not pleased, Ned,\'94 Robert grumbled. \
\'93By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood?\'94 Cersei demanded. \'93Who do you think you are?\'94 \
\'93The Hand of the King,\'94 Ned told her with icy courtesy. \'93Charged by your own lord husband to keep the king\'92s pea
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e and enforce the king\'92s justice.\'94 \
\'93You were the Hand,\'94 Cersei began, \'93but now\'97\'94 \
\'93Silence!\'94 the king roared. \'93You asked him a question and he answered it.\'94 Cersei subsided, cold with anger, and Robert turned back to Ned. \'93Keep the king\'92s peace, you say. Is this how you keep my peace, Ned? Seven men are dead . . . 
\f3 \'94 \
\'93E
\f1 ight,\'94 the queen corrected. \'93Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave him.\'94 \
\'93Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,\'94 the king said. \'93I will not have it, Ned.\'94 \
\'93Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp\'97\'94 
\f3 \
\'93
\f1 I said, I will not have it! To hell with her reasons. You will command her to release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.\'94 \
\'93Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime 
\f3 Lan
\f1 nister wished to chasten me. 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 m I to forget that?\'94 \
\'93My brother was not the cause
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of this quarrel,\'94 Cersei told the king. \'93Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel. His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.\'94 \
\'93Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u know me better than that, Robert,\'94 Ned said. \'93Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me. He was there.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ve talked 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o Littlefinger,\'94 Robert said. \'93He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began, but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse.\'94 \
\'93Some whorehouse? Damn your eyes, Robert, I went there to have a look at your \
daughter! Her mother has named her Barra. She loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 s like that first girl you fathered, when we were boys together in the Vale.\'94 He watched the queen as he spoke; her face was a mask, still and pale, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 etraying nothing. \
Robert flushed. \'93Barra,\'94 he grumbled. \'93Is that supposed to please me? Damn the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 irl. I thought she had more sense.\'94 \
\'93She cannot be more than fifteen, and a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 whore, and you thought she had sense?\'94 Ned said, incredulous. His leg was beginning to pain him sorely. It was hard to keep his temper. \'93The fool child is in love with you, Robe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 t.\'94 \
The king glanced at Cersei. \'93This is
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 no fit su\cf2 bj\cf3 ect for the queen\'92\cf2 s \cf3 ears.
\f2 \cf2 \'94
\f1 \cf3  \
\'93Her G\cf2 ra\cf3 ce will have no li\cf2 ki\cf3 ng fo
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38  anythin
\f2\b0\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  I have to say,\'94 Ned replied. \'93I am told the Kingslayer has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.\'94 \
The king swirled the wine in his cup, brooding. He took a swallow. \'93No,\'94 he said. \'93I want no more of this. Jaime slew three of your men, and you five of his. Now it ends.\'94 \
\'93Is that your notion of justice?\'94 Ned flared. \'93If so, I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand.\'94 \
The queen looked to her husband. \'93If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to you\'97\'94 \
\'93Do you take me for Aery
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 Robert interrupted. \
\'93I took you for a king. Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers, by all the laws of marriage and the bonds we share. The Starks have driven off the one and seized the other. This man dishonors you with every breath he takes, and yet you stand there meekly, asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine.\'94 \
Robert\'92s face was dark with anger. \'93How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue, woman?\'94 \
Cersei\'92s face was a study in contempt. \'93What a jape the gods have made of us 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 wo,\'94 she said. \'93By all rights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail.\'94 \
Purple with rage, the king lashed out, a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head. She stumbled against the table and fell hard, yet Cersei Lannister did not cry out. Her slender fingers brushed her cheek, where the pale smooth skin was already reddening. On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face. \'93I shall wear this as a badge of \
honor,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she announced. \
\'93Wear it in silence, or I\'92ll honor you again,\'94 Robert vowed. He shouted for a guard. Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room, tall and somber in his white armor. \'93The queen is tired. See her to her bedchamber.\'94 The knight helped Cersei to her feet and led her out w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 thout a word. \
Robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup. \'93You see what she does to me, Ned.\'94 The king seated himself, cradling his wine cup. \'93My loving wife. The mother of my children.\'94 The rage was gone from hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  now; in his eyes Ned saw something sad and scared. \'93I should not have hit her. That was not . . . that was not kingly.\'94 He stared down at his hands, as if he did not quite 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 now what they were. \'93I was always strong . . . no one could stand before me, no 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne. How do you fight someone if you can\'92t 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 it them?\'94 Confused, the king shook his head. \'93Rhaegar . . . Rhaegar won, damn him. I killed him,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Ned, I drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart, and he died at my feet. They made up songs about it. Yet somehow he still won. He has Lyanna now, and I have her.\'94 The king drained his cup. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Ned Stark said, \'93we must talk . . . \'94 \
Robert pressed his fingertips against his temples. \'93I am sick unto death of talk. On the morrow I\'92m going to the kingswood to hunt.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Whatever you have to say can wait until I return.\'94 \
\'93If the gods are good, I shall not be here on your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 return. You commanded me to return to Winterfell, remember?\'94 \
Robert stood up, grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself. \'93The gods are seldom good, Ned. Here, this is yours.\'94 He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed. \'93Like it or not, you are my Hand, damn you. I forbid you to leave.\'94 \
Ned picked up the silver clasp. He was being given no choice, it seemed. His leg throbb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, and he felt as helpless as a child. \'93The Targaryen girl\'97\'94 \
The king groaned. \'93Seven hells, don\'92t start with her again. That\'92s done, I\'92ll hear no more of it.\'94 \
\'93Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?\'94 \
\'93Why?\'94 Robert laughed. \'93Why not? Someo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e has to rule 
\f3 thi
\f1 s damnable kingdom. Put on the badge, Ned. It suits you. And if you ever throw it in my face again, I swear to you, I\'92ll \
pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.\'94 \

CATELYN \
The eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn Stark watched the light spread, her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window. Below 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d forests. Pale white mists rose off Alyssa\'92s Tears, where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long tumble down the face of the Giant\'92s Lance. Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face. \
Alyssa Arryn had seen her hus
\f3 band, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in l
\f1 ife she had 
\f3 never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decre
\f1 ed that she would know no rest until her weepin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  watered the black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn wondered how large a wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 erfall her own tears would make when she died. \'93Tell me the rest of it,\'94 she said. \
\'93The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,\'94 Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind her. \'93Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Roc
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 , demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no answer. Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass below the Golden Tooth. He vows to you that he will yield no foot o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood.\'94 \
Catelyn turned away from the sunrise. Its beauty did lit
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 le to lighten her mood; it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to. \'93Edmure has sent riders and made vows,\'94 she said, \'93but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun. What of my lord father?\'94 \
\'93The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady.\'94 Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds; he looked almost himself again. \
\'93My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick,\'94 she said, worried. \'93
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived.\'94 \
\'93Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me.\'94 \
\'93I should have been woken,\'94 she insisted. \
\'93The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat,\'94 Ser Rodrik said. \
\'93Then she still plans to go through with this mummer\'92s farce?\'94 Catelyn grimaced. \'93The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he is too deaf to hear the tune. Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took our leave. My place is at Winterfell with my sons. If you are strong enough to travel, I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown. We can take ship from there.\'94 \
\'93Another ship?\'94 Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to shudder. \'93As you say, my lady.\'94 \
The ol
\f3 d knight waited o
\f1 utside her door as Catelyn summoned the ser
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ants Lysa had given her. If she spoke to her sister before the duel, perhaps she could change her mind, she thought as they dressed her. Lysa\'92s policies varied with her moods, and her moods changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, timid, stubborn, vain, and, above all, inconstant. \
When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess, Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brought to them privately, but no, nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the Vale. And now this . . . \
\'93
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 annister is my prisoner,\'94 she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the Eyrie\'92s cold white halls. Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt. \'93My sister must be reminded of that.\'94 \
At the doors to Lysa\'92s apartment
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , they met her uncle storming out. \'93Going to join the fool\'92s festival?\'94 Ser Brynden snapped. \'93I\'92d tell you t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but you\'92d only bruise your hand.\'94 \
\'93There was a bird from Riverrun,\'94 Catelyn began, \'93a letter from Edmure . . . \'94 \
\'93I know, child.\'94 The black fish that fastened 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is cloak was Brynden\'92s only concession to ornament. \'93I had to hear it from Maester Colemon. I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with al
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  haste. Do you know what she told me? The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even one, Uncle, she said. You are the Knight of the Gate. Your place is here.\'94 A gust of childish laughter drifted through \
the open doors behind him, and her uncle gl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nced darkly over his shoulder. \'93Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate. Black fish or no, I am still a Tully. I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.\'94 \
Catelyn could not pretend to surprise. \'93Alone? You know as well as I that you will never survive the high road. Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell. Come with us, Uncle. I w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ll give you your thousand men. Riverrun will not fight alone.\'94 \
Brynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement. \'93As you say. It\'92s the long way home, but I\'92m more like to get there. I\'92ll wait 
\f3 for yo
\f1 u below.\'94 He went striding off, his c
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 oak swirling behind him. \
Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik. They went through the doors to the high, nervous sou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d of a child\'92s giggles. \
Lysa\'92s apartments opened over a small garden, a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers. The builders had intended it as a godswood, but t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain, and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Val
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , they could not get a weirwood to take root here. So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and sca
\f3 tte
\f1 red statuar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  amidst low, f
\f3 low
\f1 ering shrubs. It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives, and that of Tyrion Lannister, into the hands of the gods. \
Lysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her milk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat, surroun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ed by her knights, retainers, and lords high and low. Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the Vale of Arryn by her side. From what Catelyn 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad seen during her stay at the Eyrie, it was a vain hope. \
A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert\'92s chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie sat, giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other. Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were sipping a sweet orange- scented wine from engraved silver cups. A fool\'92s festival, Brynden had called i
\f3 t, and 
\f1 small wonder
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
Across the terrace, Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter\'92s, and nibbled a blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray\'92s dagger. They were the suitors who stood highest in Lysa\'92s favor . . . today, at least. Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable. Eon Hunter was even older than 
\f3 Jon 
\f1 Arryn had been, half-
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 rippled by gout, and cursed with three quarrelsome sons, each more grasping than the last. Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly; lean and handsome, heir to an ancient but \
impoverished house, but vain, reckless, hot-tempered . . . and, it was whispered, notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women. \
When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cheek. \'93Isn\'92t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us. Do try a cup of the wine, sweet sister. Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.\'94 \
\'93Thank you, no. Lysa, we must talk.\'94\
\'93After,\'94 her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her. \
\'93Now.\'94 Catelyn spoke more loudly than she\'92d intended. Men were turning to look. \'93Lysa, you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly. Alive, the Imp has 
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 alue. Dead, he is only food for crows. And if his champion should prevail here\'97\'94 \
\'93Small chance of that, my lady,\'94 Lord Hunter assured her, patting her shoulder with a l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ver-spotted hand. \'93Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter. He will make short work of the sellsword.\'94 \
\'93Will he, my lord?\'94 Catelyn said coolly. \'93I wonder.\'94 She had seen Bronn fi
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht on the 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 igh road; it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died. He moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm. \
Lysa\'92s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom. \'93Women understand little of these things,\'94 Ser Morton Waynwood said. \'93Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady. This other
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fel
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them.\'94 
\f3 \
\'93Say
\f1  you have th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  truth of it, then,\'94 Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache. \'93What will we gain by the dwarf\'92s death? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we g
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain?\'94 \
\'93Behead the man,\'94 Ser Lyn Corbray suggested. \'93When the Kingslayer receives the Imp\'92s head, it will be a warning to him,\'94 \
Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair. \'93Lord Robert wants to see him fly,\'94 she said, as if that settled the matter. \'93And the Imp has only himself to blame. It was he who demanded a trial by combat.\'94 \
\'93Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she\'92d wished to,\'94 Lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Hunter intoned ponderously. \
Ignoring them all, Catelyn turned all her force on her sister. \'93I remind you, Tyrion Lannister is my prisoner.\'94 \
\'93And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!\'94 Her voice rose. \'93He poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay!\'94 Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace. Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Do you think he did?\'94 Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again. \'93Murder Lord Jon, that is? The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely . . . \'94 \
\'93I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,\'94 Catelyn replied, \'93but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say.\'94 Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer . . . perhaps because the dwarf was here, while the queen was safe behind the 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 alls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the south. Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister\'92s letter before reading it. \
Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. \'93Poison, well . . . that could be the dwarf\'92s work, true enough. Or Cersei\'92s. I
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s said po
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 son is a woman\'92s weapon, begging your pardons, my lady. The Kingslayer, now . . . I have no great liking for the man, but he\'92s not the sort. Too fond of the sigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  of blood on that golden sword of his. Was it poison, my lady?\'94 \
Catelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy. \'93How else could they make it look a natural death?\'94 Behind her, Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half, spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace. She glanced at her nephew and sighed. \'93The boy is utterly without discipline. He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.\'94 \
\'93His lord father agreed with you,\'94 said a voice at her elbow. She turned to b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 hold Maester Colemon, a cup of wine in his hand. \'93He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you know . . . oh, but I\'92m speaking out of turn.\'94 The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester\'92s chain. \'93I fear I\'92ve had too much of Lord Hunter\'92s excellent wine. The prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all a-fray . . . \'94 \
\'93You are mistaken, Maester,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93It was Casterly Rock, not Dragonstone, and those arrangements were made after the Hand\'92s death, without my sister\'92s consent.\'94 \
The maester\'92s head jerked so vigo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself. \'93No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it was Lord \
Jon who\'97\'94 \
A bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike brok
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  off what they were doing and moved to the 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 alustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie\'92s plump sept
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa. \
\'93The ba
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  little man,\'94 Lord Robert said, giggling. \'93Mother, can I mak
\f3 e him 
\f1 fly? I want to see him fly.\'94 \
\'93Later, my sweet baby,\'94 Lysa promised h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m.\
\'93Trial first,\'94 drawled Ser Lyn Corbray, \'93then execution.\'94 \
A moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden. The knight was attended by two young squires, the sellsword by the Eyrie\'92s master-at-arms. \
Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and- falcon sigil of House Arryn, prote
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ted the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his throat. Falcon\'92s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision. \
Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lm with a noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a longer reach . . . and Bronn wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  fifteen years younger, if she was any judge. \
They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with Lannister between them. The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his waist. He lifted it high above his head, and the light shattered. Rainbows danced across the Imp\'92s face. In a high, solemn,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 singsong voice, the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness, to find the truth in this man\'92s soul, to grant him life and freedom if he was innocent, death if he was guilty. His voice echoed off the surrounding towers. \
When the last echo had died away, the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty departure. Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn\'92s ear before the guardsmen led him away. The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from \
his knee. \
Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair. \'93When are they going to fight?\'94 he asked plaintively. \

\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires. The other brought him a triangular shield almost four feet tall, heavy oak dotted with iron studs. They strapped it to his left forearm. When Lysa\'92s master-at-arms offered Bronn a similar shield, the sellsword spat and waved it away. Three days growth of coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks, but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor; the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours, until it was too sharp to touch. \
Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ts pommel was a falcon\'92s head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. \'93I had that sword crafted for 
\f2\fs24 J
\f1\fs28 on in King\'92s Landing,\'94 Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. \'93He wore it whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert\'92s place. Isn\'92t it a l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 vely thing? I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.\'94 \
The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with her sister. \
\'93Make them fight!\'94 Lord Robert called out. \
Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sword in salute. \'93For the Eyrie and the Vale!\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden, flanked by his guards. It was to him that Bronn turned with a cursory salute. \
\'93They await your command,\'94 Lady Lysa said to her lord son.\
\'93Fight!\'94 the boy screamed, his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair. \
Ser Vardis swiveled, bringing up his heavy shield. Bronn turned to face him. Their swords rang together, o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ce, twice, a testing. The sellsword backed off a step. The knight came after, holding his shield before him. He tried a slash, but Bronn jerked back, just out of reach, and the silver blade cut only air. Bronn circled to his right
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Ser Vardis turned to follow, keeping his shield between them. The knight pressed forwa
\f3 rd, p
\f1 lac
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng \
each foot carefully on the uneven ground. The sellsword gave way, a faint smile
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 playing over his lips. Ser Vardis attacked, slashing, but Bronn leapt away from him, hopping lightly over a low, moss-covered stone. Now the sellsword circled left, away from the shield, toward the knight\'92s unprotected sid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 . Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs, but he did not have the reach. Bronn danced farther to his left. Ser Vardis turned in place. \
\'93The man is craven,\'94 Lord Hunter declared. \'93Stand and fight, coward! \'93 Other voices echoed the sentiment. \
Catelyn looked to Ser Rodrik. Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head. \'93He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him. The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man.\'94 \
She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life, had viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time, but this was something different and deadlie
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 : a dance where the smallest misstep meant death. And as she watched, the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark, as vivid as if it had been yesterday. \
They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. \'93He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die.\'94 And her betrothed looked at her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the boy who loved her. \
That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. \'93Yield!\'94 he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr\'92s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as he fell and murmured \'93Cat\'94 as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that. \
That was the last time she had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 seen his face . . . until the day she was brought before him in King\'92s Landing. \
A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, but her lord father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ed. Lysa helped their maester \
nurse him; she had been softer and shyer in those days. Edmure had called on him as well, but Petyr had sent him away. Her brother had acted as Brandon\'92s squire at the duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As soon as he was strong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a 
\f3 closed
\f1  litter, to finish his healing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he\'92d been born. \
The ringing clash of steel on steel jarred Catelyn back to the present. Ser Vardis was coming hard at Bronn, driving into him with shield and sword. The sellsword scrambled backward, checking each blow, stepping lithely over rock and root, his eyes never leaving his foe. He was quicker, 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 atelyn saw; the knight\'92s silvered sword never came near to touching him, but his own ugly grey blade hacked a notch from Ser Vardis\'92s shoulder plate. \
The brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when Bronn sidestepped and slid behind the statue of the weeping woman. Ser Vardis lunged at where he had been, striking 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  spark off the pale marble of Alyssa\'92s thigh. \
\'93They\'92re not fighting good, Mother,\'94 the Lord of the Eyrie complained. \'93I want them to fight.\'94 \
\'93They will, sweet baby,\'94 his mother soothed him. \'93The sellsword can\'92t run all day.\'94 \
Some of the lords on Lysa\'92s terrace were making wry jests as they refilled their wine cups, but across the garden, Tyrion Lannister\'92s mismatched eyes watched the champions dance as if there were nothing else i

\f1\fs28  the world. \
Bronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast, still moving left, aiming a two- handed cut at the knight\'92s unshielded right side. Ser Vardis blocked, but clumsily, and the sellsword\'92s blade flashed upward at 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is head. Metal rang, and a falcon\'92s wing collapsed 
\f2\fs24 w
\f3\fs28 it
\f1 h a crunch. Ser Vardis took a 
\f3 half step back to brace
\f1  h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 mself, raised his shield. Oak chips flew as Bronn\'92s sword hacked at the wooden wa
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l. The sellsword stepped left again, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 way from the shield, and caught Ser Vardis across the stom
\f3 ach, 
\f1 the razor edge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into the knight\'92s plate. \
Ser Var
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 is drove forward off his back foot, his own silver blade descending in a savage arc. Bronn slamm
\f3 ed it aside
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 and d
\f1 anced away. The knight crashed into the weeping woman, rocking her on her plinth. Stagger
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, he stepped ba
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 kward, his head turning this way and that as he searched for his foe. The slit visor of his helm narrowed his vision. \
\'93Behind you, ser!\'94 Lord Hunter shouted, too late. Bronn brought his sword down with 
\f3 both hand
\f1 s, catching Ser Vardis in the elbow of his sword arm. The thin lobstered metal \
that protected the joint crunched. The knight grunted, turning, wrenching his weapon up. This time Bronn stood his ground. The swords flew at each other, and their steel 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ong filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the Eyrie. \
\'93Ser Vardis is hurt,\'94 Ser Rodrik said, his voice grave. \
Catelyn did not need to be told; she had eyes, she could see the bright finger of blood running along the knight\'92s forearm, the wetness inside the elbow joint. Every parry was a
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 little sl\cf2 ow\cf3 er and a little lo\cf2 we\cf3 r tha
\f2 \cf2 n
\f1 \cf3  the one \cf2 be\cf3 fore. Ser Vardis t\cf2 ur\cf3 ned h
\f2 \cf2 i
\f0\b\fs38 s si
\f2\b0\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e to his foe, trying to use his shield to block instead, but Bronn slid around him, quick as a cat. The sellsword seemed to be getting stronger. His cuts were leaving their marks now. Deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight\'92s armor, on his right thigh, his beaked visor, crossing on his breastplate, a long one along the front of his gorget. The moon-and- falcon rondel over Ser Vardis\'92s right arm was sheared clean in half, hanging by its strap. They could hear his labored breath, rattling through the air holes in his visor. \
Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was hap
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ening below th
\f3 em, ye
\f1 t her sister could not. \'93Enough, Ser Vardis!\'94 Lady Lysa called down. \'93Finish him now, my baby is growing tired.\'94 \
And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady\'92s command, even to the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance. Ser 
\f2\fs24 V
\f1\fs28 ardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the sellsword\'92s face. Almost, almost, Bronn lost his feet . . . he staggered back, tripped over a rock, and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance. Throwing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from neck to navel . . . if the sellsword had stood to receive it. \
But Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn\'92s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e way up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the statu
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 \'92s back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went down beneath her. \
Bronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 t 
\f1 was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he ribs. Ser Vardis Egen shuddered and lay still. \
Silence hung over the Eyrie. Bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to the grass. H
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught him, and his coal-black hair was soaked with sweat.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He spit out a broken tooth. \
\'93Is it over, Mother?\'94 the Lord of the Eyrie asked. \
No, Catelyn wanted to tell him, it\'92s only now beginning. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Lysa said glumly, her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard. \
\'93Can I make the little man fly now?\'94 \
Across the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to his feet. \'93Not this little man,\'94 he said. \'93This little man is going down in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.\'94 \
\'93You presume\'97\'94 Lysa began.\
\'93I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words,\'94 the Imp said. \'93As High as \
Honor.\'94\
\'93You promised I could make him fly,\'94 the Lord of t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Eyrie screamed at his mother. He \
began to shake. \
Lady Lysa\'92s face was flushed with 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ury. \'93The gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent, child. We have no cho
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ce but to free him.\'94 She lifted her voice. \'93Guards. Take my lord of Lannister and his . . . creature here out of my sight. Escort them to the Bloody Gate and set them free. See that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the Tri
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ent, and make certain all their good
\f3 s an
\f1 d weapons a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e returned to them. They shall need them on the high road.\'94 \
\'93The high road,\'94 Tyrion Lannister said. Lysa allowed herself a faint, satisfied smile. It was another sort of death sentence, Catelyn realized. Tyrion Lannister must know that as well. Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow. \'93As you command, my lady,\'94 he said. \'93I believe we know the way.\'94 \

JON \
You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained,\'94 Ser All
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard. \'93Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will.\'94 He called out the names one by one. \'93Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon.\'94 Last, he looked at Jon. \'93And the Bastard.\'94 \
Pyp let fly a whoop and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 thrust his sword int
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  the air. Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare. \'93They will call you men of Night\'92s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer\'92s Monkey here if you believe that. You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them. \
The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted, \'93
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 oad, of the Night\'92s Watch!\'94 Yelling that a bl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn\'92s shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and re
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 urned with a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the yard. Jon offered him the skin. \'93A swallow of wine?\'94 \
Sam shook his head. \'93No thank you, Jon.\'94 \'93Are you well?\'94 \
\'93Very well, truly,\'94 the fat boy lied. \'93I am so happy for you all.\'94 His round face quivered as he forced a smile. \'93You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.\'94 \
\'93Is,\'94 Jon corrected. He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead. Before he could say more, Haider cried, \'93Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?\'94 Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in \
protest at the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs. \
By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone. \
That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion. When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire. The older men 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 lapped him on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed y
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 llow turnips swimming in butter. \'93From the Lord Commander\'92s own table,\'94 Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream. \
\'93Do you think they\'92ll keep us together?\'94 Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily. \
Toad made a face. \'93I hope not. I\'92m sick of looking at those ears of yours.\'94 \
\'93Ho,\'94 said Pyp. \'93Listen to the crow call the raven black. You\'92re certain to be a ranger, Toad. They\'92ll want you as far 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rom the castle as they can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he\'92ll run off screaming.\'94 \
Everyone laughed but Grenn. \'93I hope I\'92m a ranger.\'94 \
\'93You and everyone else,\'94 said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night\'92s Watch. It was they who dared ride beyond the 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 all, 
\f3 sweep
\f1 ing through the haunted forest and the 
\f3 icy mountain heights west of the Shadow 
\f1 Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears. \
\'93Not everyone,\'94 said Halder. \'93It\'92s the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?\'94 \
The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps 
\f3 and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest p
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 essed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 se days were centuries gone, however; now, it was 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what \
repairs they could. \
\'93The Old Bear\'92s no fool,\'94 Dareon observed. \'93You\'92re certain to be a builder, and Jon\'92s certain to be a ranger. He\'92s the best sword and the best rider among us, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his uncle was the First before he . . . \'94 His voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said. \
\'93Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,\'94 Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle\'92s safe return, but not him. He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench. \
\'93Aren\'92t you going to eat those?\'94 Toad asked. \
\'93They\'92re yours.\'94 Jon had hardly tasted Hobb\'92s great feast. \'93I could not eat another bite.\'94 He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his way out. \
Pyp followed him. \'93Jon, what is it?\'94\
\'93Sam,\'94 he admitted. \'93He was not at t
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ble tonight.\'94\
\'93It\'92s not like him to miss a meal,\'94 Pyp said thoughtfully. \'93Do you suppose he\'92s taken ill?\'94 \
\'93He\'92s fr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ghtened. We\'92re leaving him.\'94 He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he\'92d given h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Needle. \'93Once we say our words, we\'92ll all have duties to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ly know what they\'92ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first chance he gets.\'94 \
Pyp made a grimace. \'93You did all you could.\'94 \'93All we could wasn\'92t enough,\'94 J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n said. \
A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin\'92s Tower for Ghost. The direwolf walked beside him to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Jon let him go. A wolf needed to hunt. \
He had no dest
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nation in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. \
It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was dow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King\'92s Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Caste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon would never see. The world was down that road . . . and he was here. \
Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his h
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 me until he was old as Maester Aemon. \'93I have not sworn yet,\'94 he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the penalty for his crimes. He had come here freely, and he might leave freely . . . until he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said the words. He need only ride on, and he could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his brothers. \
Your half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There 
\f3 was no pl
\f1 ace for him in Winterfell, no place in King\'92s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had been, what she had looked like, why his father had left her. Because she was a w
\f3 hor
\f1 e or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or el
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her? \
Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  behind him. The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon. \
He wheeled his horse around and started for home
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \
Ghost
\f3  retur
\f1 ned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander\'92s Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  he trotted beside the horse. Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time he 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eached the stables, he knew what he must do. \
Maester Aemon\'92s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the Night\'92s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at them. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon\'92s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry. \
It was Chett who answered Jon\'92s knock. \'93I need to speak to Maester Aemon,\'94 Jon told him. \
\'93The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe he\'92ll see you.\'94 He began to shut the door. \
Jon jammed it open with his boot. \'93I need 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o speak to him now. The morning 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ill be too late.\'94 \
Chett scowled. \'93The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you know how old he is?\'94 \
\'93Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,\'94 Jon said. \'93Give him my pardons. I would not disturb his rest if it were not important.\'94 \
\'93And if I refuse?\'94\
J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n had his boot wedged solidl
\f3 y in
\f1  the door. \'93I can stand here all night if I must.\'94 \
The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. \'93Wait in the library. There\'92s wood. Start a fire. I won\'92t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.\'94 \
Jon had the logs crackling merri
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s throat was the chain collar of his order. A maester did not remove it even to sleep. \'93The chair beside 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he fir
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  would be pleasant,\'94 he said when he felt the warmth on his face. When he was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door. \
\'93I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,\'94 Jon Snow said. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93You did not wake me,\'94 Maester Aemon replied. \'93I find I need less sleep as I grow o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 der, and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?\'94 \
\'93To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night\'92s Watch.\'94 \
\'93This is no concern of Maester Aemon,\'94 Chett complained. \
\'93Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nds of Ser Alliser Thorne,\'94 the maester said gently. \'93Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know. Why then come to me?\'94 \
\'93The Lord Commander listens to you,\'94 Jon told him. \'93And
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the wounded and the sick of the Night\'92s Watch are in your charge.\'94 \
\'93And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \'93He will be,\'94 Jon promised, \'93unless you help.\'94 \
He told them all of it,
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 even the \cf2 pa\cf3 rt where he\'92d set \cf2 Gh\cf3 ost a
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3  Rast\'92s t\cf2 hr\cf3 oat. Maester Aemon\cf2  l\cf3 isten
\f2 \cf2 e
\f0\b\fs38 d silen
\f2\b0\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ly, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett\'92s face darkened with each word. \'93Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance,\'94 Jon finished. \'93He\'92s hopeless with a sword. My sister Arya could tear him apart, and she\'92s not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it\'92s only a matter of time before he\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hur
\f3 t or
\f1  killed.\'94 \
Chett could stand no more. \'93I\'92ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,\'94 he said. \'93He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.\'94 \
\'93Maybe it is so,\'94 Maester Aemon said. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?\'94 \
\'93Leave him where he is,\'94 Chett said. \'93The Wall is no place for the weak. Let him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s stupid,\'94 Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thou
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hts. \'93I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.\'94 \
Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links. \'93Go on.\'94 \
\'93He told me that a maester\'92s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,\'94 Jon said, remembering. \'93I asked why each link
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ges his chain with stu
\f3 dy
\f1 , he told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn\'92t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can\'92t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.\'94 \
Maester Aemon smiled. \'93And so?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93The Night\'92s Watch needs all sorts too. Why els
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn\'92t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won\'92t either. You can\'92t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that doesn\'92t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn\'92t Sam be a steward?\'94 \
Chett gave an angry scowl. \'93I\'92m a steward. You think it\'92s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 atch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.\'94 \
Maester Aemon was gentler. \'93Is your friend a hunter?\'94 \'93H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  hates hunting,\'94 Jon had to admit. \
\'93Can he plow a field?\'94 the maester asked. \'93Can 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow?\'94 \
\'93No.\'94 \
Chett gave a nasty laugh. \'93I\'92ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they\'92re put to work. Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.\'94 \
\'93I know one thing Sam could do bet
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er than anyone.\'94 \'93Yes?\'94 Maester Aemon prompted. \
Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. \'93He could help you,\'94 he said quickly. \'93He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write. I know Chett can\'92t 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ead, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in his father\'92s library. He\'92d be good with the ravens
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 too. Animals seem to like him. Ghost took to him straight off. There\'92s a lot he could do, besides fighti
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g. The Night\'92s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.\'94 \
Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep. Finally he said, \'93Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.\'94 \
\'93Does that mean . . . \'94\
\'93It means I shall think on what you have said,\'94 the maester told him firmly. \'93And now, I \
believe I am ready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door.\'94 \

TYRION \
They had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road. Tyrion was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gathering deadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream. He stooped to pick up a splinte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed branch and examined it critically. \'93Will this do? I am not practiced at starting
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fires. Morrec did that for me.\'94 \
\'93A fire?\'94 Bronn said, spitting. \'93Are you so hungry to die, dwarf? Or have you taken leave of your senses? A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around. I mean to survive this journey, Lannister.\'94 \
\'93And how do you hope to do that?\'94 Tyrion asked. He tucked the branch under his arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His back ached from the effort of bending; they had been riding since daybreak, w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en a stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the Bloody Gate and commanded them never to return. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 We have no chance of fighting our way back,\'94 Bronn said, \'93but two can cover more ground than ten, and attr
\f3 act 
\f1 less notice. The fewer days we spend in these mountains, the more like we are to reach the riverlands. Ride hard and fast, I say. Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no noise and light no fires.\'94 \
Tyrion Lannister sighed. \'93A splendid plan, Bronn. Try it, as you like . . . and forgive me if I do not linger to bury you.\'94 \
\'93You think to outlive me, dwarf?\'94 The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen\'92s shield had crac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed a tooth in half. \
Tyrion shrugged. \'93Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull. I prefer to make my crossing s
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ow and easy. I know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under us this time, we\'92ll be trying to saddle shadowcats . . . and if truth be told, I think the clans will find us no matter what we do. Their eyes 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 re all around us.\'94 He swept a gloved hand over the high, wind-carved crags that s
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rrounded them. \
Bronn grimaced. \'93Then we\'92re dead men, Lannister.\'94 \
\'93If so, I prefer to die comfortable,\'94 T
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rion replied. \'93We need a fire. The nights are cold up here, and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits. Do you suppose there\'92s any game to be had? Lady Lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast 
\f3 of salt
\f1  beef, hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester.\'94 \
\'93I can find meat.\'94 Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn\'92s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously. \'93I should leave you here with your fool\'92s fire. If I took your horse, I\'92d have twice the chance to
\f3  make
\f1  it through. What would you do then, dwarf?\'94 \
\'93Die, most like.\'94 Tyrion stooped to g
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t another stick. \'93You don\'92t think I\'92d do it?\'94 \
\'93You\'92d do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were qui
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k enough to silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly.\'94 Bronn had yanked back the man\'92s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed of his wound. \
\'93He was good as dead,\'94 Bronn said, \'93and his moaning was bringing them down on us. Chiggen would have done the same for me . . . and he was no friend, only a man I rode with. Make no mistake, dwarf. I fought for you, but I do not love you.\'94 \
\'93It was your blade I needed,\'94 Tyrion said, \'93not your love.\'94 He dumped his armful of wood on the ground. \
Bronn grinned. \'93You\'92re bold as any sellsword, I\'92ll g
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ve you that. How did you know I\'92d take your part?\'94 \
\'93Know?\'94 Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 re. \'93I tossed the dice. Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive. Why? The others saw it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t you two. You had no lord, no 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 uty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve yourselves?\'94 He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks he\'92d gathered, to serve as kindling. \'93Well, why do sellswords do anything? For gold. You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here, that sh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld do, I hope. Do you have a flint?\'94 \
Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tos
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ed down a flint. Tyrion caught it in the air. \
\'93My thanks,\'94 he said. \'93The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a \
proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that\'92s the most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.\'94 Tyrion struck the flint against his dagger, trying for a spark. Nothing. \
Bronn snorted. \'93You have a bold tongue, little man. One day someone is 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ike to cut it out and make you eat it.\'94 \
\'93Everyone tells me that.\'94 Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword. \'93Did I offend you? My pardons . . . but you are scum, Bronn, make no
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what\'92s that to you? No, don\'92t trouble yourself, we both know the ans
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 er. Still, you\'92re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you . . . but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 know where your best interest lay. Happily for me, you did.\'94 He slammed stone and steel together again, fruitlessly. \
\'93Here,\'94 said Bronn, 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 quatting, \'93I\'92ll do it.\'94 He took the knife and flint from Tyrion\'92s hands and struck sparks on his first try. A curl of bark began to smolder. \
\'93Well done,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Scum you may be, but you\'92re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you\'92re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d you\'92ll have it.\'94 \
Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. \'93And if you die?\'94 \
\'93Why then, I\'92ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,\'94 Tyrion said, grinning. \'93The gold ends 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hen I do.\'94 \
The fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his pouch, and tossed Tyrion his 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 agger. \'93Fair enough,\'94 he said. \'93My sword\'92s yours, then . . . but don\'92t go looking for me to bend the knee and m\'92lord you every time you take a shit. I\'92m no man\'92s toady.\'94 \
\'93Nor any man\'92s friend,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93I\'92ve no doubt yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 \'92d betray me as quick as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it. If the day ever comes when you\'92re tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronn\'97I\'92ll match their price, whatever it is. I like living. And now, do you think you could do something about finding us some supper?\'94 \
\'93Take care of the horses,\'94 Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip. He strode into the trees. \
An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed, the fire was crackling away merrily, and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames, spitting and hissing. \'93All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid,\'94 Tyrion said. \
\'93That, a woman, and another dozen swords,\'94 Bronn
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said. He sat cross-legged beside the fire, honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel. \'93It will be full dark soon,\'94 the sellsword pointed out. \'93I\'92ll take first watch . . . for all the good it will do us. It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep.\'94 \
\'93Oh, I imagine they\'92ll be here long before it comes t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  sleep.\'94 The smell of the roasting meat made Tyrion\'92s mouth water. \
Bronn watched him across the fire. \'93You have a plan,\'94 he said flatly, with a scrape of steel on stone. \
\'93A hope, call it,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Another toss of the dice.\'94 \
\'93With our lives as the stake?\'94 \
Tyrion shrugged. \'93What choice do we have?\'94 He lean
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid. \'93Ahhhh,\'94 he sighed happily as he chewed. Grease ran down his chin. \'93A bit tougher than I\'92d like, and in want of spicing, but I\'92ll not complain too loudly. If I were back at the Eyrie, I\'92d be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean.\'94 \
\'93And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,\'94 Bronn said. \'93A Lannister always pays his debts.\'94 \
Even Mord had scarcely believed 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t
\f3  whe
\f1 n Tyrion tossed him the leather purse. The gaoler\'92s eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstrin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  and behel
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the glint of gold. \'93I kept the silver,\'94 Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile, \'93but you were pr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 mised the gold, and there it is.\'94 It was more than a man like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners. \'93And remember what I said, this is only a taste. If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn\'92s service, present yourself at Casterly Rock, and I\'92ll pay you the rest of what I owe you.\'94 With golden dragons spilling out of both hands, Mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that. \
Bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire. He began to carve thick chunks of charred meat off the b
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne as Tyrion hollowed out
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 two heels of stale bread to \
serve as trenchers. \'93If we do reach the river, what will you do then?\'94 the sellsword asked as he cut. \
\'93Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start.\'94 Tyrion held out his trencher, and Bronn filled it with meat. \'93And then to Casterly Ro
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k or King\'92s Landing, I think. I have some questions that want answering, concerning a certain dagger.\'94 \
The sellsword chewed and swallowed. \'93So you were telling it true? It wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  not your knife?\'94 Tyrion smiled thinly. \'93Do I look a liar to you?\'94 \
By the time their bellies were full, the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over the mountains. Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow. \'93Our friends are taking their sweet time.\'94 \
\'93If I were them, I\'92d fear a trap,\'94 Bronn said. \'93Why else would we be so open, if not to lure them in?\'94 \
Tyrion chuckled. \'93Then we ought to sing and send them flee
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng in terror.\'94 He began to whistle a tune. \
\'93You\'92re mad, dwarf,\'94 Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk. \
\'93Where\'92s your love of music, Br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nn?\'94\
\'93If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion you.\'94 \
Tyrion grinned. \'93That would have been amusing. I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his woodharp.\'94 He re
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 umed his whistling. \'93Do you know this song?\'94 he asked. \
\'93You hear it here and there, in inns and whorehouses.\'94 \
\'93Myrish. \'91The Seasons of My Love.\'92 Sweet and sad, if you understand the words. The first girl 
\f3 I e
\f1 ver bedded used to sing it, and I\'92ve never been able to put it out of my head.\'94 Tyrion gazed up at t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e
\f3  sky. 
\f1 It was a clear cold night and the stars
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth. \'93I met her on a night like this,\'94 he heard himself saying. \'93Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when we heard a scream, and she came running out into the road with 
\f3 two men do
\f1 gging her heels, shouting threats. My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them, while I dismounted to protect the girl. She was scarcely a year older than I was,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dark-haired, slender, with a \
face that would break your heart. It certainly broke mine. Lowborn, half-starved, unwashed . . . yet lovely. They\'92d torn the rag
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  she was wearing half off her back, so I wr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 pped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods. By the time he came trotting back, I\'92d gotten a name out of her, and a story. She was a crofter\'92s child, orphaned when her father died of fever, on her way to . . . well, nowher
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , really. \
\'93Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men. It was not often outlaws dared prey on travelers so near to Casterly Rock, and he took it as an insult. The girl was too frightened to send off by herself, though, so I offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her while my bro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her rode back to the Rock for help. \
\'93She was hungrier than I would have believe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . We finished two whole chickens and part of a third, and drank a flagon of wine, talking. I was only thirteen, and the wine went to my head, I fear. The next thing I knew, I was sharing her bed. If she was shy, I was shyer. I\'92ll never know where I found the courage. When I broke her maidenhead, she wept, but afterward she kissed me and 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ang her little song, and by morning I was in love.\'94 \
\'93You?\'94 Bronn\'92s voice was amused.\
\'93Absurd, isn\'92t it?\'94 Tyrion began to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 whistle the song again. \'93I married her,\'94 he finally \
admitted. \
\'93A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter\'92s daughter,\'94 Bronn said. \'93How did you manage that?\'94 \
\'93Oh, you\'92d be astonished at what a boy can make of 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  few lies, fifty pieces of silver, and a drunken septon. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set her up in a cottage of her own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife. And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father.\'94 Tyrion was surprised at how desolate it made
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him feel to say it, even after all these years. Perhaps he was just tired. \'93That was the end of my marriage.\'94 He s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t up and stared at the dying fire, blinking at the light. \
\'93He sent the girl away?\'94 \
\'93He did better than that,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93First he made my brother tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime arranged
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the whole affair, the road, the outlaws, all
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 f i
\f1 t. He thought it was time I had a woman. He paid double for a maiden, knowing it would be my first time. \
\'93After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  wife in and gave her to his guards. They paid her fair enough. A silver for each ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , how \
many whores command that high a price? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 gers and rolling on the floor, she . . . \'94 The smoke was stinging his eyes. Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into darkness. \'93Lord Tywin had me go last,\'94 he said in a quiet voice. \'93And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth more.\'94 \
After a time he heard the noise again, the 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 asp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened his sword. \'93Thirteen or thirty or three, I would have killed the man w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 o did that to me.\'94 \
Tyrion swung around to face him. \'93You may get that chance one day. Remember what I told you. A Lannister always pays his debts.\'94 He yawned. \'93I think I will try and sleep. Wake me i
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  we\'92re about to die.\'94 \
He rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes. The ground was stony and cold, bu
\f2\fs24 t
\f1 \cf3  after a \cf2 ti\cf3 me Tyrion Lanniste\cf2 r \cf3 did s
\f2 \cf2 l
\f1 \cf3 eep. He d\cf2 re\cf3 amt of the sky cel\cf2 l.\cf3  This
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 time he
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was the gaoler, not the prisoner, big, with a strap in his hand, and he was hitting his father, driving him back, toward the abyss . . . \
\'93Tyrion.\'94 Bronn\'92s warning was low and urgent. \
Tyrion was awake in the blink of an eye. The fire had burned down to embers, and the shadows were creeping in all around them. Bronn had raised himself to one knee, his sword in one hand and his 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 irk in the other. Tyrion held up a hand: stay still, it said. \'93Come share our fire, the night is cold,\'94 he called out to the creeping shadows. \'93I fear we\'92ve no wine to offer you, but you\'92re welcome to some of our goat.\'94 \
All movement stopped. Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal. \'93Our mountain,\'94 a voice called out from the trees, deep and hard and unfriendly. \'93Our goat.\'94 \
\'93Your goat,\'94 Tyrion agreed. \'93Who 
\f3 are you?\'94 \
\'93When you meet y
\f1 our gods,\'94 a different voice replied, \'93say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them.\'94 A branch cracke
\f3 d underfoot as he stepped in
\f1 to the light; a thin man
\f3  in a horned helmet, armed with a long 
\f1 kn
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 fe. \
\'93And Shagga son of Dolf.\'94 That was the first voice, deep and deadly. A boulder shifted to their left, and stood, and became a man. Massive and slow and strong he seemed, dressed all in skins, with a club in his right hand and an axe in his left. He smashed them together as he lumbered closer. \
Other voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion \
forgot the instant he heard them; ten at least. A few had swords and knives; others brandished pitchforks and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 scythes and 
\f3 wooden
\f1  spears. He waited until they were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer. \'93I am Tyrion son of Tywin, of the Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock. We will gladly pay you for the goat we ate.\'94 \
\'93What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?\'94 a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ked the one who named himself Gunthor, who seemed to be their chief. \
\'93There is silver in my purse,\'94 Tyrion told them. \'93This hauberk I wear is large for me, but it should fit Conn nicely,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 nd the b
\f1 attle-axe I carry would suit Shagga\'92s mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds.\'94 \
\'93The halfman would pay u
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  with our own coin,\'94 said Conn. \
\'93Conn speaks truly,\'94 Gunthor said. \'93Your silver is ours. Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ur horses are ours. Your hauberk and your battle-axe and the knife at your belt, those are ours too. You have nothing to give us but your lives. How would you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?\'94 \
\'93In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden\'92s mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty,\'94 he replied. \
The huge one, Shagga, laughed first and loud
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 st. The others seemed less amused. \'93Conn, take their horses,\'94 Gunthor commanded. \'93Kill the other and seize the halfinan. He can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh.\'94 \
Bronn sprang to his feet. \'93Who dies first?\'94 \
\'93No!\'94 Tyrion said sharply. \'93Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me. My House is rich a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d powerful. If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father will shower you wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h gold.\'94 \
\'93The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman\'92s promises,\'94 Gunthor said. \
\'93Half a man I may be,\'94 Tyrion said, \'93yet I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone Crows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale ride by?\'94 \
Shagga gave a roar of anger and clashed club against axe.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Jaggot poked at Tyrion\'92s face with the fire-hardened point of a long wooden spear. He did his best not to flinch. \'93A
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e these the best weapons you could stea
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 he said. \'93Good enough for killing sheep, perhaps . . . if the sheep do not fight back. My father\'92s smiths shit better steel.\'94 \
\'93Little boyman,\'94 Shagga roared, \'93will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed it to the goats?\'94 \
But Gunthor raised a hand. \'93No. I would hear his words. The mothers go hungry, and steel fills more mouths than gold. What would you give us for your lives, Tyrion son of Tywin? Swords? Lances? Mail?\'94 \
\'93All that, and more, Gunthor son of Gurn,\'94 Tyrion
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Lannister replie
\f3 d, sm
\f1 iling. \'93I will give you the Vale of Arryn.\'94 \

EDDARD \
Through the high narrow windows of the Red Keep\'92s cavernous throne room, the light of sunset spilled across the floor, laying dark red stripes upon the walls where the heads of dragons had once hung. Now the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with greens and browns and blues, and yet still it seemed to Ned Stark that the only color in the hall was the red of blood. \
He sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal. It was, as Robert had w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rned him, a hellishly uncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 attered leg throbbing more sharply every minute. The metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back. A king should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he commanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies. Damn Aegon for his arrogance, Ned t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well. \
\'93You are quite certain these were more than brigands?\'94 Varys asked softly from the council table beneath the throne. Grand Maester Pycelle stirred uneasily beside him, while Little
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 inger toyed with a pen. They were the only councillors in attendance. A white hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and Lord Renly and Ser Barristan had joined the king to hunt it, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, Balon Swann, and half the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in his absence. \
At least he could sit. Save t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e petitioners clustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries, the smallfolk in the gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or grey: all stood. \
The villager
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, their faces drawn by fear. The three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood behind them. \
\'93Brigands, Lord Varys?\'94 Ser Raymun Darry\'92s voice dripped scorn. \'93Oh, they were brigands, beyond a doubt. Lannister brigands.\'94 \
Ned could feel the unease in the hall, as high lords and servants alike strained to listen. \
He could not pretend to surprise. The west had been a tinderbox since Catelyn had seized Tyrion Lannister. Both Riverrun and Casterly Rock had called their banners, and armies were massing in the pass below the Golden Tooth. It had only 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 een a matter of time until the blood began to flow. The sole question that remained was how best to stanch the wound. \
Sad-eyed Ser Karyl Vance, who would have been handsome but for the winestain birthmark that discolored his face, gestured at the kneeling villagers. \'93This is all the 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 emains of the holdfast of Sherrer, Lord Eddard. The rest are dead, along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummer\'92s Ford.\'94 \
\'93Rise,\'94 Ned commanded the villagers. He never trusted what a man told him from his knees. \'93All 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f you, up.\'94 \
In ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to its feet. One ancient needed to be helped, and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees, staring blankly at Ser Arys Oakheart, who stood by the foot of the throne in the whi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e armor of the Kingsguard, ready to protect and defe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the king . . . or, Ned supposed, the King\'92s Hand. \
\'93Joss,\'94 Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer\'92s apron. \'93Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer.\'94 \
Joss nodded. \'93If it please His Grace\'97\'94 \
\'93His Grace is hunting across th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Blackwater,\'94 Ned said, wondering how a man could live his whole life a few days ride from the Red Keep and still
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 have no notion what his king looked like. Ned was clad in a 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hite linen doublet with the direwolf of Stark on the breast; his black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by his silver hand of office. Black and white and grey, all the shades of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 truth. \'93I am Lord Eddard Stark, the King\'92s Hand. Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders.\'94 \
\'93I keep . . . I kept . . . I kept an alehouse, m\'92lord, in Sherrer, by the stone bridge. The fin
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 st ale south of the Neck, everyone said so, begging your pardons, m\'92lord. It\'92s gone now like all the rest, m\'92lord. They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they\'92d caught me. M\'92lord.\'94 \
\'93They burnt us out,\'94 a farmer beside him said. \'93Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r
\f3 ed the fields
\f1  and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them. They weren\'92t no raide
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s, though, m\'92lord. They had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows.\'94 \
\'93They rode down my \'92prentice boy,\'94 said a squat man with a smith\'92s muscles and a \
bandage around his head. He had pu
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  on his finest clothes to come to court, but his breeches were patched, his cloak travel-stained and dusty. \'93Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screamin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  till the big one pierced him clean through.\'94 \
The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne. \'93They killed my mother too, Your Grace. And they . . . they . . . \'94 Her voice tr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 iled off, as if she had forgotten what she was about to say. She began to sob. \
Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale. \'93At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against the wood and 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 urnt them all alive. When the Wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running out, even women with suckling
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 babes.\'94 \
\'93Oh, dreadful,\'94 murmured Varys. \'93How cruel can 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 en be?\'94 \
\'93They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast\'92s made
\f3  of s
\f1 tone,\'94 Joss said. \'93Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as riper fruit upriver, and they made for the Mummer\'92s Ford.\'94 \
Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 leaned forward. Between each finger was a blade, the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne. Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken a thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread. The hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was this hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal; a chair that could kill a man, and had, if th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  stories could be believed. \
What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend, yet there he sat, and these people looked to him for justice. \'93What proof do you have that these were Lannisters?\'94 he asked, trying to keep his fury under control. \'93Did the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?\'94 \
\'93Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,\'94 Ser Marq Piper snapped. He was a swaggering bantam rooster of a youth, too young and too hot-blooded for Ned\'92s taste, though a fast friend of Catelyn\'92s brother, Edmure Tully. \
\'93Every man
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,\'94 Ser Karyl answered calmly. \'93They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the butchering.\'94 He gestured toward one of the ragged survivors. \'93You. Yes, you, no one\'92s \
going to hurt you. Tell the Hand what you told me.\'94 \
The old man bobb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d his head. \'93Concerning their horses,\'94 he said, \'93it were warhorses they rode. Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum\'92s stables, so I knows the difference. Not a one of these ever p
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 lled a plow, god
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  bear witness if I\'92m wrong.\'94 \
\'93Well-mounted brigands,\'94 observed Littlefinger. \'93Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided.\'94 \
\'93How many men were ther
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28  in this raiding party?\'94 Ned asked. \
\'93A hundre
\f1 d, at the least,\'94 Joss ans
\f3 wered, in the same instant as the bandaged smith said, \'93Fifty,\'94 and the gran
\f1 dmother behind him, \'93Hunnerds and hunnerds, m\'92lord, an army they was.\'94 \
\'93You are more right than you know, goodwoman,\'94 Lord Eddard told her. \'93You say they flew no banners. What of the armor they wore? Did any of yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  note ornaments or decorations, devices on shield or helm?\'94 \
The brewer, Joss, shook his head. \'93It grieves me, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 \'92lord, but no, the armor they showed us was plain, only . . . the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was no mistaking him all the same. It was the size of him, m\'92lord. Those as say the giants are all dead never sa
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  this one, I swear. Big as an ox he was, and a voice like stone breaking.\'94 \
\'93The Mountain!\'94 Ser Marq said loudly. \'93Can any man doubt it? This was Gregor Clegane\'92s work.\'94 \
Ned
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 heard muttering from beneath the windows
\f1  and the far end of the hall. Even in the galley, nervous whispers were exchanged. High lords and smallfolk alike knew what it could mean if Ser Marq was proved right. Ser Gregor Clegane stood bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. \
He studied the frightened faces of the villagers. Small wonder they had been so fearful; they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed butcher before a king who w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s his son by marriage. He wondered if the knights had given them a choice. \
Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, his chain of office clinking. \'93Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor. There are many large men in the realm.\'94 \
\'93A
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  large as the Mountain That Rides?\'94 Ser Karyl said. \'93I have never met one.\'94 \
\'93Nor has any man here,\'94 Ser Raymu
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  adde
\f3 d hotly
\f1 . \'93Even his brother is a pup beside him. My lords, open your eyes. Do you need to see his seal on the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 corpses? It was Gregor.\'94 \
\'93Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?\'94 Pycelle asked. \'93By the grace of his liege lord, he holds a stout keep and lands of his own. The man is an anointed k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ight.\'94 \
\'93A false knight!\'94 Ser Marq said. \'93Lord Tywin\'92s mad dog.\'94 \
\'93My lord Hand,\'94 Pycelle declared in a stiff voice, \'93I urge 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin Lanniste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  is the father of our own gracious queen.\'94 \
\'93Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,\'94 Ned said. \'93I fear we might have fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 gotten that if you h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d not pointed it out.\'94 \
From his vantage point atop the throne, he could see men slipping out the do
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r at the far end of the hall. Hares going to ground, he supposed . . . or rats off to nibble the queen\'92s cheese. He caught a glimpse of Septa Mordane in the gallery, with his daughter Sansa beside her. Ned felt a flash of anger; this was no place for a girl. But the septa could not have known that today\'92s court would be anything but the usual tedious business of hearing petitions, settling disputes between rival holdfasts, and adjudicating the placement of boundary stones. \
At the council table below, Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward. \'93Ser Marq, Ser Karyl, Ser Raymun\'97perhaps I might ask you a question? These holdfasts were under your protection. Where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on?\'94 \
Ser Karyl Vance answered. \'93I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth, as was Ser Marq. When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 ully, he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what surv
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 v
\f3 ors we could
\f1  and bring them to the king.\'94 \
Ser Raymun Darry spoke up. \'93Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength. I was camped across the river from his walls, awaiting his commands, when the word reached me. By the time I could return to my own lands, Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannister\'92s hills.\'94 \
Littlefinger stroked the point of h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s beard thoughtfully. \'93And if they come again, ser?\'94 \'93If they come again, we\'92ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt,\'94 Ser Marq Piper \
declared hotly. \
\'93Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 thin a day\'92s ride of the border,\'94 Ser Karyl explained. \'93Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  next raider will not have such an easy time of it.\'94 \
And that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants, Ned thought to himself, to bleed off strength from Riverrun, goad the boy into scattering his swords. His wife\'92s brother was young, and more gallant than wi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e. He would try to hold every inch of his soil, to defend every man, woman, and child who named him lord, and Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that. \
\'93If your fie
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ds and holdfasts are safe from harm,\'94 Lord Petyr was saying, \'93what then do y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u ask of the throne?\'94 \
\'93The lords of the Trident keep the king\'92s peace,\'94 Ser Raymun Darry said. \'93The Lannisters have broken it. We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel. We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish Town and the Mummer\'92s Ford.\'94 \
\'93Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin,\'94 Ser Marq declared, \'93but old Lord Hoster commanded us to come here and beg the king\'92s leave before we strike.\'94 \
Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster, then. Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion. If indeed he\'92d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage\'97and Ned did not doubt that he had\'97 he\'92d taken care to see that he rode under cover of night, without banners, in the guise of a commo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  brigand. Should Riverrun strike back, Cersei and her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who bro
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e the king\'92s peace, not the Lannisters. The gods only knew what Robert would believe. \
Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again. \'93My lord Hand, if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint. These crimes are no concern of the throne. Le
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  them seek Lord Tywin\'92s justice.\'94 \
\'93It is all the king\'92s justice,\'94 Ned told him. \'93North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in Robert\'92s name.\'94 \
\'93The king\'92s justice,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle said. \'93So it is, and so w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  should defer this matter until the king\'97\'94 \
\'93The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,\'94 Lord Eddard said. \'93Robert bid me to sit here in his place, to listen with his ears, and to speak with hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  voice. \
I mean to do just that . . . though I agree that he must be told.\'94 He saw a familiar face bene
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 th the tapestries. \'93Ser Robar.\'94 \
Ser Robar Royce stepped f
\f3 orw
\f1 ard and bowed. \'93My lord.\'94 \
\'93Your father is hunting with the king,\'94 Ned said. \'93Will you bring them word of what was 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid and done here today?\'94 \
\'93At once, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?\'94 Marq Piper asked the t
\f3 hro
\f1 ne. \
\'93Vengeance?\'94 N
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d said. \'93I thought we were speaking of justice. Burning Clegane\'92s fields and slaughtering his peo
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 le will not restore the king\'92s peace, only your injured pride.\'94 He glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest, and addressed the villagers. \'93People of Sherrer, I cannot give you back your homes or your crops, nor can I restore your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dead to life. But perhaps I can give you some small measure of justice, in the name of our king, Robert.\'94 \
Every eye in the hall was fixed on him, waiting. Slowly Ned struggled to his feet, pushing himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms, his shattered leg screaming inside its cast
\f3 . He 
\f1 did his best to i
\f2\fs24 g
\f1 \cf3 nore the \cf2 pa\cf3 in; it was no mome\cf2 nt\cf3  to l
\f2 \cf2 e
\f1 \cf3 t them se\cf2 e \cf3 his weakness. \'93The\cf2  F\cf3 irst 
\f2 \cf2 M
\f0\b\fs38 en bel
\f2\b0\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 eved that the judge who called for death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still. I mislike sending another to do my \
k
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 lling . . . yet it seems I have no choice.\'94 He gestured at his broken leg. \
\'93Lord Eddard!\'94 The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of a boy strode forth boldly. Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than his sixteen years. He wore pale blue silk
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  his belt a linked chain of golden roses, the sigil of his House. \'93I beg you the honor of acting in your place. Give thi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  task
\f3  to 
\f1 me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you.\'94 \
Littlef
\f3 inger chu
\f1 ckled. \'93Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 retty mouth of yours. The Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man\'92s justice.\'94 \
\'93I do not fear Gregor Clegane,\'94 Ser Loras said haughtily. \
Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon\'92s misshapen throne. His eyes 
\f3 searche
\f1 d the faces along the wall. \'93Lord Beric,\'94 he called out. \'93Thoros of Myr. Ser Gladden. Lord Lothar.\'94 The men named stepped forward one by one. \'93Each of y
\f3 ou is to
\f1  \
assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor\'92s keep. Twenty of my own guards shall go with you. Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the command, as befits your rank.\'94 \
The young lord with the red-gold hair bowed. \'93As y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u command, Lord Eddard.\'94 \
Ned raised his voice, so it carried to the far end of the throne room. \'93In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd of Eddard of the Hou
\f3 se St
\f1 ark, his Hand, I charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king\'92s flag, and there bring the king\'92s ju
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death. May the gods take pity on his soul.\'94 \
When the echo of his words had died away, the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed. \'93Lord Eddard, what of me?\'94 \
Ned looked down on him. From on high, Loras Tyrell 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 eemed almost as young as Robb. \'93No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at you seek is vengeance.\'94 He looked back to Lord Beric. \'93Ride at first light. These things are 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 est done quickly.\'94 He held up a hand. \'93The throne will hear no more petitions today.\'94 \
Alyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down. As they made their d
\f3 escent,
\f1  he could feel Loras Tyrell\'92s sullen stare,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
At the base of the Iron Throne, Varys was gathering papers from the council table. Littlefi
\f3 nge
\f1 r and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave. \'93You are a bolder man than I, my lord,\'94 the eunuch said softly. \
\'93How so, Lord Varys?\'94 Ned asked brusquely. His leg was throbbing, and he was in no mood for word games. \
\'93Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras. He so wanted to go . . . and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 riends.\'94 \
\'93Ser Loras is young,\'94 said Ned. \'93I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.\'94\
\'93And Ser Ilyn?\'94 The eunuch stroked a plump, powdered cheek. \'93He is the King\'92s Justice, \
after all. Sending other men to do his office . . . some might construe that as a grave insult.\'94 \
\'93No slight was intended.\'94 In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners. \'93I remind you, the Paynes
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 are bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty.\'94 \
\'93Very
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 prudent, no doubt,\'94 Varys said. \'93Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight. I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well. He does so love his work . . . \'94 \

SANSA \
He wouldn\'92t send Ser Loras,\'94 Sansa told Jeyne Poole that night as they shared a cold supper by lamplight. \'93I think it was because of his leg.\'94 \
Lord Eddard had tak
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n his supper in his bedchamber with Alyn, Harwin, and Vayon Poole, the better to rest his broken leg, and Septa Mordane had complained of sore feet after standing in the gallery all day.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Arya was supposed to join them, but she was late coming back from her dancing lesson. \
\'93His leg?\'94 Jeyne said uncertainly. She was a pretty, dark-haired girl of Sansa\'92s own age. \'93Did Ser Loras hurt his leg?\'94 \
\'93Not his leg,\'94 Sansa said, nibbling delicat
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ly at a chicken leg.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Father\'92s leg, silly. It hurts him ever so much, it makes him cross. Otherwise I\'92m certain he would have sent Ser Loras.\'94 \
Her father\'92s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, she\'92d been sure she was about to see one of Old Nan\'92s stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father had refused him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only told her it was not her place to question her lord father\'92s decisions. \
That was when Lord Baelish had said, \'93Oh, I don\'92t know, Septa. Some of her lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 father\'92s decisions could do with a bit of q
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 estioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.\'94 He made a sweeping bow to Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure if she was being complimented or mocked. \
Septa M
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rdane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them. \'93The girl was just talking, my lord,\'94 she\'92d said. \'93Foolish chatter. She meant nothing by the comment.\'94 \
Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, \'93Nothing? Tell me, ch
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ld, why would you have sent Ser Loras?\'94 \
Sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king\'92s councillor smiled. \'93Well, those are not the reasons I\'92d have given, but . . . \'94 He had touched her cheek, his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone. \'93Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\'94 \
Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy just to think back on it. \
\'93Ser Ilyn\'92s the King\'92s Justice, not Ser Loras,\'94 Jcyne said. \'93Lord Eddard should have sent him.\'94 \
Sansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her feel as though something dead were slithe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ing over her naked skin. \'93Ser Ilyn\'92s almost like a second monster. I\'92m glad Father didn\'92t pick him.\'94 \
\'93Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras. He\'92s ever so brave and gallant.\'94 \
\'93I suppose,\'94 Sansa sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but he was awfully old, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of course, Jeyne had been in love with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in the lists. Sansa thought she was being 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 illy; Jeyne was only a steward\'92s daughter, after all, and no matter how much she mooned after him, Lord Beric would never look at someone so far beneath him, even if she hadn\'92t been half his age. \
It would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject. \'93I had a d
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eam that Joffrey would be the one to take the white hart,\'94 she said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a dream. Everyone knew that dreams we
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e prophetic. White harts were supp
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 sed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 orthier than his drunken father. \
\'93A dream? Truly? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 
\f3 Sans
\f1 a s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. \'93He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.\'94 In the songs, the knights never killed magical 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 easts, they just went up to them and touched them and did them no harm, but she knew Joffrey liked hunti
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g, especially the killing part. Only animals, though. Sansa was certain her prince had no part in murdering Jory and those other poor men; that had been his wicked uncle, the Kingslayer. She knew her father was still angry about that, but it wasn\'92t fair to blame Joff. That would be like blaming her for som
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 thing that Arya had done. \
\'93I saw your sister this af
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ernoon,\'94 Jeyne blurted out, as if she\'92d been reading Sansa\'92s thoughts. \'93She was walking through the stables on her hands. Why would she do a thing like that?\'94 \
\'93I\'92m sure I don\'92t know why Arya does 
\f3 anything
\f1 .\'94 Sansa hated stables, smelly places full of manure and
\f3  fli
\f1 es. Even when she 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ent riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard. \'93Do you want to hear abou
\f3 t the co
\f1 ur
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  or not?\'94 \
\'93I do,\'94 Jeyne said. \
\'93There was a black brother,\'94 Sansa said, \'93begging men for the Wall, only
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he was kind of old and smelly.\'94 She hadn\'92t liked that at all. She had always imagined the Night\'92s Watch to be men like Uncle Benjen. In the songs, they were called the black knights of the Wall. But this man had been crookbacked and hideous, and he looked as t
\f3 hough
\f1  he might have lice. If this was what the Night\'92s Watch was truly like, she felt sorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. \'93Father asked if there were any knights in the hall who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so he gave this Yoren his pick of the king\'92s dungeons and sent him on 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is way. And later these two brothers came before him, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledg
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d their swords to the service of the king. Father accepted their oaths . . . \'94 \
Jeyne yawned. \'93Are there any lemon cakes?\'94 \
Sansa did not like being interrupted, but she had to admit, lemon cakes sounded more interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room. \'93Let\'92s see,\'94 she said. \
The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberr
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  pie, and that was almost as good. They ate it on the to
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 er steps, giggling and gossiping and sharing secrets, and Sansa went to bed that night feeling almost as wicked as Arya. \
The next morning she woke be
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ore first light and crept sleepily to her window to watch Lord Beric form up his men. They rode out as dawn was breaking over the city, with three banners going before them; the crowned stag of the king flew from the high staff, the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric\'92s 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wn forked lightning standard from shorter poles. It was all so exciting, a song come to life; the clatter of swords, the flicker of torchlight, banners dancing in the wind, horses snorting and whinnying, the golden glow of sunrise slanting through the bars of the po
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 tcullis as it jerked upward. The Winterfell men looked especially fine in their silvery mail and long grey cloaks. \
Alyn carried the Stark banner. When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to exchange words, it made Sansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory had been; he was goin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  to be a knight one day. \
The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to s
\f3 ee Arya wh
\f1 en she went down to break her fast. \'93Where is everyone?\'94 her sister wanted to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 k
\f3 now as
\f1  she ripped the skin from a blood orange. \'93Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?\'94 \
Sansa sighed. \'93They rode with Lord Beric, 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o behead Ser G
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 egor Clegane.\'94 She turned to Septa Mordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. \'93Septa, will Lord Beric
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 spike Ser Gregor\'92s head on his own gate or bring it b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck here for the king?\'94 She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that last night. \
The septa was horror-s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ruck. \'93A lady does not discuss such things over h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r porridge. Where are your courtesies, 
\f3 Sansa
\f1 ? I swear, of late you\'92ve been near as bad as your si
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ter.\'94 \
\'93What did Gregor do?\'94 Arya asked. \
\'93He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d children too.\'94 \
Arya screwed up her face in a scowl. \'93Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d Wyl
\f3 , and
\f1  the Hound murdered Mycah. Somebody should have beheaded them.\'94 \
\'93It\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 not the same,\'94 Sansa said. \'93The Hound is Joffrey\'92s sworn shield. Your butcher\'92s boy attacked the prin
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e.\'94 \
\'93Liar,\'94 Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers. \
\'93Go ahead, call me all the names you want,\'94 Sansa said airily. \'93You won\'92t dare when I\'92m married to Joffrey. You\'92ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.\'94 She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap. \
\'93You have juice on your face, Your Grace,\'94 Arya said. \
It was running down her nose and stinging her ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s. Sansa wiped it away with a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in her lap had don
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  to her beautiful ivory silk dress, she shrieked again. \'93You\'92re horrible,\'94 she screamed at her sister. \'93They should have killed you instead of Lady!\'94 \
Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. \'93Your lord father will hear of this! Go to your chambers, at once. At once!\'94 \
\'93Me too?\'94 Tears wel
\f3 led in 
\f1 San
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 a\'92s eyes. \'93That\'92s not fair.\'94 \'93The matter is not subject to discussion. Go!\'94 \
Sansa stalked aw
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y with her head up. She was t
\f3 o be a queen, 
\f1 and queens did not cry. At least not where people could see. When she reached her bedchamber, she barred the door and took off her dress. The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. \'93I hate her!\'94 she screamed. She balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night\'92s fire. When 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he saw that the stain had bled through onto her underskirt, she began to sob despite herself. She ripped off the rest of her clothes wildly, threw herself into bed, and cried herself back to sleep. \
It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door. \'93Sansa. Your lord 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 athe
\f3 r w
\f1 ill see you now.\'94 \
Sansa sat up. \'93Lady,\'94 she whispered. For a mo
\f3 men
\f1 t it was as if the direwolf was there in the room, looking at her with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She had been dreaming, she realized. Lady was with her, and they were running together,\
and . . . and . . . trying to rem
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 mber was like trying to catch the rain with her fingers. The dream faded, and Lady was dead again. \
\'93Sansa.\'94 The rap came
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 again, sharply. \'93Do you hear me?\'94 \
\'93
\f3 Yes, 
\f1 Septa,\'94 she called out. \'93Might I have a moment to dress, please?\'94 Her eyes were red from crying, but she did her 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 est to make herself beautiful. \

\f3 Lord
\f1  Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched her into the solar, his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. \'93Come here, Sansa,\'94 he said, not unkindly, when the septa had gone for her sister. \'93Sit beside me.\'94 He closed the book. \
Septa Mordane returned with Arya squir
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ing in her grasp. Sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask gown and a look of remorse, but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun she\'92d worn at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 breakfast. \'93Here is the other one,\'94 the septa announced. \
\'93My thanks, Septa Mordane. I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so kind.\'94 The septa bowed and left. \
\'93Arya started it,\'94 Sansa said quickly, anxious to have the first word. \'93She called me 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  liar and threw an orange 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei \
gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey. Sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  hates that I\'92m going to marry the prince. She tries to spoil everything, Father, she can\'92t stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.\'94 \
\'93Enough, Sansa.\'94 Lord Eddard\'92s voice was sharp with impat
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 nce.\

\f1 Arya raised her eyes. \'93I\'92m sorry, Father. I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister\'92s \
forgiveness.\'94 \
Sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless. Finally she found her voice. \'93What a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1 \cf3 out my dr\cf2 es\cf3 s?\'94 \
\'93Maybe . . .\cf2  I\cf3  coul
\f2 \cf2 d
\f1 \cf3  wash it,\cf2 \'94 \cf3 Arya said doubtful\cf2 ly\cf3 . \
\'93
\f2 \cf2 W
\f0\b\fs38 ashing 
\f2\b0\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 on\'92t do any good,\'94 Sansa said. \'93Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.\'94 \
\'93Then I\'92ll . . . make you a new one,\'94 Arya said. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Sansa threw back her head in disdain. \'93You? You co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ldn\'92t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.\'94 \
Their father sighed. \'93I did not call you here to talk of dresses. I\'92m
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sending you both back to Winterfell.\'94 \
For the second time Sansa found herself too s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 unned for words. She felt her eyes grow moist again. \
\'93You can\'92t,\'94 Arya said.\
\'93Please, Father,\'94 Sansa managed at last. \'93Please don\'92t.\'94 \
Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile. \'93At last we\'92ve found something y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u agree on.\'94 \
\'93I didn\'92t do anything wrong,\'94 Sansa pleade
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  with him. \'93I don\'92t want to go back.\'94 She loved Mng\'92s Landing; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones, the great 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ity with all its people. The tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life, and there was so much she had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows. She could not bear the thought of losing it all. \'93Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it. I\'92ll be good, you\'92ll see, \
just let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen.\'94 \
Father\'92s m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uth twitched strangely. \'93Sansa, I\'92m not sending you away for fighting, though the gods know I\'92m sick of you two squabbling. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety. Three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit, and what does Rob
\f3 ert do? He goes hunting.\'94 
\f1 \
Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had. \'93Can we take Syrio back with us?\'94 \
\'93Who cares about your stupid dancing master?\'94 Sansa flared. \'93Father, I only just now remembered, I can\'92t go away, I\'92m to marry Prince Joffrey.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  She tried 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o smile bravely for him. \'93I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian. I want to be his queen and have his babies.\'94 \
\'93Sweet one,\'94 her father said gently, \'93listen to me. Whe
\f3 n yo
\f1 u\'92re old enough, I will 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ake you a match with a high lord who\'92s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.\'94 \
\'93He 
\f3 is!\'94 Sansa insisted. \'93I don\'92t want someone brave 
\f1 and gentle, I want him. We\'92ll be ever so happy, just like in the songs, you\'92ll see. I\'92ll give him a son wit
\f3 h golden hair, and one day he\'92ll be the 
\f1 king of all the real
\f3 m, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as pro
\f1 ud as the lion.\'94 \
Arya made a face. \'93Not if Joffrey\'92s his father,\'94 she said. \'93He\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  a liar and a craven and anyhow he\'92s a stag, not a lion.\'94 \
Sansa felt tears in her eyes. \'93He is not! He\'92s not the least bit like that old drunken king,\'94 she screamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief. \
Father looked at her strangely. \'93Gods,\'94 he swore softly, \'93out of the mouth of babes . . . \'94 He shouted for Septa Mordane. To the girls he said, \'93I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home. Thes
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  days, the sea is safer than the kingsroad. You will sail as 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 oon as I can find a proper ship, with Septa Mordane and a complement of \
guards . . . and yes, with Syrio Forel, if he agrees to enter my service. But say nothing of this. It\'92s better if no one knows of our plans. We\'92ll talk again tomorrow.\'94 \
Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 oing to take it all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, the
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was \
over before it had begun. \
\'93Stop that weeping, child,\'94 Septa Mordane said sternly. \'93I am certain your lord father knows what is best for you.\'94 \
\'93It won\'92t be so bad, Sansa,\'94 Arya said. \'93We\'92re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then we\'92ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.\'94 She touched her on the arm. \
\'93Hodor!\'94 Sansa yelled. \'93You ought to marry Hodor, you\'92re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!\'94 She wrenched away from her sister\'92s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 door behind her. \

EDDARD \
Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle told
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. \'93It means the bone is knitting, the flesh healing itself. Be thankful.\'94 \
\'93I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing.\'94 \
Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed. \'93The milk of the poppy, for when the p
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 in grows too onerous.\'94 \
\'93I sleep too much already.\'94 \'93Sleep 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s the great healer.\'94
\f3  \'93I 
\f1 had hoped that was you.\'94 \
Pycelle smiled wanly. \'93It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord.\'94 He leaned close and lowered his voice. \'93There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from her lord father. I thought you had best know.\'94 \
\'93Dark wings, da
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k words,\'94 Ned said grimly. \'93What of it?\'94 \
\'93Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane,\'94 the maeste
\f3 r confided. \'93I feared he would be. You will recall, I said as much in council.\'94 \
\'93Let him be wroth,\'94 Ned said. Every time his leg throbbed, h
\f1 e remembered Jaime Lannister\'92s smile, and Jory dead in his arms. \'93Let him write all the l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 tters to the queen he likes. Lord Beric rides beneath the king\'92s own banner. If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king\'92s justice, he will have Robert to answer to. The only thing His Grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him.\'94 \
Pycelle pulled back, his maester\'92s chain jangling.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93As you say. I shall visit again on the morrow.\'94 The old man hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave. Ned had little doubt that he was bound straight 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or the royal apartments, to whisper at the queen. I thought you had best know, indeed . . . as if Cersei had not instructed him to pass along her father\'92s threats. He hoped his response rattled those perfect teeth of hers. Ned was not near as confident of Robert as he pretended, but there was no reason Cersei need \
know that. \
When Pycelle was gone, Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine. That clouded the mind as well, yet not as badly. He needed to be able to think. A thousand times, he asked himself what Jon Arryn might have done, had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he lived long enough to act on what he\'92d learned. Or perhaps he had acted, and died for it. \
It was queer how sometimes a child\'92s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to. Somed
\f3 ay, when Sa
\f1 nsa was grown, he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him. He\'92s not the least bit like that old drunken king, she had declared, angry a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d unknowing, and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him, cold as death. This was the sword that killed Jon Arryn, Ned thought then, and it will kill Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain. Shattered legs may heal in time, but some betraya
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 s fester and poison the soul. \
Littlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 aester had left, clad in a plum- colored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread, and a striped cloak of black and white. \'93I cannot visit l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng, my lord,\'94 he announced. \'93Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her. No doubt she will roast me a fatted calf. If it\'92s near as fatted as her daughter, I\'92m like to rupture and die. And how is your leg?\'94 \
\'93Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad.\'94 \
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. \'93In future, try not to let any horses fall on it. I would urge you to heal quickly. The realm grows restive. Var
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 s has heard ominous whispers from the west. Freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the thin pleasure of 
\f3 Lord Tywin\'92s conversa
\f1 tion.\'94 \
\'93Is the
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e word of the king?\'94 Ned demanded. \'93Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?\'94 \
\'93Given his preferences, I believe he\'92d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age,\'94 Lord Petyr replied with a faint smile. \'93Lac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing that, I imagine he\'92ll return as soon as he\'92s killed something. They found the white hart, it seems . . . or rather, what remained of it. Some wolves found it first, and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn. Robert was in a fury, until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest. Then nothing would do but he must have it. Prince Joffrey returned this morning, with the Royces, Ser Balon Swann, and some twenty others of the party. The rest are still with the king.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93The Hound?\'94 Ned asked, frowning. Of all the Lannister party, Sandor Clegane was the one who concerned him the most, now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to joi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  his father. \
\'93Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen.\'94 Little
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 inger smiled. \'93I would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to behead his brother.\'94 \
\'93Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother.\'94 \
\'93Ah, but Gregor was his to loat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e, not yours to kill. Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain, the Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn\'92t hold my water waiting for his thanks, not that one. And
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now you must forgive me. Lady Tand
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  awaits with her fatted calves.\'94 \
On the way to the door, Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon\'92s massive tome on the table and paused to idly flip open the cover. \'93The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Noble Ladies and Their Children,\'93 he read. \'93Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it. A sleeping p
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 tion, my lord?\'94 \
For a brief mome
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t Ned considered telling him all of it, but there was something in Littlefinger\'92s japes that irked him. The man was too clever by half, a mocking smile never far from his lips. \'93Jon Arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick,\'94 Ned said in a careful tone, to see how he might respond. \
And he responded as he always did: with a quip. \'93In that case,\'94 he sai
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , \'93death must have come as a blessed relief.\'94 Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave. \
Eddard Stark allowed himself a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was scarcely a man in this city he trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in his inquiries, yet his haste to save his own skin when Jaime and his swords had come out of the rain still rankled. Varys was worse. For all his 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 rotestations of loyalty, the eunuch knew too much and did too little. Grand Maest
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Pycelle seemed more Cersei\'92s creature with every passing day, and Ser Barristan was an old man, and rigid. He would tell Ned to do his duty. \
Time was perilously short. The king would return from his hunt soon, and honor would require Ned to go to him with all he had learned. Vayon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Poole had arranged for Sansa and Arya to sail on the Wind Witch out of Braavos, three days hence. They would be back at Winterfell before the harvest. Ned could no longer use his concer
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  for their safety to excuse his delay. \
Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar\'92s children. Lord Tywin had laid t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. Th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t was clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The little princess \
had been barefoot, still dresse
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  in her bed gown, and the boy . . . the boy
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . . \
Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king, another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children. \
Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain hon
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rs and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  honor and respect due a valiant enemy. \
This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  could never forgive, no m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re than he ha
\f3 d forgiven Rhaegar. He will kill them all, Ned realized. \
And yet, he knew he could not keep silent. He had a duty to Robert, to the realm, to the shade 
\f1 of Jon A
\f3 rryn . . . and to Bran, who surely must have stumbled on some
\f1  part of the truth. Why else would they hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  tried to slay him? \
Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly gu
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 rdsman with the gi
\f1 nger- colored whiskers his children called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn gone, Fat Tom had command of his household guard. The thought filled Ned with vague disquiet. Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a limited way, but he was near fifty, and even in his youth he had never been energetic. Perhaps Ned should
\f3  not have been so quick to send off half his guard, and
\f1  all his best swords among them. \
\'93I shall require your help,\'94 Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly apprehensive, as he always did when called before his lord. \'93Take me to the godswood.\'94 \
\'93Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?\'94 \'93Perhaps not. But necessary
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Tomard summoned Varly. With one arm around each man\'92s shoulders, Ned managed t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey. \'93I want the guard doubled,\'94 he told Fat Tom. \'93No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand without my leave.\'94 \
Tom blinked. \'93M\'92lord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hard-pressed already\'97\'94 \'93It will only be a short while. Lengthen the watches.\'94\
\'93As you say, m\'92lord,\'94 Tom answered. \'93Might I ask why\'97\'94 \
\'93Best not,\'94 Ned answered crisply. \
The godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of the southron gods. Ned\'92s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree. \'93Thank you.\'94 He drew a paper from his sleeve, sealed with the sigil of his House. \'93Kindly deliver this at once.\'94 \
Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously. \'93My lord . . . \'94 \
\'93Do as I bid you, T
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 m,\'94 Ned said. \
How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here. The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the murmur 
\f3 of 
\f1 crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle w
\f3 ind. T
\f1 he 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his gods. His leg did not seem to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hurt so much. \
She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. S
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e came alone, as he had bid
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 h
\f3 er. F
\f1 or once she was dressed simply, in leather boots and hunting greens. When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak, he saw the bruise where the king had struck her. The angry plum color had faded to yellow, and the swelling was down, but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was. \
\'93Why here?\'94 Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him. \'93So the gods can see.\'94 \
She sat beside him on the grass. Her every move was graceful. Her curling blond hair moved in the wind, and her eyes were green as the l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 aves of summer. It had been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty, but he saw it now. \'93I know the truth Jon 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 r
\f3 ryn d
\f1 ied for,\'94 he told her. \
\'93Do you?\'94 The queen watched his face, wary as a cat. \'93Is that why you called me here, Lord Stark? To pose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my brother?\'94 \
\'93If you truly believed that, you would never have come.\'94 Ned touched her cheek gently. \'93Has he done this before?\'94 \
\'93Once or twice.\'94 She shied away from his hand. \'93Never on the 
\f3 face befor
\f1 e. Jaime would \
have
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 killed him, even if it meant his own life.\'94 Cerse
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28  looked at him defiantly. \'93My brother is worth a hundred of your friend.\'94 \
\'93Your brother?\'94 Ned said. \'93Or your lover?\'94 \
\'93Both.\'94 She did not flinch from the truth. \'93Since we were children together. And why not? The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep the bloodlines pure. And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one person in two bodies. We shared a womb together. He cam
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  into this world holding my foot, our old maester
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said. When he is in me, I feel . . . whole.\'94 The ghost of a smile flitted over her lips. \
\'93My son Bran . . . \'94\
To her credit, Cersei did not look away. \'93He saw us. You love your children, do you not?\'94 \
Robert had asked him the very same question, the morning of the melee. He gave her the same answer. \'93With all my heart.\'94 \
\'93No less do I love mine.\'94 \
Ned th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ught, If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon\'92s life, against the children of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would. \
\'93All three are Jaime\'92s,\'94 he said. It was not a question. \'93Thank the gods.\'94 \
The seed is strong, Jon Ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 yn had cried on his deathbed, and so it was. All those bastards, all with hair as black as night. Gra
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion, some ninety years ago, when Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 third son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an unnamed boy described in Malleon\'92s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair, died in infancy. Thirty ye

\f2 \cf2 a
\f0\b\fs38 d given h
\f2\b0\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m three daughters and a son, each black-haired. No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the coal. \
\'93A dozen years,\'94 Ned said. \'93How is it that you have had no children by the king?\'94 \
She lifted her head, defiant. \'93Your Robert got me with child once,\'94 she said, her voice thick with contempt. \'93My broth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r found a woman to cleanse me. He never knew. If truth be told, I can scarcely bear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me for years. I know other ways to pleasure him, when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber. Whatever we do, the ki
\f3 ng is usually so drunk that 
\f1 he\'92s forgotten it all by the next morning.\'94 \
How could they have all been so blind? The truth was there in front of them all the time, written 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n the children\'92s faces. Ned felt sick. \'93I remember Robert as he was the day he took the throne, every inch a king,\'94 he said quietly. \'93A thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts. What did he do to make you hate him so?\'94 \
Her eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was her sigil. \'93The night of our wedding feast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by your sister\'92s name. He 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as on top of me, in me, stinking of wine, and he whispered Lyanna.\'94 \
Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment he wanted to weep. \'93I do not know which of you I pity most.\'94 \
The queen seemed amused by that. \'93Save your pity for yourself, Lord Stark. I want none of it.\'94 \
\'93You know what I must do.\'94 \
\'93Must?\'94 She put her hand on his good leg, just above the knee. \'93A true man does what he will, not what he must.\'94 Her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fingers brushed lightly against his thigh, the gentlest of promises. \'93The realm needs a strong Hand. Joff will not come of age for years. No one wants war again, least of all me.\'94 Her hand touched his face, his hair. \'93If friends can turn to enemies, enemies can become friends. Your wife is a thousand leagues away, and my brother has fled. Be kind to me, Ned. I swear to you, you shall never regret it.\'94 \
\'93Did you make t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e same offer to Jon Arryn?\'94\
She slapped him.\
\'93I shall wear that as a badge of honor,\'94 Ned said dryly. \
\'93Honor,\'94 she spat. \'93How dare you play the noble lord with me! What do you take me for? You\'92ve a bastard of your own, I\'92ve seen him. Who was the mother, I wonder? Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving sister, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself into the sea, I\'92m told. Why was that
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  For the brother you slew, or the child you stole? Tell me, my honorable Lord Eddard, ho
\f3 w ar
\f1 e \
you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93For a start,\'94 said Ned, \'93I do not kill children. You would do well to listen, my lady. I shall say this only once. When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to
\f3  lay the tru
\f1 th
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 b
\f3 efore him. You must be go
\f1 ne by then. You and your children, all 
\f3 three, and not to Casterly
\f1  Rock. If I were you, I should take ship for the Free Cities, or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 even farther, to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben. As far as the winds blow.\'94 \
\'93Exile,\'94 she said. \'93A bitter c
\f3 up to drink from.
\f1 \'94 \
\'93A sweeter c
\f3 up than your father se
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 v
\f3 ed Rhaegar\'92s 
\f1 children,\'94 Ned said, \'93and kin
\f3 der than you deserve.
\f1  Your father and yo
\f3 ur brothers would do well 
\f1 to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 go with you. Lord Tywin\'92s gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe. You shall need them. I promise you, no matter where you flee, Robert\'92s wrath will follow you, to the back of beyond if need be.\'94 \
The queen stood. \'93And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?\'94 she asked softly. Her eyes searched his face. \'93You should have taken the realm for yourself. It was there for the taking. Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King\'92s Landing fell, and made him yield it up. That
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was your moment. All you needed to do was climb those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake.\'94 \
\'93I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine,\'94 Ned said, \'93but that was not one of them.\'94 \
\'93Oh, but it was, my lord,\'94 Cersei insisted. \'93When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.\'94 \
She turned up her hood
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark beneath the oak, amidst the quiet 
\f3 of th
\f1 e godswood, under a blue-black sky. The star
\f3 s were coming
\f1  out. \

DAENERYS \
The heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw and bloody. His arms were red to the elbow. Behind him, 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of the wild stallion, stone knives in their hands. 
\f3 The stall
\f1 ion\'92s blood looked black in the flickering 
\f3 orange 
\f1 glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit. \
Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or look afraid. I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself as she took
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the stallion\'92s heart in both hands, lifted it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 o her mouth, and plunged her teeth
\f1  into the tough, stringy flesh. \
Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  chin. The taste threatened to gag her, but she made herself chew and swallow. The heart of a sta
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 lion would make her son strong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could eat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the omens were less favora
\f3 ble; t
\f1 he child might be s
\f3 tillborn, or come forth
\f1  w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ak, deformed, or female. \
Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother\'92s stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made her chew strips of dried horse
\f3 flesh until h
\f1 er jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat. \
The wild stallion\'92s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it wit
\f3 h her tee
\f1 th and chew each mouthful a long time. No stee
\f3 l was
\f1  permitted within the sacred confines of Vaes Dothrak,
\f3  beneath 
\f1 the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach
\f3  roile
\f1 d and heaved, yet she kept on, her face s
\f3 meared with 
\f1 the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against her lips. \
Khal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  hard as a bronze shield. His long black braid was shiny with oil
\f3 . He wore
\f1  gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and
\f3  a heavy
\f1  belt of solid gold meda
\f3 llio
\f1 ns around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked at him whenever she felt her strength failing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. Toward the end, Dany thought she \
glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-shaped eyes, but she could not be sure. The khal\'92s face did not often betray the thoughts wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hin. \
And finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it. Only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen. \
\'93Khalakka dothrae mr\'92anha!\'94 she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. A prince rides inside me! She had practiced the phrase for days with her han
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 maid Jhiqui. \
The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised her arms on high. \'93Khalakka dothrae!\'94 she shr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 eked. The prince is riding! \
\'93He is riding!\'94 the other women answered. \'93Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!\'94 they proclaimed. A boy, a boy, a strong boy. \
Bells rang, a sudden clango
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long low note. The old
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 women began to chant. Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat. The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 oward the moon and the stars. The Dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across the sky by night. \
As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye, the better to peer into the future. The silence that fell was complete. Dany could hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, the gentle lapping of water from the lake. The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting. \
Khal Drogo laid his hand on Dany\'92s arm. She could feel the tension in his fingers. Even a khal as mighty as Drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smok
\f3 e of 
\f1 the future. At her back, her handmaids fluttered anxiousl
\f3 y. \
Finally 
\f1 the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. \'93I have seen his face, and hear
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the thunder of his hooves,\'94 she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice. \
\'93The thunder of his hooves!\'94 the others chorused. \
\'93As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies will tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their fl
\f3 esh i
\f1 n grief. The bells in his hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name.\'94 T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e old woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. \'93The prince is riding, and he \
shall be the stallion who mounts the world.\'94 \
\'93Th
\f3 e stallion who mounts the world!\'94
\f1  the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to the sound of their voices. \
The one-eyed crone peered at Dany. \'93What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts the world?\'94 \
She stood to answer. \'93He shall be called Rhaego,\'94 she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught her. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breast
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. \'93Rhaego,\'94 they screamed. \'93Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!\'94 \
The name was still ringi
\f3 ng in her
\f1  ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His bloodriders fell in behind them. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad gr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ssy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. Still, it gave Dany the shive
\f3 rs to think that one day she might
\f1  be sent to join them, whether she willed it 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r no. \
Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the khalakka Fogo, Khal Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo\'92s khalasar, Dany\'92s handmaids, the khal\'92s servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they m
\f3 arched 
\f1 along the godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he road. Alongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the flickering flame
\f3 s made the
\f1  great monuments seem almost alive. \
\'93What is meaning, name Rhaego?\'94 Khal Drogo asked as they walked, usi
\f3 ng the
\f1  Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teachin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  him a few words when she could. Drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could understand a word he said. \
\'93My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,\'94 she told him. \'93He died before I was born. Ser J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rah says that he was the last of the dragons.\'94 \
Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black mustache, drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the \
shadow of a smile. \'93Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,\'94 he said. \
They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding 
\f3 upon the
\f1  back of the first horse. \
The proce
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 sion waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 all to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall ree
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering and re-forming as her ri
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lips. The stallion\'92s blood had dried on her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the chil
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watche
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , and wondered what they were saying. \
When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried to her with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. Then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  as he might lift a child. The bells in his hair rang softly. \
Dany wrapped her arms around his s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 oulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself inside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. \'93The stallion who mounts the world,\'94 Drogo whispered hoarsely. His hands sti
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l smelled of horse blood. He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, and when he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet. \
Khal 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 rogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the lake
\f3 shor
\f1 e. Cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver. Drogo spurred his stallion, and set off d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wn the godsway beneath the moon and stars. On her silver, Dany easily kept pace. \
The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo\'92s hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon followed them inside. Flames leap
\f3 t ten 
\f1 feet in the air from three huge stone-lined firepits. The air was thick with 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he smells of roasting meat and curdled, fermented mare\'92s milk. The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered, the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  sufficient to allow them at the ceremony. As \
Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, every eye was on her. The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within her. She could not understand all they shouted, but one phrase came clear. \'93The stallion that mounts the 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 orld,\'94 she heard, bellowed in a thou
\f3 sand voi
\f1 ces. \
The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Half-clothed women spun and danced on the low tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegrana
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 es. Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare\'92s milk, yet Dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight, not here in the sacred city, where blades and bloodshed were forbidden. \
Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo, who had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 been in Vaes Dothrak 
\f3 with 
\f1 the
\f3 ir kha
\f1 lasars when they arrived, were given seats of high honor to Drogo\'92s right and 
\f3 left. The
\f1  bloodriders of the three khals sat below them, and farther down Khal Jommo\'92s four wives. \
Dany climbed 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ff her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah and Irri arranged her cushions, she searched for her b
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 other. Even across the length of the crowded ha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l, Viserys should have been conspicuous with h
\f3 is p
\f1 ale skin, silvery hair, and beggar\'92s rags, but she did not 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ee him anywhere. \
Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables, but all the faces she saw had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 black eyes and copper skin. She spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall, close to the middle firepit. It was a place of respect, if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight\'92s prowess with a sword. Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before her. \'93Khaleesi,\'94 he said, \'93I am yours to command.\'94 \
She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. \'93Sit and talk w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th me.\'94 \
\'93You honor me.\'94 The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion. A slave knelt before him, offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took one and bit it in half. \
\'93Where is my brot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er?\'94 Dany asked. \'93He ought to have come by now, for the feast.\'94 \
\'93I saw His Grace this morning,\'94 he told her. \'93He told me he was going to the Western Market, in search of wine.\'94 \
\'93Wine?\'94 Dany said doubtfully. Vis
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare\'92s milk the Dothraki drank, she knew 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat, and he was oft at the bazaars these days, \
drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from east and west. He seemed to find their company more congenial than hers. \
\'93Wine,\'94 Ser J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rah confirmed, \'93and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans.\'94 A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him, and he attacked it w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th both hands. \
\'93Is that wise?\'94 she asked. \'93He has no gold to pay soldiers. What if he\'92s 
\f3 betray
\f1 ed?\'94 Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the Usurper in King\'92s Landing would pay well for her brother\'92s head. \'93You ought to have gone with him, to keep him safe. You are his sworn sword.\'94 \
\'93We are in Vaes Dothrak,\'94 he reminded he
\f3 r. \'93No
\f1  one may carry a bl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 de here or shed a man\'92s blood.\'94 \
\'93Yet men die,\'94 she said. \'93Jhogo told me. Some of the traders have eunuchs with them, huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk. That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.\'94 \
\'93Then
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 let us hope your brother w
\f3 ill b
\f1 e wise enough not to steal anything.\'94 Ser Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table. \'93He had planned to take your dragon\'92s eggs, until I warned him that I\'92d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.\'94 \
For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. \'93My eggs . . . but they\'92re mine, Mag
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ster Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want . . . they\'92re only stones . . . \'94 \
\'93The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fi
\f3 re opals, Pri
\f1 nc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ss . . . and dragon\'92s eggs are rarer by far. Those traders he\'92s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.\'94 \
Dany had not known, had not even suspected. \'93Then . . . he should have them. He 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 oes not need to steal them. 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 e had only to ask. He is my brother . . . and my true king.\'94 \
\'93He is
\f3  your brother,\'94 Se
\f1 r Jorah acknowledged. \
\'93You do not understand, ser,\'94 she said. \'93My mother died giving me birth, and my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that. I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys had not been there to tell me. He was the only one left. The only one. He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is all I have.\'94 \
\'93Once,\'94 said Ser Jorah. \'93No longer, Khaleesi. You belong to the Do
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hraki now. In your wo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 b rides the stallion who mounts the world.\'94 He held out his cup, and a slave filled it with fermented mare\'92s milk, sour-smelling and thick with clots. \
Dany waved her away. Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and she would take 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 o chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat. \'93What does it mean?\'94 she asked. \'93What is this stallion? Everyone was shouting it at me, but I don\'92t understand.\'94 \
\'93The stallion is the khal of khals promised in anc
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ent prophecy, child. He will unite the Dothraki into a single khalasar and ride 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the ends of the earth, or so it was promised. All the people of the world will be his herd.\'94
\f3  
\f1 \
\'93Oh,\'94 Dany said in a small voice. Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach. \'93I named him Rhaego.\'94 \
\'93A name to make the Usurper\'92s blood run cold.\'94 \
Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow. \'93My lady, \'93 the handmaid whispered urgently, \'93your brother . . . \'94 \
Dany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there he was, striding toward her. From the lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his\
wine . . . and something that passed for courage. \
He was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ak and gloves were black velvet, faded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair matted and tangled
\f3 . A l
\f1 ongsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed; Dany heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her, 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ike a tide. The music died away in a nervous stammering of drums. \
A sense of dread closed around her heart. \'93Go to him,\'94 she commanded Ser Jorah. \'93Stop him. Bring him here. Tell him he can have the dragon\'92s eggs if that is what he wants.\'94 The knight rose swiftly to his fe
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t. \
\'93Where is my sister?\'94 Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. \'93I\'92ve come for her feast. How dare you presume to eat without me? No one eats before the king. Where is she? The whore can\'92t hide from the dragon.\'94 \
He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the fac
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s of the \
Dothraki. There were five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who knew the Common Tongue. Yet even if his words were incomprehensible, you had only to look at him 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o know that he was drunk. \
Ser Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered somethin
\f3 g in 
\f1 his ear, and took him by the arm, but Viserys wrenched free. \'93Keep your hands off me! 
\f2\fs24 N
\f1\fs28 o one touches the dragon without leave.\'94 \
Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals beside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly. \
The sound of laughter made Vi
\f3 serys 
\f1 lift his eyes. \'93
\f3 Khal Dro
\f1 go
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 he said thickly, his voice almost polite. \'93I\'92m here for the feast.\'94 He staggered away from Ser Jorah, making to join the three khals on the high bench. \
Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could understand, and pointed. \'93Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,\'94 Ser Jorah translated for her brother. \'93Khal Drogo says your place is there.\'94 \
Viserys glanced where the khal was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a corner by the wall, deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed. Far from the meat, and farther from honor. \'93That is no place for a king,\'94 her brother declared. \
\'93Is place,\'94 Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him, \'93f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r Sorefoot King.\'94 He clapped his hands together. \'93A cart! Bring cart fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Khal Rhaggat!\'94 \
Five thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout. Ser Jorah was standing beside Viserys, screaming i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  his ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could not hear what he was saying. Her brother shouted back and the two men grappled, until Mormont knocked Viserys bodily to the floor. \
Her brother drew his swo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d. \
The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits. \'93Keep away from me!\'94 Viserys hissed. Ser Jorah backed off a step, and her brother climbed unsteadily to his feet. He waved the sword over his head, the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had given him to make him seem more kingly. Dothrak
\f2\fs24 i
\f3\fs28  were shrieking 
\f1 at him from all sides, screaming
\f3  vile curses. \
Dany gave
\f1  a
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 wordless \cf2 cr\cf3 y of terror. She k\cf2 ne\cf3 w wha
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3  a drawn \cf2 sw\cf3 ord meant here, ev\cf2 en\cf3  if 
\f2 \cf2 \

\f0\b\fs38 her bro
\f2\b0\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her did not. \
Her voice made Viserys turn his head, and he saw her for the first time. \'93There she is,\'94 he said, smiling. He stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies, though no one tried to bar his way. \
\'93The blade . . . you must not,\'94 she begged him. \'93Please, Viserys. It is for
\f3 bidden. Put dow
\f1 n the sword and come share my cushions. There\'92s drink, food . . . is it the dragon\'92s eggs you 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ant? You can have them, only throw away the sword.\'94 \
\'93Do as she tells you, fool,\'94 Ser Jorah shouted, \'93before you get us all killed.\'94 \
Viserys laughed. \'93They can\'92t kill us. They can\'92t s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ed blood here in the sacred city . . . but I can.\'94 He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys\'92s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. \'93I want what I came for,\'94 he told her. \'93I want the crown 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e promised me. He bought you, but he never paid for you. Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I\'92m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can keep
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his bloody foal. I\'92ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.\'94 The sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her brother. \
Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading that she dared not translate,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up the Mother of Mountains. She put her arm around the girl. \'93Don\'92t be afraid,\'94 she said. \'93I shall tell him.\'94 \
She did not know if she ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  enough words, yet when she was done Khal Drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in Dothraki, and she knew he understood. The sun of her life stepped down from the high bench. \'93What did he say?\'94 the man who had been her brother asked her, flinching. \
It had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo\'92s hair, chiming softly with each step he took. His bloodriders followed him, like three copper shadows. Daenerys had gone cold all over. \'93He says you shall have a
\f3  splendid golden crown th
\f1 at men shall tremble to behold.\'94 \
Viserys smiled and lowered his sword. That was the saddest
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 thing, the thing that tore at her afterward . . . the way he smiled. \'93That was all I wanted,\'94 he said. \'93What was promised.\'94 \
When the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm aro
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nd his waist. The khal said a word, and his bloodriders le
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 pt forward. Qotho seized the man who had been her \
brother by the arms. Haggo shattered his wrist with a single, sharp twist of his huge hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from his limp fingers. Even now Viserys did not understand. \'93No,\'94 he shouted, \'93you cannot touch me, I am the dragon, the dragon, and I will be crowned!\'94 \
Khal Drogo unfastened his belt. The medallions were pure gold, massive and ornate, each one as large as a man\'92s hand. He shouted a command. Cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit, dumped the stew onto the ground, and returned the pot to the flames. Drogo tossed in the belt and watched wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hout expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape. She could see fires dancing in the onyx of his eyes. A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens, and he pulled them on, never so much as looking at the man. \
Viserys began to scream the high, wordless scream of the coward facing d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ath. He kicked and twisted, whimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the Dothraki he
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d him tight between them. Ser Jorah had made his way to Dany\'92s side. He put a hand on her shoulder. \'93Turn away, my princess, I beg you.\'94 \
\'93No.\'94 She folded her arms across the swell
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of her belly, protectively. \
At the last, Viserys looked at her. \'93Sister, please . . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Dany, tell them . . . make them . . . sweet sister . . . \'94 \
When the gold was half-melted an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  starting to run, Drogo reached into the flames, snatched out the pot. \'93Crown!\'94 he roared. \'93Here. A crown fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Cart King!\'94 And upended the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother. \
The sound Vi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 erys Targaryen made when that hid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ous iron helmet covered his face was like nothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor, slowed, stopped. Thick globs of molten gold dripped down
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 onto his chest, setting the scarlet silk to smoldering . . . yet no drop of blood was spilled. \
He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon. \

EDDARD \
He was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he he had walked a thousand times before. The Kings of Winter watched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 heads and snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb where his father slept, with Brandon and L
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 anna beside him. \'93Promise me, Ned,\'94 Lyanna\'92s statue whispered. She wore a garland of pale blu
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  roses, and her eyes wept blood. \
Eddard Sta
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 k jerked
\f3  upri
\f1 ght, his heart racing, the blankets tangled around him. The room was black as pitch, and someone was ha
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 mering on the door. \'93Lord Eddard,\'94 a voice called loudly. \
\'93A moment.\'94 Groggy and naked, he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber. When he opened the door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and Cayn with a taper in hand. Between them stood the king\'92s own steward. \
The 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 an\'92s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show. \'93My lord Hand,\'94 he intoned. \'93His Grace the King c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 mmands your presence. At once.\'94 \
So Robert had returned from his hunt. It wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  long past time. \'93I shall need a few moments to dress.\'94 Ned left the man waiting without. Cayn helped him with his clothes; white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers cut open down his plaster-sheathed leg, his badge of office, and last of all a belt of h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 avy silver links. He sheathed the Valyrian dagger at his waist. \
The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner bailey. The moon hung low over the walls, ripening toward full. On the ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds. \
The royal apartments were in Maegor\'92s Holdfast, a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes, a castle-within-a-castle. Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge, white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight. Within, Ned passed two other knights of the Kingsguard; Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps, and Ser Barristan 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 elmy waited at the door of the king\'92s bedchamber. Three men in white cloaks, he thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through him. Ser Barristan\'92s face w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s as \
pale as his armor. Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The royal steward opened the door. \'93Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King,\'94 he announced. \
\'93Bring him here,\'94 Robert\'92s voice called, strangely thick. \
Fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber, filling the room with a sullen red glare. The heat within was suffocating. Robert lay across the canopied bed. At the bed
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ide hovered Grand Maester Pycelle, while Lord Renly paced restlessly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 before the shutt
\f3 ered windows. Servants 
\f1 moved back and forth, feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine. Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her husband. Her hair was tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes. They followed Ned as Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the room. H
\f3 e seemed to move very slo
\f1 wly, as if he 
\f3 were still dreaming. \

\f1 The king still wore his boots. Ned co
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where Robert\'92s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him, A green doublet lay on the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown stains. The room smelled of smoke and bloo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and death. \
\'93Ned,\'94 the king whispered when he saw him. His face was pale as milk. \'93Come . . . closer.\'94 \
His men brought him close. Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost. He had only to look down at Robert to 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 now how bad it was. \'93What . . . ?\'94 he began, his throat clenched. \
\'93A boar.\'94 Lord Renly was s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ill in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood. \
\'93A devil,\'94 the king husked. \'93My own fault. Too much wine, damn me to hell. Missed my thrust.\'94 \
\'93And where were the rest of you?\'94 Ned demanded of Lord Renly. \'93Where was Ser Barr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 stan and the Kingsguard?\'94 \
Renly\'92s mouth twitched. \'93My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone.\'94 \
Eddard Stark lifted the blanket. \
The
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  had done what they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough. The boar must have been a fearsome thing. It had ripped the king from groin to nipple
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with \
its tu
\f3 sks. The wine-s
\f1 oaked bandages that Grand
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Maester Pycelle had applied were already black with blood, and the smell off the wound was hideous. Ned\'92s stomach turned. He let the blanket fall. \
\'93Stinks,\'94 Robert said. \'93The stink of death, don\'92t think I can\'92t smell it. Bastard did me good, eh? But 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28  . . . I paid him back in kind, Ned.\'94 The king\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  smile was as terrible as his wound, his teeth red. \'93Drove a knife right through his eye. Ask them if I didn\'92t. Ask the
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 .\'94 \
\'93Truly,\'94 Lord Renly murmured. \'93We brought the carcass back with us, at my brother\'92s command.\'94 \
\'93For
\f3  the 
\f1 feast,\'94 Ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ert whispered. \'93Now leave us. The lot of you. I need to speak with Ned.\'94 \
\'93Robert, my sweet lord . . . \'94 Cersei began. \
\'93I said leave,\'94 Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness. \'93What part of that don\'92t you understand, woman?\'94 \
Cersei gath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door. Lord Renly and the others followed. Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, his hands shaking as he offered the king a cup of thick white liquid. \'93The milk of the poppy, Your Grace,\'94 he said. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Drink. For your pain.\'94 \
Robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand. \'93Away with you. I\'92ll sleep soon enough, old fool. Get out.\'94 \
Grand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Damn you, Robert,\'94 Ned said when they were alo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e. His leg was throbbing so badly he was almost blind with pain. Or perhaps it was grief that fo
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ged his eyes. He lowered himself to the bed, beside his friend. \'93Why do you always have to be so headstrong?\'94 \
\'93Ah, fuck you, Ned,\'94 the king said hoarsely. \'93I killed the bastard, didn\'92t I?\'94 A lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned. \'93Ought to do the same for you. Can\'92t leave a man to h
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nt in peace. Ser Robar found me. Gregor\'92s head. Ugly thought. Never told the Hound. Let Cersei surprise him.\'94 His laugh turned into a grunt as a spasm of pain hit
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. \'93Gods have mercy,\'94 he muttered, swallowing his agony. \'93The girl. Daenerys. Only a child, you were right . . . that\'92s why, the girl . . . the gods sent the boar . . . sen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  to punish me . . .\'94 The king coughed, bringing up blood. \'93Wrong, it was wrong, I . . . only a girl . . . Varys, 
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 ittlefinger, even my brother . . . worthless . . . no one \
to tell me no but you, Ned . . . only you . . . \'94 He l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 fted his hand, the gesture pained and feeble. \'93Paper and ink. There, on the table. Write what I tell you.\'94 \
Ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill. \'93At your command, Your Grace.\'94 \
\'93This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and all the rest\'97put in the damn titles, you know ho
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  it goes. I do hereby command Eddard of House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King, to serv
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my . . . upon my death . . . to rule in \
my . . . in my stead, until my son Joffrey does come of age . . . \'94 \
\'93Robert . . . \'94 Joffrey is not your son, 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e wanted to say, but the words would not come. The agony was written too plainly across Robert\'92s face; he could not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hurt him more. So Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said \'93my son Joffrey,\'94 he scrawled \'93my heir\'94 instead. The deceit made him feel soiled. The lies we tell for love, he thought. May the gods forgive me. \'93What else would you have me say?\'94 \
\'93Say . . . whatever you need to. Protect and defend, gods old and new, you have the words. Write. I\'92ll sign it. You give it to the council when I\'92m dead.\'94 \
\'93Robert,\'94 Ned said in a voice thick with grief, \'93you mus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  not do this. Don\'92t die on me. The realm needs you.\'94 \
Robert took his hand, fingers squeezi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g hard. \'93You are . . . such a bad liar, Ned Stark,\'94 he said through his pain. \'93The realm . . . the realm knows . . . what a wretched king I\'92ve been. Bad as Aerys, the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ods spare me.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned told his dying friend, \'93not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Not near so bad as Aerys.\'94 \
Robert managed a weak red smile. \'93At the least, they will say . . . this last thing . . . this I did right. You won\'92t fail me. You\'92ll rule n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w. You\'92ll hate it, worse than I did . . . but you\'92ll do well. Are you done with the scribbling?\'94 \
\'93Yes, You
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Grace.\'94 Ned offered Robert the paper. The king scrawled his signature blindly, leaving a smear of blood across the lette
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . \'93The seal should be witnessed.\'94 \
\'93Serve the boar at my funeral feast,\'94 Robert rasped. \'93Ap
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 le in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the bastard. Don\'92t care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned.\'94 \
\'93I promise.\'94 Promise me, Ned, Lyanna\'92s voice echoed. \
\'93The girl,\'94 the king said. \'93Daenerys. Let her live. If you can, if it .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . not too late . . . talk to them . . . V
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rys, Littlefinger . . . don\'92t let them kill her. And help my son, Ned. Make him be . . . better than me.\'94 He winced. \'93Gods have mercy.\'94 \
\'93They will, my friend,\'94 Ned said. \'93They will.\'94 \
The king closed his eyes and seemed to relax. \'93Killed by a pig,\'94 he mutte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed. \'93Ought to laugh, but it hurts too much.\'94 \
Ned was not laughing. \'93Shall I call them back?\'94\
Robert gave a weak nod. \'93As you will. Gods, why is it so cold in here?\'94 \
The servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fires. The queen had gone; that was some small relief, at least. If she had any sense, Cersei would take her children and fly before the break of day, Ned thought. She had lingered too long already. \
King Robert did not seem to miss her. He bid h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s brother Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had dripped upon his letter. \'93Now give me something fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  the pain and let me die.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy. This time the king drank deeply. His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he thre
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  the empty cup aside. \'93Will I dream?\'94 \
Ned gave him his answer. \'93You will, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Good,\'94 he said, smiling. \'93I will give Lyanna your love, Ned. Take care of my children for me.\'94 \
The words twisted in Ned\'92s belly like a knife. For a moment he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was at a loss. He could not bring himself to lie. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at her mother\'92s breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at his forge, and all the others. \'93I shall . . . guard your children as i
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  they were my own,\'94 he said slowly. \
Robert nodded and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 c
\f3 losed hi
\f1 s eyes. Ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face. Sleep took him. \
Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned. \'93I will do all in my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified. It took them two days to get him back. \
By the time I saw him, it was too late. I can lessen His Grace\'92s suffering, but only the gods can heal him
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now.\'94 \
\'93How long?\'94 Ned asked.\
\'93By rights, he should be dead already. I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely.\'94 \
\'93My brother was always strong,\'94 Lord Renly said. \'93Not wise, perhaps, but strong.\'94 In the sweltering heat of the bedchamber, his brow was slick with sweat. He might have been Robert\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ghost as he stood there, young and dark and handsome. \'93He slew the boar. His entrails were sliding from his belly, yet somehow he slew the boar.\'94 His voice was full of wonder. \
\'93Ro
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ert was never a man to leave the battleground so
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 long as a foe remained standing,\'94 Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  told him. \
Outside the door, Ser 
\f2\fs24 B
\f1\fs28 arristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs. \'93Maester Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy,\'94 Ned told him. \'93Se
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me.\'94 \
\'93It shall be as you command, my lord.\'94 Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his ye
\f3 ars. \'93I have failed my sacred trust.\'94 \
\'93Even the tru
\f1 est knight cannot protect a king against himself,\'94 Ned said. \'93Robert loved to hunt boar. I have seen him take a thousand of them.\'94 He would stand his ground without flinching, his legs braced, the great spear in his hands, and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged, and wait until the last possible second, until it was almost on him, b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 fore he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust. \'93No one could know this one would be his death.\'94 \
\'93You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.\'94\
\'93The king himself said as much. He blamed the wine.\'94 \
The white-haired knight gave a weary nod. \'93His Grace was reeling in his s
\f3 addle by th
\f1 e time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he command
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d us all to stand aside.\'94 \
\'93I wonde
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 , Ser Barristan,\'94 asked Varys, so quietly, \'93who gave the king this wine?\'94 \
Ned had not heard the eunuch approach, but when he looked around, there he stood. H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor, and his face was freshly powdered. \
\'93The wine was from
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the king\'92s own skin,\'94 Ser Barristan said. \'93Only one skin? Hunting is such thirsty work.\'94 \
\'93I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 did not keep count. More than one, for a certainty. His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t.\'94 \
\'93Such a dutiful boy,\'94 said Varys, \'93to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment.\'94 \
Ned had a bitter taste in his mouth. He recalled the two fair-haired boys Robert had sent chasing after a breastplate stretcher. The king had told everyone the tale that night at the feast, laughing until he shook. \'93Which squire?\'94 \
\'93The elder,\'94 said Ser Ba
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ristan. \'93Lancel.\'94 \
\'93I kno
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  the lad well,\'94 said Varys. \'93A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannister\'92s son, nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen. I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself. Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth, how well do I remember.\'94 \
Certainly Varys had once been young. Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent. \'93You mention children. Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you made, I want unmade. At once.\'94 \
\'93Alas,\'94 said Varys. \'93At once may be too late. I fear those birds have flown. But I sha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l do what I can, my lord. With your leave.\'94 He bowed and vanished down the steps, his soft- soled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his descent. \
Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the brid
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 e when Lord Renly emerged from Maegor\'92s Holdfast. \'93Lord Eddard,\'94 he cal
\f3 led after Ned, \'93a moment, if you would be so
\f1  kind.\'94 \
Ne
\f3 d stopped. \'93As you wish.\'94 \
Renly walked to his side. \'93Send your men away.\'94 They met in the center of the bridge, the dry moat beneath them. Moonlight silvered the 
\f1 cruel 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 dges of the spikes that lined its bed. \
Ned gestured. Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully. Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them. \'93That letter.\'94 He leaned clo
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e. \'93Was it the regency? Has my \
brother named you Protector?\'94 He did not wait for a reply. \'93My lord, I ha
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights a
\f3 nd lords. Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.\'94 \
\'93An
\f1 d what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?\'94 \
\'93Strike! Now, while the castle sle
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ps.\'94 Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper. \'93We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand. Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the kingdom. We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well. Once we have her children, Cersei will not dare oppose us. The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and make Joffrey your ward.\'94 \
Ned regard
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d him coldly. \'93Robert is not dead yet. The gods may spare him. If not, I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.\'94 \
Lord Renly took a step back, taut as a bowstring. \'93Every momen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  time Robert dies, it may be too late . . . for both of us.\'94 \
\'93Then we should pray that Robe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 t does not die.\'94 \
\'93Small chance of that,\'94 said Renly. \
\'93Sometimes the gods are merciful.\'94 \
\'93The Lannisters are not.\'94 Lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Renly turned away and went back across the moat, to the tower where his broth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r lay dying. \
By the time Ned returned to his chambers, he felt weary and heartsick, yet there was no question of his going back to s
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eep, not now. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die, Cersei Lannister had told him in the godswood. He found himself wondering if 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly\'92s offer. He had no taste for these intrigues, and there was no honor in threatening children, and yet . . . if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee, he might well 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave need of Renly\'92s hundred swords, and more besides. \
\'93I want Littlefinger,\'94 he told C
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 yn. \'93If he\'92s not in his chambers, take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King\'92s Landing until you find him. Bring him to me 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 efore break of day.\'94 Cayn bowed and took his leave, and Ned turned to Tomard. \'93The Wind Witch sails 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n
\f3  the e
\f1 vening tide. Have you c
\f3 hosen th
\f1 e escort?\'94 \
\'93Ten men, with Porther in command.\'94 \
\'93Twen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 y, and you will command,\'94 Ned said. Porther was a brave man, but headstrong. He wanted someone more solid 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd sensible to keep watch over his daughters. \
\'93As you wi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 h, m\'92lo
\f3 rd,\'94 
\f1 Tom said. \'93Can\'92t say I\'92ll be sad to see the back of this place. I miss the wife.\'94 \
\'93You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north. I need you to deliver a letter for me.\'94 \
Tom looked apprehensive. \'93To Dragonstone, m\'92lord?\'94 The island fortress of House Targaryen had a sinister repute. \
\'93Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island. They may be wary of unexpected visitors. If he is reluctant, offer him whatever it takes. I will give you a letter to place into the hand of Lord Stannis Baratheon. No one else. Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady wife, but only Lord Stannis himself.\'94 \
\'93As you command, m\'92lord.\'94 \
When Tomard had left him, Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside him on the table. For a moment his grief overwhelmed him. He wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood, to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of Robert
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Baratheon, who had been more than a brother to him. Men would whisper afterward 
\f3 that
\f1  Eddard Stark had betrayed his king\'92s friendship and disinherited his sons; he could only hope that the gods would know better, and that Robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave. \
Ned took out the king\'92s last letter. A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden wax, a few short words and a smear of blood. How small the difference between victory and defeat, between life and death. \
He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot. To His Grace, Stannis of the House Baratheon, he wrote. By the time you receive this letter, your brother Robert, our King th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s
\f3 e p
\f1 ast fifteen year
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , will be dead. He was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood . . . \
The letters seemed to writhe an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop. Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 isgrace meekly; they would fight rather than flee. No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but it was \
imperative that he sail for King\'92s Landing at once with all his power, before the Lannisters could march. \
Ned chose each word with care. When he was done, he signed the letter Eddard Stark,
\f3  Lord of Winterfell
\f1 , Hand of the Kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 , and Protector of the Realm, blotted the paper, folded it twice, and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame. \
His regency would be a short one, he reflected as the wax softened. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he new king would choose his own Hand. Ned 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould be free to go home. The thought of Winterfell brought a wan smile to his face. He wanted to hear Bran\'92s laughte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  once more, to go hawking with Robb, to watch Rickon at play. He wanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in his own bed with his arms wrapped tight around his lady, Catelyn. \
Cayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax. Desmond was with him, and between them Littlefinger. Ned thanked his guards and sent them away. \
Lord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves, his silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds. \'93I suppose congratulations are in order,\'94 he said as he seated himself. \
Ned scowled. \'93The king l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 es wounded and near to death.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 Littlefinger said. \'93I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm.\'94 \
Ned\'92s eyes flicked to the king\'92s letter on the table beside him, its seal unbroken. \'93And how is it you know that, my lord?\'94 \
\'93Varys hinted as much,\'94 Littlefinger said, \'93and you have just confirmed it
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Ned\'92s mouth twisted in anger. \'93Damn Varys and his little birds. Catelyn spoke truly, the man has some black art. I do not trust him.\'94 \
\'93Excellent. You\'92re learning.\'94 Littlefinger leaned forward. \'93Yet I\'92ll wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 dmitted. \'93I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect. Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister\'92s bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen.\'94 \
Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. \'93Shocking,\'94 he said in a tone that suggested he was not \
shocked at all. \'93The girl as well? No doubt. So when the king dies . . . \'94\
\'93The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Rober
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s two brothers.\'94 \
Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter. \'93So it would seem. Unless . . . \'94 \
\'93Unless, my lord? There is no seeming to this. Stannis is the heir. Nothing can change that.\'94 \
\'93Stannis cannot take the throne without your help. If you\'92re wise, you\'92ll make certain Joffre
\f3 y succeed
\f1 s.\'94 \
Ned gave him a stony stare. \'93Hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  you no shred of honor?\'94 \
\'93Oh, a shred, surely,\'94 Littlefinger replied negligently. \'93Hear me out. Stanni
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  is no friend of yours, nor of mine. Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him. The man is iron, hard and unyielding. He\'92ll give us a new Hand and a new council, for a certainty. No doubt he\'92ll thank you for handing him the crown, but he won\'92t love you for it. And his ascent will mean war. Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei and her bastards are dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter\'92s head is measured for a spike? Casterly Rock will rise, and not alone. Robert fou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1 \cf3 d it in h\cf2 im\cf3  to pardon men who\cf2  s\cf3 erved
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 King Aery\cf2 s,\cf3  so long as they d\cf2 id\cf3  him 
\f2 \cf2 f
\f0\b\fs38 ealt
\f2\b0\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 . Stannis is less forgiving. He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm\'92s End, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not. Every man who fought beneath the dragon banner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear. Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I promise you, the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 realm will bl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ed. \
\'93Now look at the other side of the coin. Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the regency, my lord. You ar
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  the Hand of the King and Protector of the Re
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lm. The power is yours, Lord Stark. All you need do is reach out and take it. Make your peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed Joffrey to your Sansa. Wed your younger girl to Prince Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella. It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age. By then he wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l look to you as a second father, and if not, well . . . four years is a good long while, my lord. Long enough to dispose of Lord Stannis. Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little secret and put Lord Renly on the throne.\'94 \
\'93We?\'94 Ned repeated. \
Littlefinger gave a shrug. \'93You\'92ll need someone to share your burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.\'94 \
\'93Your price.\'94 Ned\'92s voice was ice. \'93Lord Baelish, wha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  you suggest is treason.\'94 \'93Only if we lose.\'94 \
\'93You forget,\'94 Ned told him. \'93You forget Jon Arryn. You forget Jory Cassel. And you forget this.\'94 He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them; a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as sharp as the difference between right and wrong, between true and false, between life and death. \'93They sent a man to cut my son\'92s throat, Lord Baelish.\'94 \
Li
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 tlefinger sighed. \'93I fear I did forget, my lord. Pray forgive me. For a moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark.\'94 His mouth quirked. \'93So it will be Stannis, and war?\'94 \
\'93It is not a choice. Stannis is the heir.\'94 \
\'93Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector. What would you have of me, then? Not my wisdom, for a certainty.\'94 \
\'93I shall do my best to forget your . . . wisdom,\'94 Ned said with distaste. \'93I called you here to ask for the help you promised
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Catelyn. This is a perilous hour for all of us. Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands . . . enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard. And for all I know, her brother
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Jaime may be riding for King\'92s Landing even as we speak, with a Lannister host at his back.\'94 \
\'93And you without an army.\'94 Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning it slowly
\f3  with
\f1  a finger. \'93There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters. Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, Ser Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne\
twins . . . each of them has

\f1\fs28  retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court.\'94 \
\'93Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer. It is not enough, even if I could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance. I must have the gold cloaks. The City Watch is two thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city, and th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  king\'92s peace.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?\'94 Lord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger, setting it spi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ning in place. Round and rou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d it went, wobbling as it turned. When at last it slowed to a stop, the blade pointed at Littlefi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ger. \'93Why, there\'92s your answer,\'94 he said, smiling. \'93They follow the man who pays them.\'94 He leaned back and looked Ned full in the face, h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s grey-green \
eyes bright with mockery. \'93You wear your honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. Look at y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u now. You know why you summoned me here. You know what you w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nt to ask me to do. You know it has to be done . . . but it\'92s not honorable, so the words stick in your throat.\'94 \
Ned\'92s neck was rigid with tension. For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak. \
Littlefinger laughed. \'93I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel . . . so have no f
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ar, my good lord. For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain that the City Watch is yours. Six thousand gold pieces should do it. A third for the Command
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r, a third for the officers, a third for the men. We migh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to take chances.\'94 Smiling, he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned, hilt first. \

JON \
Jon was breaking his fast on applec
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 kes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down on the bench. \'93I\'92ve been summo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed to the sept,\'94 Sam said in an excited whisper. \'93They\'92re passing me out of training. I\'92m to be made a brother with th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rest of you. Can you believe it?\'94 \
\'93No, truly?\'94 \
\'93Truly. I\'92m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds. He needs someone who can read and write letters.\'94 \
\'93You\'92ll do well at that,\'94 Jon said, smiling. \
Sam glanced about anxiously. \'93Is it time to go? I shouldn\'92t be late, they might change their minds.\'94 He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard. The day was warm and sunny. Rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine. \
Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the a
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 tar.
\f3  Pyp\'92s mou
\f1 th dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word. Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark\'92s little sept in Winterfell. For once the sept
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n seemed sober. \
The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser Alliser cold- eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings. Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord S
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 eward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark. \
Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head. \'93You came to us outlaws,\'94 he began, \'93poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves. You came
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to us children. You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor. You cam
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  to u
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  rich, and you came to us poor. Some of you bear the names of proud houses. Others have only bastards\'92 names, or no names at all. It makes no matter. All that is past now. On the Wall, we are all one house. \
\'93At evenfall, as the sun sets and 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e face the gathering night, you shall take your vows. From that moment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night\'92s Watch. Your crimes will be washed away, your debts forgiven. So too you must wash away your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike. Here you begin anew. \
\'93A man of the Night\'92s Wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this house or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman\'92s love, but for the realm, and all the people in it. A man of the Night\'92s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor. And you are the only sons we shall ever know. \
\'93You have learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say the
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , for once you have taken the black, there is no turning back. The penalty for desertion is death.\'94 The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said, \'93Are there any among you who wis
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall think the less of you.\'94 \
No one moved. \
\'93Well and good,\'94 said Mormont. \'93You may take your vows
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and the first of your order. Do any of you keep to the old gods?\'94 \
Jon stood. \'93I do, my lord.\'94 \
\'93I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your un
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 le did,\'94 Mormont said. \
\'93Yes, m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  lord,\'94 Jon said. The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks. \
He heard Grenn whispering behind 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im. \'93There\'92s no godswood here. Is there? I never saw a godswood.\'94 \
\'93You wouldn\'92t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,\'94 Pyp whispered back. \
\'93I would 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 o,\'94 Grenn insisted. \'93I\'92d see them a lo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g way off.\'94 \
Mormont himself confirmed Grenn\'92s doubts. \'93Castle Black has no need of a godswood. Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea. You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.\'94 \
\'93My lord.\'94 The voice made Jon glan
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e back in surprise. Samwell Tarly was on his feet. The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic. \'93Might I . .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . might I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?\'94 \
\'93Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?\'94 Mo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 mont asked. \
\'93No, my lord,\'94 Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice. The high officers fri
\f3 ghte
\f1 ned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him, Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all. \'93I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, a
\f3 nd a
\f1 ll the Tarlys for 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  thousand years.\'94 \
\'93Why would you forsake the god
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  of your father and your House?\'94 wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker. \
\'93The Night\'92s Watch is m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  House now,\'94 Sam said. \'93The Seven have never answered my prayers. Perhaps the old gods will.\'94 \
\'93As you wish, boy,\'94 Mormont said. Sam took his seat again, as did Jon. \'93We have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills.\'94 Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper. The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read. \'93Haider, to the builders,\'94 he be
\f3 gan. Ha
\f1 id
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r gave a stiff nod of approval. \'93Grenn, to the rangers. Albett, to the builders. Pypar, to the rangers.\'94 Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears. \'93Samwell, to the stewards.\'94 Sam sagged with relief, mopping at his brow with,a scrap of silk. \'93Matthar, to the rangers. Dareon, to the stewards. Todder, to the rangers. Jon, to the stewards.\'94 \
The stewar
\f3 ds? F
\f1 or a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard. Mormont must have read it wrong. He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake . . . and then h
\f3 e saw S
\f1 er 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 lliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew. \
The Old Bear rolled up the paper. \'93Your firsts will instruct you in your duties. May all the gods preserve you, brothers.\'94 The Lord Commander favored them with a h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lf bow, and took his leav
\f3 e. Ser
\f1  Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face. Jon ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  never seen the master-at-arms took quite so happy. \
\'93Rangers with me,\'94 Ser Jarem
\f3 y Rykker called when they were gone. Pyp w
\f1 as staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet. His ears were r
\f3 ed. Grenn, grinning broadly, did not seem to realize that anything was amiss.
\f1  Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept. \
\'93Builders,\'94 announced lante
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 n-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett trailed out after \
him. \
Jon looked around him in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon\'92s blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The septon was arranging crystals on the altar. Only Sam and Darcon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer . . . and him. \
Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together. \'93Samwell, you will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library. Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds. You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day. I trust you will take good care of him. He is very old and very precious to us. \
\'93Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord\'92s table and shared their meat and mead. We are sending you to Eastwatch. It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys co
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e trading. We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we\'92re getting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  arrive, he will keep you busy between ships.\'94 \
Marsh turned his smile on Jon. \'93Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, Jon. You\'92ll sleep in a cell beneath hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  chambers, in the Lord Commander\'92s tower.\'94 \
\'93And what will my duties be?\'94 Jon asked sharply. \'93Will I ser
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e the Lord Commander\'92s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?\'94 \
\'93Certainly.\'94 Marsh frowned at Jon\'92s tone. \'93And you will run his messages, keep a fire
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require of you.\'94 \
\'93Do you take me for a servant?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand. \'93We took you for a man of the Night
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s Watch . . . but perhaps we were wrong in that.\'94 \
It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out. Was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a gir
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  for the rest of his days? \'93May I go?\'94 he asked stiffly. \
\'93As you wish,\'94 Bowen Marsh responded. \
Dareon and Sam left with him. They descended to the yard in silence. Outside, Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers. Jon\'92s rage was such that he would have sma
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 hed it all in an instant, and the world be damned. \
\'93Jon,\'94 Samwell Tarly said excitedly. \'93Wait. Don\'92t you see what they\'92re doing?\'94 \
Jon turned on him in a fury. \'93I see Ser Alliser\'92s bloody hand, that\'92s all I see. He wanted to shame me, and he has.\'94 \
Dareon gave him a look. \'93The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord Snow.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,\'94 Jon blazed back. \'93It\'92s not fair!\'94 \
\'93Fair?\'94 Dareon sneered. \'93The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born. She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of fair?\'94 He walked off. \
\'93There is no shame in being a steward,\'94 Sam said. \
\'93Do yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man\'92s smallclothes?\'94 \
\'93The old man is Lord Commander of the Night\'92s Watch,\'94 Sam reminded him. \'93You\'92ll be w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th him day and night. Yes, you\'92ll pour his w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ne and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you\'92ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, s
\f2\fs24 q
\f1\fs28 uire for him in battle. You\'92ll be as close to him as his shadow. You\'92ll know everything, be a part of everything . . . and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself! \
\'93When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court. When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come. Later, though, he started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his audiences, so long as Dickon was there. He wanted his heir at his side, don\'92t you see? To watch and listen and learn from all he did
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  I\'92ll wager that\'92s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon. What else could it be? He wants to groom you for command!\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Jon was taken aback. It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at Winterfell. Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night\'92s Watch, they said. \'93I never asked for this,\'94 he said stubbornly. \
\'93None of us are here for asking,\'94 Sam reminded him. And
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed. \
Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had fo
\f3 und the courage to acc
\f1 ept his fate like a man. On 
\f3 the Wall, a man
\f1  gets 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nly what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive. Yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 \'92re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you. He\'92d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died. \
Jon let ou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1 \cf3  a deep s\cf2 ig\cf3 h. \'93You have the r\cf2 ig\cf3 ht of
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 it. I was\cf2  a\cf3 cting the boy.\'94 \'93T\cf2 he\cf3 n you
\f2 \cf2 \'92
\f0\b\fs38 ll stay
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and say your words with me?\'94\
\'93The old gods will be expecting us.\'94 He made himself smile. \
They set out late that afternoon. The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles. They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned. Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them. Jon could sense the 
\f2\fs24 v
\f3\fs28 ast weight pressing down on him as 
\f1 he waited behind the Lord Steward. The air was colder than a tomb,
\f3  and more still. He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light
\f1  on th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  north side of the Wall. \
Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively. \'93The\
wildlings . . . they wouldn\'92t . . . they\'92d never dare come this close to the Wall. Would they?\'94 \
\'93They never have.\'94 Jon climbed into his saddle. When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled. Ghost came lopin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  out of the tunnel. \
The Lord Steward\'92s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf. \'93Do you mean to take that beast?\'94 \
\'93Yes, my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lord,\'94 Jon said. Ghost\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 head lifted. He seemed to taste the air. In the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  vanish in the trees. \
Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often hunted with his 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ather and Jory and his brother Robb. He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man. The haunted fores
\f3 t wa
\f1 s 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 uch the same, and yet the feel of it was very different. \
Perhaps it was all in the knowing. They 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad ridden 
\f3 past 
\f1 the end of the world; somehow that changed everything. Every shadow seemed darker, every sou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d more ominous. The \
trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun. A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking bones. When the wind set the leaves to rust
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ing, it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up Jon\'92s spine. The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead. \
The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ds grew in a rough circle. Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring. Even in the wolfswood, you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of. The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath. The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward. The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby. Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle. \'93This is a sacred place, we will not defile it.\'94 \
When they 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ntered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn. No two were quite alike. \'93They\'92re watching us,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he whispered. \'93The old gods.\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 Jon knelt, and Sam 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 nelt beside him. \
They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night. \
\'93Hear my words, and bear witness to my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 vow,\'94 they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove. \'93Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall we
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night\'92s Watch, for this ni
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht and all the nights to come.\'94 \
The woods fell silent. \'93You knelt as boys,\'94 Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly. \'93Rise now as men of the Night\'92s Watch.\'94 \
Jon held out a hand to p
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ll Sam back to his feet. The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen. \'93Best we be starting back, m\'92lord,\'94 he said to Bowen Marsh. \'93Dark\'92s 
\f3 fall
\f1 ing, and there\'92s something in the smell
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 o\'92 the night that I mislike.\'94 \
And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods. White fur and red eyes, Jon realized, disquieted. Like the trees . . . \
The wolf had something in his jaws. Something black. \'93What\'92s he got the
\f2\fs24 r
\f3\fs28 e?\'94 asked \
Bowen Marsh, frowning.\
\'93To 
\f1 me, Ghost.\'94 Jon knelt. \'93Bring it here.\'94\
The direwolf trotted to him. Jon heard Samwell Tarly\'92s sharp intake of breath. \'93Gods be good,\'94 Dywen muttered. \'93That\'92s a hand.\'94 \

EDDARD \
The grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of hoofbeats awoke Eddard Stark from 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is brief, exhausted sleep. He lifted his head from the table to look down into the yard. Below, men in mail and leather and crimson cloaks were making the morning ring to the sound of swords, and riding down mock warriors stuffed w
\f2\fs24 i
\f3\fs28 th straw. Ned watched Sandor Cl
\f1 egane gallop across the hard-packed ground to drive an iron-tipped lance through a dummy\'92s head. Canvas ripped and straw exploded as Lannister guardsmen joked and cursed. \
Is this brave show for my benefit? he wondered. If so, Cersei was a greater fool than he\'92d imagined. Damn her, he thought, why is the woman not fled? I have given her chance after chance . . . \
The morning was overcast and grim. Ned broke his fast with his daughters and Septa Mordane. Sansa, still disconsolate, stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat, but Arya wolfed down everything that was set in fro
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t of her. \'93Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening,\'94 she said. \'93Can I, Father? All my things are packed.\'94 \
\'93A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change. I want you ready to leave
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 by midday, is that understood?\'94 \
\'93By midday,\'94 Arya said. \
Sansa looked up from her food. \'93If she can 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave a dancing lesson, why won\'92t you let me say farewell to Prince Joffrey?\'94 \
\'93I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,\'94 Septa Mordane o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 fered. \'93There would be no question of her missing the ship.\'94 \
\'93It would not be wise f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r you to go to Joffrey right now, Sansa. I\'92m sorry.\'94 Sansa\'92s eyes filled with tears. \'93But why?\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Sansa, your lord father knows best,\'94 Septa Mordane said. \'93You are not to question his decisions.\'94 \
\'93It\'92s not fair!\'94 Sansa pushed back from her table, knocked over her chair, and ran weeping from the solar. \
Septa Mordane rose, but Ned gestured her back to her seat. \'93Let her go, Septa. I will try to make her understand when we are all safely back in Winterfell.\'94 The septa bowed her head and sat down to finish her breakfast. \
It w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his solar. His shoulders slumped, as if the weight of the great maester\'92s chain around his neck had become too great to bear. \'93My lord,\'94 he said, \'93King Robert is gone. The gods gi
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e him rest.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned answered. \'93He hated rest. The gods give him love and laughter, and the joy of righteous battle.\'94 It was strange how empty he felt. He had been expecting the visit, and yet with those words, something died within him. He

\f1\fs28 ould have given all his titles for the freedom to weep . . . but he was Robert\'92s Hand, and the hour he dreaded had come. \'93Be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar,\'94 he told Pycelle. The Tower of the Hand was as secure as he and Tomard could make it; he could not say the same for the council chambers. \
\'93My lord?\'94 Pycelle blinked. \'93Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow, when our grief is not so fresh
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Ned was quiet but firm. \'93I fear we must convene at once.\'94 \
Pycelle bowed. \'93As the Hand commands.\'94 He called his servants and sent them running, then gratefully accepted Ned\'92s offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer. \
Ser Barristan Selmy was the first to answer the summons, immaculate in white cloak and enameled scales. \'93My lords,\'94 he said, \'93my place is beside the young king now. Pray give me leave to attend him.\'94 \
\'93Your place is here, Ser Barristan,\'94 Ned told him. \
Littlefinger came next, still garbed in the blue velvets and silver 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ockingbird cape he had worn the night previous, his boots dusty from riding. \'93My lords,\'94 he said, smiling at nothing in particular before he turned to Ned. \'93That little task you set me is accomplished, Lord Eddard.\'94 \
Varys entered in a wash of lavende
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 , pink from his bath, his plump face scrubbed and freshly powdered, his soft slippers all but soundless. \'93The little birds sing a grievous \
song today,\'94 he said as he seated himself. \'93The realm weeps. Shall we begin?\'94 \'93When Lord Renly arrives,\'94 Ned said.\
Varys gave him a sorrowful look. \'93I fear Lord Renly has left the city.\'94\
\'93Left the city?\'94 Ned had counted on Renly\'92s support. \
\'93He took his leave through a postern gate an hour be
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ore dawn, accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Varys told them. \'93When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste, no doubt bound for Storm\'92s End or Highgarden.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 So much for Renly and his hundred swords. Ned did not like the smell of that, but there was nothing to be done for it. He drew out Robert\'92s last letter. \'93The king called me to his side last night and commanded me to record his final words. Lord Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter, to be opened by the cou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 cil after his death. Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?\'94 \
The Lord Commander of the Kingsg
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ard examined the paper. \'93King Robert\'92s seal, and unbroken.\'94 He opened the letter and read. \'93Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent until the heir comes of age.\'94 \
And as it happens, he is of age, Ned reflected, but he did not give voice 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o the thought. He trusted neither Pycelle nor Varys, and Ser
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Barristan was honor-bound to protect and defend the boy he thought his new king. The old knight would not abandon Joffrey easily. The need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth, but Ned knew he must tread softly here, must keep his counsel and play the game until he was firmly established as regent. There 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould be time enough to deal with the succession when Arya and Sansa were safely back in Winterfell, and Lord Stannis had returned to King\'92s Landing with all his power. \
\'93I would ask this council to confi
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 m
\f3  me a
\f1 s Lord Protector, as Robert wished,\'94 Ned said, watching their faces, wondering what thoughts hid behind Pycelle\'92s half-closed ey
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s, Littlefinger
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s lazy half-smile, and the nervous flutter of Varys\'92s fingers. \
The door opened. Fat Tom stepped into the solar. \'93P
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rdon, my lords, the king\'92s steward insists . . . \'94 \
The royal steward entered and bowed. \'93Esteemed lords, the king demands the immediate prese
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ce of his small council in the throne room.\'94 \
Ned had expected Cersei to strike quickly; the summons came as no surprise. \'93The king \
is dead,\'94 he said, \'93but we sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll go with you nonetheless. Tom, assemble an escort, if you would.\'94 \
Littlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t
\f3 eps. Vary
\f1 s, Pycelle, and Ser Barristan followed close behind.
\f3  A double column of men-at-arms
\f1  i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  chainmail and steel helms was waiting outside the tower, eight strong. Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched them across the yard. There was no Lannister crimson to be seen, but Ned was reassured by the number of gold 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 loaks visible on the ramparts and at the gates. \
Janos Slynt met them at the door to the throne room, armored in 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rnate black-and-gold plate, with a high-crested helm under one arm. The Commander bowed stiffly. His m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n pushed open the great oaken doors, twenty feet tall and banded with bronze. \
The royal steward led them in. \'93All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm,\'94 he sang out. \
It was a long walk to the far end of the hall, where Joffrey waited atop the Iron Throne. Supported by Littlefinger, Ned Stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who called himself king. The others followed. The first time he had come this way, he had been on horseback, sword in hand, and the Targaryen dragons had watched 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rom the walls as he forced Jaime Lannister down from the throne. He wondered if Joffrey would step down quite so easily. \
Five knights o
\f3 f th
\f1 e Kingsguard\'97all but Ser Jaime and Se
\f2\fs24 r
\f1 \cf3  Barrista\cf2 n\'97\cf3 were arrayed in a \cf2 cr\cf3 escen
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3  around t\cf2 he\cf3  base of the thron\cf2 e.\cf3  They
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 were 
\f2\b0\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n full armor, enameled steel from helm to heel, long pale cloaks over 
\f3 their sh
\f1 oulders, shining 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hite shields strapped to their left arms. Cersei Lannister and her two younger children stood behind Ser Boros and Ser 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 eryn. The queen wore a gown of sea-green silk, trimmed with Myrish lace as pale as foam. On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ize of a pigeon\'92s egg, on her head a matching tiara. \
Above them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gol
\f3 d doub
\f1 let and a red satin cape. Sandor Clegane was stationed at the foot of the throne\'92s steep narrow stair. He wore mail and soot-grey 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 late and his snarling dog\'92s-head helm. \
Behind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen
\f3  waited with long
\f1 swords hanging from their belts. Crimson cloa
\f3 ks dr
\f1 ap
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms. But Littlefinger had kept his promise; all along the walls, in front of Rober
\f3 t\'92
\f1 s tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle, the gold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood stiffly t
\f3 o attention, each ma
\f1 n\'92s hand clasped aro
\f3 und the haft of an eight-foot-l
\f1 on
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  spear \
tipped in black iron. They outnumbered the Lannisters five to one. \
Ned\'92s leg was a blaze of pain by the time he stopped. He kept a hand on Littlefinger\'92s shoulder 
\f3 to he
\f1 lp support his weight. \
Joffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring lions to one side, fifty prancing st
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 gs to the other. \'93I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation,\'94 the boy proclaime
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . \'93I wish to be crowned within the fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.\'94 \
Ned produced Robert\'92s letter. \'93Lord Varys, be so kind
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as to show this to my lady of Lannister.\'94 \
T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e eunuch carried the letter to Cersei. The queen glanced at the words. \'93Protector of the Realm,\'94 she read. \'93Is this meant to be your shield, my lord? A piece of paper?\'94 She ripped the letter in half, ripped the halves in quarters, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd let the pieces flutter to the floor. \
\'93Those were the king\'92s words,\'94 Ser Barristan said, shocked. \
\'93We have a new king now,\'94 Cersei Lannister replied. \'93Lord Eddard, when last we spoke, you gave me some counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, my lord. Bend the knee and swear fealty to my son, and we shall allow you to step down as Hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call home.\'94 \
\'93Would that I could,\'94 Ned said grimly. If s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e was so determined to force the issue here and now, she left him no choice. \'93Your son has no claim to the throne he sits. Lord Stannis is Robert\'92s true heir.\'94 \
\'93Liar!\'94 Joffrey screamed, his face reddening.\
\'93Mother, what does he mean?\'94 Princess Myrcella asked the queen plaintively. \'93Isn\'92t Joff \
the king now?\'94 \
\'93You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark,\'94 said Cersei Lannister. \'93Ser Bar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 istan, seize this traitor.\'94 \
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard hesitated. In the blink of an eye he was surrounded by Stark guardsmen, bare steel in 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 heir mailed fists. \
\'93And now the treason moves 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 rom words to deeds,\'94 Cersei said. \'93Do you think Ser Barristan stands alone, my lord?\'94 With an ominous rasp of metal on metal, the Hound \
drew his longsword. The knights of the Kingsguard and twenty Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks moved to support him. \
\'93Kill him!\'94 the boy king screamed down from the Iron Throne. \'93Kill all of them, I command it!\'94 \
\'93You leave me no choice,\'94 Ned told Cersei Lannister. He called out to Janos Slynt. \'93Commander, take the q
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 een and her children into custody. Do them no har
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.\'94 \
\'93Men of the Watch!\'94 Janos Slynt shouted, donning his helm. A hundred gold cloaks leveled their spears and closed. \
\'93I want no bloodshed,\'94 Ned told t
\f3 he qu
\f1 een. \'93Tell your men to lay down
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 their swords, and no one need\'97\'94 \
With a single sharp thrust, the ne
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rest gold cloak drove his spear into Tomard\'92s back. Fat Tom\'92s blade dropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through his ribs, pierci
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g leather and mail. He was dead before his sword h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t the floor. \
Ned\'92s shout came far too late. Janos Slynt himself slashed open Varly\'92s throat. Cayn w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 irled, steel flashing, drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows; for an instant it looked as though he might cut his way free. Then the Hound was on him. Sandor Clegane\'92s first cut took off Cayn\'92s sword hand at the wrist; his second drove him to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone. \
As his men died around him, Littlefinger slid Ned\'92s dagger from its sheath and shoved it up under his ch
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n. His smile was apologetic. \'93I did warn you not to trust me, you know.\'94 \

ARYA \
High,\'94 Syrio Forel called out, slashing at her head. The stick swords clacked as Arya parr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed. \
\'93Left,\'94 he shouted, and his blade came whistling. Hers darted to meet it. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  clack made him click his
\f3  te
\f1 eth together. \
\'93Right,\'94 he said, and \'93Low,\'94 and \'93Left,\'94 and \'93Left\'94 aga
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n, faster and faster, moving forward. Arya retreated before him, checking each blow. \
\'93Lunge,\'94 he warned, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d when he thrust she sidestepped, swept his blade away, and slashed at his shoulder. She almost touched him, al
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ost, so close it made her grin. A strand of hair dangled in her eyes, limp with sweat. She pushed it aw
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y with the back of her hand. \
\'93Left,\'94 Syrio sang out. \'93Low.\'94 His sword was a blur
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and the Small Ha
\f3 ll echoed to the clack clack
\f1  clack. \'93Left. Left. High. Left. Right. Left. Low. Le
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 t!\'94 \
The wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it came from the wrong side. \'93Ow,\'94 she cried out. She would 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave a fresh bruise there by the time she went to sleep,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 somewhere out at sea. A bruise is a lesson, she told herself, and each lesson makes us better. \
Syrio stepped back. \'93You are dead no
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 .\'94\
Arya made a face. \'93You cheated,\'94 she said hotly. \'93You said left and you went right.\'94 \'93Just so. And now you are a dead girl.\'94\
\'93But you lied!\'94\
\'93My words lied. My ey
\f3 es a
\f1 nd my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seei
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g.\'94 \'93I was so,\'94 Arya said. \'93I watched you every second!
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Watching is not seeing, dead girl. The wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er dancer sees. Come, put down the sword, it is time for listening now.\'94 \
She follo
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ed him over to the wall, where he settled onto a bench. \'93Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat came to pass?\'94 \
\'93You were the finest swordsman in the city.\'94 \
\'93Just so, but why? Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the best? I will tell you now.\'94 He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid. \'93The seeing, the true seeing, that is the h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 art of it. \
\'93Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow
\f3 , to lands stra
\f1 nge and wonderful,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and when they return their captains fetch queer animal
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  to the Sealord\'92s menagerie. Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things. \
\'93On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s many had been sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was seate
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the sunrise. \'91Have you ever seen her like?\'92 he asked of me. \
\'93And to him I said, \'91Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,\'92 and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword.\'94 \
Arya screwed up her face. \'93I don\'92t understand.\'94 \
Syrio clicked his teeth toget
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er. \'93The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said \'91her,\'92 and that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?\'94 \
Arya thought about it. \'93You saw what was there.\'94 \
\'93Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en comes the thinking, afterward, \
and in that way knowing the truth.\'94 \'93Just so,\'94 said Arya, grinning. \
Syrio Forel allowed himself a smile. \'93I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand.\'94 \
\'93Yes!\'94 Arya said eagerly. \'93Wait till I show Jon\'97\'94 \
Behind her the gr
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 at wooden doors of 
\f1 the Small Hall flew open with a resounding crash. Arya whirled. \
A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him. He was in full armor, but his visor was up. Arya remembered his droopy eyes and ru
\f3 stc
\f1 olored whiskers f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om when he had come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant. The red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests. \'93Arya Stark,\'94 the knight said, \'93come with us, child.\'94 \
Arya chewed her lip uncertainly. \'93What do you want?\'94 \'93Your father wants to see you.\'94 \
Arya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held her by the arm. \'93And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 men in the place of his own? I am wondering.\'94 \
\'93Mind your place, dancing master,\'94 Ser Meryn 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. \'93This is no concern of 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ours.\'94 \
\'93My father wouldn\'92t send you,\'94 Arya said. She snatched up her stick sword. The Lannisters laughed. \
\'93Put down the stick, girl,\'94 Ser Meryn told her. \'93I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, the White Swords.\'94 \
\'93So was the Kingslayer when he killed 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he old king,\'94 Arya said. \'93I don\'92t have to go with you if I don\'92t want.\'94 \
Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience. \'93Take her,\'94 he said to his men
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  He lowered the visor of his helm. \
Three of them started forward
\f3 , chainmail clinking softly with each step. Arya was \
suddenly afraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself, to slow the racing of her heart. \
Syrio Forel stepped between them, tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot. \'93You will be stopping there. Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?\'94 \
\'93Out of the 
\f1 way, old man,\'94 one of the red cloaks said. \
Syrio\'92s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm. \'93I am Syrio Forel, and you will now be speaking to me with more respect.\'94 \
\'93Bald bastard.\'94 The man yanked free his longsword. The stick moved again, blindingly fast. Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went 
\f3 clattering to the stone f
\f1 loor. \'93My hand,\'94 the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers. \
\'93You are quick, for a dancing master,\'94 said Ser Meryn. \
\'93You are slow, for a knight,\'94 Syrio replied. \
\'93Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,\'94 the knight in the white armor commanded. \
Four Lannister guards
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 en unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken fingers, spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand. \
Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer\'92s stance, presenting only his side to the foe. \'93Arya 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hild,\'94 he called out, never looking, never taking his eyes off the Lannisters, \'93we are done with dancing for the day. Best you are going now. Run to your father.\'94 \
Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. \'93Swift as a deer,\'94 she whispered. \
\'93Just so,\'94 said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed. \
Arya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tight
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y in her hand. Watching him now, she realized that Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. The red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands. They had chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their pants, but only leather on their legs. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 ir
\f1  hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but no visor over the eyes. \
Syrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never seen a man \
move as fast. 
\f3 He checked one sword with his stick and
\f1  whirled away from a second. Off balance, the second man lurched into the first. Syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together. The third guard came leaping over them, slas
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ing at the water dancer\'92s head. Syrio du
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ked under his blade and thrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had been. \
The fallen men were getting u
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 . Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel ca
\f3 p off the other\'92s head. The 
\f1 dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man\'92s kneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a curse and charged, hacking down with both hands on his sword. Syrio rolled right, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd the butcher\'92s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled to his knees. The longsword crunched th
\f3 rough 
\f1 mail and leather and flesh. The man on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face blackening. \
Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that open
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d on the kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. \'93Bloody oafs,\'94 he swore, drawing his longsword from its scabbard. \
Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. \'93Arya child,\'94 he called out, never looking at her, \'93be gone now.\'94 \
Look with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nds sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his hand. \'93Syrio, run,\'94 she screamed. \
\'93The first sword of Braavos does not run,\'94 he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio danced away from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartb
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 at, he had bounced blows off the knight\'92s temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget. Arya stood frozen. S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Meryn advanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the next blow, spun away from the second, deflected the third. \
The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core. \
Sobbing, Arya spun and ran. \
She plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving between cooks and potboys. A baker\'92s helper stepped in front of her, holding a wooden tray. Arya bowled her over, scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor. She heard \
shouting behind her as she spun around a portly butcher who stood gaping at h
\f3 er with a cleaver in his hands. His arms were red to t
\f1 he elbow. \
All that Syrio Fo
\f3 rel

\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 t as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than swords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than swords.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Fear cuts deeper than swords. The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when she reached the turret stair. For an instant she froze. Up or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 down? Up would take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they\'92d expect her to go, for certain. Never do what they expect, Syr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 o once said. Arya went down, around and around, leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time. She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar, surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall. The only light came through narrow slanting windows high in the wall. \
The cellar was a dead end. There was no way out but the way she had come in. She dare not go back up those steps, but she couldn\'92t stay here, either. She had to find her father and tell him what had happened. Her father would protect her. \
Arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 b
\f3 egan t
\f1 o climb, leaping from cask to cask until s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three feet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out. Arya wriggled toward daylight. When her head reached ground level, she peered across t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e bailey to the Tower of the Hand. \
The stout wooden door hung splintere
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and broken, as if by axes. A dead man sprawled facedown on the steps, his cloak tangled beneath him, the back of his mailed shirt soaked red. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e corpse\'92s
\f3  clo
\f1 ak was grey wool trimmed with white satin, she saw with sudden terror. She could not tell who he wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 .
\f3  \
\'93No,\'94 s
\f1 he whispered. What was happening? Where was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her fathe
\f3 r? W
\f1 hy had the red cloaks come fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  her? She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said, the day she had found the monsters. If one Hand can die, why not a second? Arya felt tears in her eyes. She held her breath 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o listen. She heard the sounds of fighting, shouts, screams, the clang of steel on steel, comi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g through the windows of the Tower of the Hand. \
She could not go back. Her father . . . \
Arya closed her eyes. For a moment she was too frightened to move. They had killed Jory and Wyl and Heward, and that guardsman on the step, whoever he had been. They \
could kill her father too, and her if they caught he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . \'93Fear cuts deeper than swords
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid. \
She squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet. The castle seemed deserted. The Red Keep was never deserted. All the people must be hiding inside, their doors barred. A
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber, then moved away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping close to the wall as she slid from shadow to shadow. She pretended she was chasing cats . . . except she was the cat now, and if they caught her, they would kill her. \
Moving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to her back wherever possible so no one could surprise her
\f3 , Arya 
\f1 reached the stables almost without incident. A dozen g
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ld cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was ed
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ing across the inner bailey, but without knowing whose side they were on, she hunched down low in the shadows and let them pass. \
Hullen, who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  Arya could remember, was slumped on the ground by the stable door. He had been stabbed so many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers. Arya was certain he was dead, but when she crept closer, his eyes opened. \'93Arya Underfoot,\'94 he whispered. \'93You \
must . . . warn your . . . your lord father . . . \'94 Frothy red spittle bubbled from his mouth. The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more. \
Inside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of her father\'92s household guard. A wagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned near the door of the stable. The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they were attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the corpses was Desmond, who\'92d shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on his back, staring blindly at the ceiling as fl
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 es crawled across his eyes. Close to him was a dead man in the red cloak and lion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only one, though. Every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, Desmond had told her. \'93You liar!\'94 she said, kicking his body in a sudden fury. \
The anim
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ls were restless 
\f3 in 
\f1 their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood. Arya\'92s only plan 
\f2\fs24 w
\f3\fs28 as to saddle a hors
\f1 e and flee, away from the castle and the city. All she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell. She took a bridle and 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 arness off the wall. \
As she crossed i
\f2\fs24 n
\f3\fs28  back of the wago
\f1 n, a fallen chest caught her eye. It must have been knocked down in the fight or dropped as it was b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ing loaded. The wood had split,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the lid \
opening to spill the chest\'92s contents across the ground. Arya recognized silks and
\f3  sati
\f1 ns and velvets she never wore. She might need warm clothes on the kingsroad,\
though . . . and besides . . . \
Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes. She found a heavy woolen cloak, a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had embroidered for her, a silver baby bracelet she might sell. Shoving the broken lid out of the way, she groped inside the chest for Needle. She had hidden it way down at the bottom, under everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped. For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tolen it. Then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown. \
\'93There she is,\'94 a voice hissed close behind her. \
Startled, Arya whirled. A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin. His boots were covered with manure, and he had a pitchfork in one hand. \'93Who are you?\'94 she asked. \
\'93She don\'92t know me,\'94 he said, \'93but I knows her, oh, yes. The wolf girl.\'94 \
\'93Help me saddle a horse,\'94 Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping for Needle. \'93My father\'92s the Hand of the King, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 \'92ll reward you.\'94 \
\'93Father\'92s dead,\'94 the boy said. He shuffled toward her. \'93It\'92s the queen who\'92ll be rewarding me. Come here, girl.\'94 \
\'93Stay away!\'94 Her fingers closed around Needle\'92s hilt. \
\'93I says, come.\'94 He grabbed her arm, hard. \
Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of sudden terror, the only lesson
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her, the very first. \
She stuck him with the pointy end, driving the blade upward with a wild, hysterical strength. \
Needle went through his leather jerkin and the wh
\f3 ite fle
\f1 sh of his belly and came out between his shoulder blades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise, something between a gasp and a sigh. His hands closed around the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 blade. \'93Oh, gods,\'94 he moaned, as his undertunic began to redden. \'93Take it out.\'94 \
When she took it out, he died. \
The horses were screaming. Arya stood over the body, still and frightened in the face of death. Blood had gushed from the boy\'92s mouth as he collapsed, and more was seeping from the slit in his belly, pooling beneath his body. His palms were cut where he\'92d grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, Needle red in her hand. She had to get away, someplace far from here, someplace safe away from the stableboy\'92s 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ccusing eyes. \
She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she lifted the saddle to the horse\'92s back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed. Even the postern doors would likely be guarded. Maybe the guards wouldn\'92t recognize her. If they thought she was a boy, perhaps they\'92d let her . . . no, they\'92d have orders not 
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 o let anyone out, it wouldn\'92
\f1 t matter whether they knew her or not. \
But there was another way out of the castle . . . \
The saddle slipped from Arya\'92s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust. Could she find the room with the monsters again? She wasn\'92t certain, yet she knew she had to try. \
She found the clothing she\'92d gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing Needle beneath its folds. The rest of her things she tied in a roll. With the bundle under her arm, she crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, she 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 eeked out anxiously. She could hear the distant sound of swordplay, and the shivery wail of a man screaming in pain across the bailey. She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how she\'92d gone last time, chasing the black tomcat . . . only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn\'92t go that way. Arya tried to think of another way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 iver wall and through the little godswood . . . but first she\'92d have to cross the yard, in the plain view of the guards on the walls. \
She had never seen so many men on the walls. Gold cloaks, most of them, armed with spears. Some of them knew her by sight. Wha
\f3 t woul
\f1 d they do if they saw her running across the yard? She\'92d look so small from up there, would they be able to tell who she was? Would 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hey care? \
She had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too frightened to move. \
Calm as still water, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but \
her, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the horses, and the dead men. \
Quiet as a shadow, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio\'92s
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1 \cf3  She coul\cf2 d \cf3 not tell, yet some\cf2 ho\cf3 w it 
\f2 \cf2 c
\f1 \cf3 almed her\cf2  f\cf3 ears. \
She steppe\cf2 d \cf3 out o
\f2 \cf2 f
\f1\fs28  the stable. \
It was the scariest thi
\f2\fs24 n
\f0\b\fs38 g she\'92
\f2\b0\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  ever done. She wanted to run and hide, but she made herself walk across the yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone. She thought she could feel their eyes, like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes. Arya never looked up. If she saw them watching, all her courage would desert her, sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  knew, and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and then they would have her. She kept her gaze on the ground. By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the yard, Arya was cold with sweat, but no one had raised the hue and cry. \
The sept was open a
\f3 nd em
\f1 pt
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 . Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence. Arya figured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up her sleeves, and left by a back window. Sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one- eared tom was easy, but after that she got lost. She crawled in and out of windows, hopped over walls, and felt her way through dark cellars, quiet as a shadow. Once she heard a woman weeping. It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited. \
She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle. That was chancy;
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the fire she\'92d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals. Cupping her fingers around the flickering candle, she went out the window as they were coming in the door, without ever getting a glimpse of who it was. \
This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost o
\f3 ld friends. Arya held th
\f1 e candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her pass. \'93Dragons,\'94 she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand. \
The long windowless hall beyond the door was as black a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  she remembered. She held Needle in her left hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down across her knuckles. The entrance to the well had been to the left, so Arya went right. Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of snu
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 fing out her candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light, but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be so easy to hide here, as she had \
hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the stableboy s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 anding against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where Needle had cut him. He might be waiting to grab her as she passed. He would see her candle coming a long way off. Maybe she would be better off without the light . . . \
Fear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She\'92d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother R
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 bb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who\'92d been no bigger than Rickon was now. They\'92d only had one candle between them, and Bran\'92s eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their feet and thei
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  iron swords across their laps. \
Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. \'93There are worse things 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 han spiders and rats,\'94 he whispered. \'93This is where the dead walk.\'94 That was whe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\'92s hand. \
When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\'92s leg, sob
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. \'93You stupid,\'94 she told him, \'93you scared the baby,\'94 but Jon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ere laughing too. \
The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy was dead, she\'92d killed him, and if he jumped out at her she\'92d kill him again. She was going home. Everythin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell\'92s grey granite walls. \
Her footsteps sent soft ech
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 es hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness. \

They came for Sansa on the third day. \
SANSA \
She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her crying, and she could not seem to s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 op sobbing about her father. \
\'93I\'92m certain your father is well,\'94 Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. \'93I\'92ll ask the queen to let you see him.\'94 She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne\'92s spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a child. \
Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor\'92s Holdfast, with her do
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it as she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curse
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy. \
So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised and s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 aking. \'93They\'92re killing everyone,\'94 the steward\'92s daughter had shrieked at her. She went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, cradled in each other\'92s arms like sisters. \
The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the highest tower of Maegor\'92s Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the \
deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the Re
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole\'92s endless whimpers and sobs. \
They were fed\'97hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and greens at midday,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and a late supper of beef and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 barley stew\'97but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa\'92s questions. That evening, 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ome women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and some of Jeyne\'92s things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door stil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  refused to let them leave the room. \
\'93Plea
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e, I need to speak to the queen again,\'94 Sansa told them, as she told everyone she saw that day. \'93She\'92ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I want to see her
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  please. If not the queen, then Prince Joffrey, if you\'92d be so kind. We\'92re to marry when we\'92re older.\'94 \
At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ri
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g. Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\'92s Hill. The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, warning of the storm to come. \
\'93What is it?\'94 Jeyne asked, covering her ears. \'93Why are they ringing the bells?\'94 \
\'93The king is dead.\'94 Sansa 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ould not say how she knew it, yet she did. The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the castle and 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 urdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard? \
She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now? Or had they killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they would tell her what was happening . . . \
That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven gold. She had a crown on her head, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd everyone she had ever known came before her, to bend the knee and say their courtesies. \
The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her to the queen. \
Ser Boros was an ugly man 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ith a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, \
his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. \'93You look very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros,\'94 Sansa told him. A lady remembered her courtesies, and she was resolv
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d to be a lady no matter what. \
\'93And you, my lady,\'94 Ser Boros said in a flat voice. \'93Her Grace awaits. Come with me.\'94 \
There were guards outsid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  her 
\f3 doo
\f1 r, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion- crested helms. Sansa made herself smile at the
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past. \'93To keep you safe, my sweet one,\'94 Queen Cersei ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  told her. \'93Joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious.\'94 \
Sansa had expecte
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out of Maegor\'92s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She averted her eyes 
\f2\fs24 q
\f1\fs28 uickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long
\f3 , afraid 
\f1 he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 might be someone she knew. \
They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat sat beside the door. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, \'93I\'92ve brought the girl.\'94 \
Sansa had 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 oped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king\'92s councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen\'92s left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of dread. Mourning clothes . . . \
The quee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  wore a
\f3  high
\f1 -collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen. \'93Sansa, my sweet child,\'94 she said, \'93I know you\'92ve bee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  asking for me. I\'92m sorry that I could not send for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my people have been taking good care of you?\'94 \
\'93Ever
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 one 
\f3 has 
\f1 been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking,\'94 Sansa said politely. \'93Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what\'92s happened . . . \'94 \
\'93Us?\'94 Cersei seemed puzzled. \
\'93We put the steward\'92s girl in with her,\'94 Ser Boros said. \'93We did not know what else to do with her.\'94 \
The queen frowned. \'93Next time, you will ask,\'94 she said, her voice sharp. \'93The gods only know what sort of tales she\'92s been filling Sansa\'92s head with.\'94 \
\'93Jeyne\'92s scared,\'94 Sansa said. \'93She won\'92t stop crying. I promised her I\'92d ask if she could see her father.\'94 \

\f3 Old Gran
\f1 d Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes. \
\'93Her father is well, isn\'92t he?\'94 Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been fighting, but surely no one would harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword. \
Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn. \'93I won\'92t have Sansa fretting needlessly. What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?\'94 \
Lord Petyr leaned forward. \'93I\'92ll find a place for her.\'94 \'93Not in the city,\'94 said the queen.\
\'93Do you take me for a fool?\'94 \
The queen ignored that. \'93Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr\'92s apartmen
\f3 ts an
\f1 d instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her father, that ought to calm her down. I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chambe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 .\'94 \
\'93As you command, Your Grace,\'94 Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and took his leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him. \
Sansa was confused. \'93I don\'92t understand,\'94 she said. \'93Where is Jeyne\'92s father
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  Why can\'92t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?\'94 She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but al
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  
\f3 of
\f1  a sudden she was scared again. For a second she thought she might \
cry. \'93Where are you send
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng her? She hasn\'92t done anything wrong, she\'92s a good girl.\'94 \
\'93She\'92s upset you,\'94 the queen said gently. \'93We ca
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 \'92t be having that. Not another word, now. Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne\'92s well taken care of, I promise you.\'94 She patted the chair beside her. \'93Sit down, Sansa
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  I want to talk to you.\'94 \
Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man looked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin. \
\'93Sweet Sansa,\'94 Queen Cersei sai
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , laying a soft hand on her wrist. \'93Such a beautiful child. I do hope you know
\f3  how
\f1  much Joffrey and I love you.\'94 \
\'93You do?\'94 Sansa said, breathless. Littlefinger was forgot
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 en. Her prince loved her. Nothing else mattered. \
The queen smiled. \'93I think of you almost as my own daughter. And I know the love you bear for Joffrey.\'94 She gave a weary shake of her head. \'93I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father. You must be brave, child.\'94 \
Her qui
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t words gave Sansa a chill. \'93What is it?\'94 \'93Your father is a traitor, dear,\'94 Lord Varys said. \
Grand Maester Pycelle
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lifted his ancient head. \'93With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld protect the young princes as if they were his own sons. And yet the moment t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e king was dead, he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey\'92s rightful throne.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Sansa blurt
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. \'93He wouldn\'92t do that. He wouldn\'92t!\'94 \
The queen picked up a letter. The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, but the broken seal was her father\'92s, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. \'93We found this on the captain o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  your household guard, Sansa. It is a letter to my late husband\'92s brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.\'94 \
\'93Please, Your Grace, there\'92s been a mistake.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint. \'93Please, send for my father, he\'92ll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend.\'94 \
\'93Robert thought so,\'94 said the que
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n. \'93Th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s betrayal would have broken his heart. The gods are kind, that he did not live to see it.\'94 She sighed. \'93Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 his has left us in. You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How can I allow you to marry my so
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 \
\'93But I love him,\'94 Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean to do to her? What had they done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this way. She had to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, he was promised to her, she had even dreamed about it. It wasn\'92t fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done. \
\'93How well I know that, child,\'94 Cersei said, her voice so kind and sweet. \'93Why else should you have come to me and told me of your father\'92s plan to 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 end yo
\f3 u away from u
\f1 s, if not for love?\'94 \
\'93It was for love,\'94 Sansa said in a rush. \'93Father wouldn\'92t even give me leave to say farewell.\'94 She was the good girl
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  the obedient girl, but she ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  felt as wicked as Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying her lord father. She had never done anything so willful before, and she would never have done it then if sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  hadn\'92t loved Joffrey as much as she did. \'93He was going to take me back to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even thoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  it was Joff I wanted. I told him, but he wouldn\'92t listen.\'94 The king had been her last hope. The king could command Father to let her stay in King\'92s Landing and marry Prince Jo
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 frey
\f3 , Sans
\f1 a knew he could, but the king had always frightened her. He was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and he would probably have just sent her back to Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So she went to the qu
\f3 een 
\f1 instead, and poured out her heart, and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly . . . only then 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor\'92s Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. \'93Please,\'94 she finished, \'93you have to let me marry Joffrey, I\'92ll be ever so good a wife to him, you\'92ll see. I\'92ll be a queen just like you, I promise.\'94 \
Queen C
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rsei looked to the others. \'93My lords of the council, what do you say to her plea?\'94 \
\'93The poor child,\'94 
\f3 murmured
\f1  Varys. \'93A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be cruel to deny it . . . and yet, what can we do? Her father stands condemned.\'94 His soft hands wash
\f3 ed e
\f1 ach 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ther in a gesture of helpless distress. \
\'93A child bor
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  of traitor\'92s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,\'94 said Grand Maester Pycelle. \'93She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons she may hatch?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Sansa said, horrified. \'93I\'92
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  not, I\'92d never . . . I wouldn\'92t betray Joffrey, I love him, I \
swear it, I do.\'94\
\'93Oh, so poignant,\'94 said Varys. \'93And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.\'94 \
\'93She reminds me of the mother, not the father,\'94 Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly. \'93Look at her. The hair, the eyes. She is the very image of Cat at the same age.\'94 \
The queen looked at her, troubled, and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes. \'93Child,\'94 she said, \'93if I could truly believe th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey. I know he loves you with all his heart.\'94 She sighed. \'93And yet, I fear that Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it. The blood will tell. I have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not like Arya,\'94 Sansa blurted. \'93She has the traitor\'92s blood, not me. I\'92m good, ask Septa Mordane, she\'92ll tell you, I only want to be Joffrey\'92s loyal and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 loving wife.\'94 \
She felt the weight of Cersei\'92s eyes as the queen studied her face. \'93I believe you mean it, child.\'94 She turned to fa
\f2\fs24 c
\f1 \cf3 e the oth\cf2 er\cf3 s. \'93My lords, it s\cf2 ee\cf3 ms to
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 me that i\cf2 f \cf3 the rest of her ki\cf2 n \cf3 were 
\f2 \cf2 t
\f0\b\fs38 o re
\f2\b0\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest.\'94 \
Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard, his wide brow furrowed in thought. \'93Lord Eddard has three sons.\'94 \
\'93Mere boys,\'94 Lord Petyr said with a
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 shrug. \'93I shou
\f1 ld be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the Tullys.\'94 \
The queen took
\f3  Sansa\'92s hand in both of hers. \'93Child, do you know your letters?\'94 \
Sansa no
\f1 dded n
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rvously. She could read and write better than any of her brothers, although she was hopeless at sums. \
\'93I am pleased to hear that. Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still . . . \'94\
\'93What do you want me to do?\'94\
\'93You must write your lady
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mother, and your brother, the eldest . . . what is his name?\'94 \'93Robb,\'94 Sansa said. \
\'93The word of your lord father\'92s treason will no doubt reach them soon. Better that it should come from you. You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king.\'94 \
Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately, but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking. \'93But he never . . . I don\'92t . . . Your Grace, I wouldn\'92t know what to say \
... \'94 \
The queen patted her h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd. \'93We will tell you what to write, child. The important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king\'92s peace.\'94 \
\'93It will go hard for them if they don\'92t,\'94 said Grand Maester Pycelle. \'93By the love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.\'94 \
\'93Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,\'94 the queen said. \'93Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 u must tell her t
\f1 hat you are well and
\f3  in our care, that we are
\f1  treating you gently and seeing to y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ur every want. Bid them to come to King\'92s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne. If they do that . . . why, then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood, and when you come into the flower of your womanhood, you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men.\'94 \
. . . wed the king . . . The words made her breath come faster, yet still Sansa hesitated. \'93Perhaps . . . if I might see my father, talk to him about . . . \'94 \
\'93Treason?\'94 Lord Varys hinted. \
\'93You disappoint me, Sansa,\'94 the queen said, with eyes gone hard as stones. \'93We\'92ve told you of your father\'92s crimes. If you are truly as loyal as you 
\f3 say, why shoul
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  you want to see him?\'94 \
\'93I . . . I only meant . . . \'94 Sansa felt he
\f1 r 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 yes grow wet. \'93He\'92s not . . . please, he hasn\'92t been . . . hurt, or . . . or . . . \'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard has not been harmed,\'94 the queen said.\
\'93But . . . what\'92s to become of him?\'94\
\'93That is a matter for the king to decide,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously. \
The ki
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g! Sansa blinked back her tears. Joffrey was the king now, she thought. Her gallant prince would never hurt her father, no matter what he might have done. If she went to him 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd pleaded for mercy, she was certain he\'92
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  listen. He had to listen, he loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the lords would \
expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winter
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ell, or exile him to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a few years. By then she and Joffrey would be married. Once she was que
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n, she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant him a pardon. \
Only . . . if Mother or Robb did anything treasonou
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , called the banners or refused to swear fealty 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r anything, it would all go wrong. Her Joffrey was good and kind, she knew it in her heart, but a king had to be stern with rebels. She had to make them understand, she had to! \
\'93I\'92ll . . . I\'92ll write the letters,\'94 Sansa told them. \
Wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h a smile as warm as 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he sunrise, Cersei Lannister 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eaned close an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  kissed her gently on the cheek. \'93I knew you would. Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage and good sense you\'92ve shown here today.\'94 \
In the end, sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  wrote four letters. To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and to her brothers at Winterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa Arryn of the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. By the time she had done, her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink. Varys had her f
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ther\'92s seal. She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle, poured it carefully, and watched as the eunuch 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark. \
Jeyne Poole and all her things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned Sansa to the high tower of Maegor\'92s Holdfast. No more weeping, she thought gratefully. Yet somehow it seemed colder with Jeyne gone, even after she\'92d built a fire. She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of her favorite books, and lost herself in the stories of Florian and J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of valiant Prince Aemon and his doomed l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ve for his brother\'92s queen. \
It was not until later that night, as she was drifting off to sleep, that Sansa realized she had forgotten to ask about her sister. \

JON \
Othor,\'94 announced Ser Jaremy Rykker, \'93beyond a doubt. And this one was Jafer Flowers.\'94 He turned the corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes. \'93They were Ben Stark\'92s men, both of them.\'94 \
My uncle\'92s men, Jon thought numbly. He remembered how he\'92d pleaded to ride with them. Gods, I was such a green boy. If he had taken
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me, it might be me lying here . . . \
Jafer\'92s rig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost\'92s jaws. His right ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d was floating in a j
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r of vinegar back in Maester Aemon\'92s tower. His left hand, still at the end of his arm, w
\f3 as as black as his cloak. \
\'93Gods have mercy,\'94 the Old Bear muttered. He swung down from his garron, handing his reins to 
\f1 Jon. The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander\'92s broad forehead like dew on a melon. His horse was nervous, rolling her eyes, backing away from t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e dead men as far as her lead would allow. Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting. The horses did not like the feel of this place. For that matter, neither did Jon. \
The dogs liked it least of all. Ghost had led 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he party here; the pack of hounds had been useless. 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 hen Bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, yowling and barking, fighting to get away. Even n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling at their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs. \
It is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they\'92re only dead men. He had seen dead men before . . . \
Last night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for his father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 n
\f3  t
\f1 he dark he\'92d heard the scra
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 e of stone on stone. When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after the other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitch-dark, hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ke his deep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, restless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 It was only a \
dream. I am a brother of the Night\'92s Watch now, not a frightened boy. \
Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, ha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f-hidden behind the horses. His round fat face was the color of curdled milk. So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 uch as glanced at the dead men either. \'93I can\'92t look,\'94 he whispered miserably. \
\'93You have to look,\'94 Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear. \'93Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn\'92t he? What good are eyes if they\'92re shut?\'94 \
\'93Yes, but . . . I\'92m such a coward, Jon.\'94 \
Jon put a hand on Sam\'92s shoulder. \'93We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost. No one will hurt you, Sam. Go ahead and look. The first look is the hardest.\'94 \
Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort. Slowly he swiveled his head. His eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away. \
\'93Ser Jaremy,\'94 the Old Bear asked gruffly, \'93Ben St
\f3 ark had
\f1  six men with him when he rod
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  from the Wall. Where are the others?\'94 \
Ser Jaremy shook his head. \'93Would that I knew.\'94 \
Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer. \'93Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing. Is this what the Night\'92s 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 atch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these woods?\'94 \
\'93Yes, my lord, but\'97\'94 \
\'93Do we still mount watches?\'94 \
\'93We do, but\'97\'94 \
\'93This man wears a hunting horn.\'94 Mormont po
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nted at Othor. \'93Must I suppose that he died without sounding it?
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?\'94 \
Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger. \'93No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have heard it. I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like . . . and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 before, by your own command.\'94 \
The Old Bear grunted. \'93Yes. Well. Be that as it may.\'94 He made an imp
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 tient gesture. \'93Tell me how they died.\'94 \
Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp. The hair came out between 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is fingers, brittle as straw. The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand. A great gash in the side of the corpse\'92s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood. Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck. \'93This was done with an axe.\'94 \
\'93Aye,\'94 muttered Dywen, the old forester. \'93Belike the axe that Othor carr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed, m\'92lord.\'94 \
Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a big ugly corpse. No axe was in evidence. Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers ro
\f3 de out.
\f1  His singing days were done. His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut his hands. His hands were black like Jafer\'92s. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. Yet his eyes were still open. They stared up at the sky, blue as sapphires. \
Ser Jaremy stood. \'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e wildlings have axes too.\'94 \
Mormont rounded on him. \'93So you believe this is Mance Rayder\'92s work
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  This close to the Wall?\'94 \
\'93Who else, my lord?\'94 \
Jon could have told him. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the words. The Others are only 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  
\f3 story, a 
\f1 tale to make children shiver. If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years. Even the thought m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 de him feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night\'92s Watch, not the boy who\'92d once sat at Old Nan\'92s feet with Bran a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d Robb and Arya. \
Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort. \'93If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day\'92s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads.\'94 \
\'93Unless he was slain as well,\'94 Ser Jaremy insisted. \
The words hurt, even now. It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn. \
\'93It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Ser Jaremy went on. \'93The forest is vast. The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I\'92d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us . . . but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall. The corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day . . . .\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Samwell Tarly squeaked. \
Jon was startled. Sam\'92s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear. The fat boy was frightened 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for his p
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 tience. \
\'93I did not ask for your views, boy,\'94 Rykker said coldly. \'93Let him speak, ser,\'94 Jon blurted. \
Mormont\'92s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again. \'93If the lad has something to say, I\'92ll hear him out. Come closer, boy. We can\'92t see you behind those horses.\'94 \
Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely. \'93My lord, it . . . it can\'92t be a day or . . . look . . . the blood . . . \'94 \
\'93Yes?\'94 Mormont growled impatien
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ly. \'93Blood, what of it?\'94\
\'93He so
\f3 ils his small
\f1 clothes at the sight of it,\'94 Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed. \
Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow. \'93You . . . you can see where Ghost . . . Jon\'92s direwolf . . . you can see where he tore off that man\'92s hand, and yet . . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  the stump hasn\'92t bled, look . . . \'94 He waved a hand. \'93My father . . . L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when . . . after . . . \'94 Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering. Now that he had looked at the bodies, he could not seem to look away. \'93A fresh kill . . . the b
\f3 lood would still f
\f1 low, my lords. L
\f3 ater . . . later it would be clotted, li
\f1 ke a . . . a jelly, thick and . . . and . . . \'94 He look
\f3 ed as though he was going to be sick. \'93This man . . . look at the wrist, it\'92s all . . . crusty . . . dry . . . like . . . \'94 \
Jon saw at once what Sam meant. He could see the torn veins in the dead man\'92s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh. His blood was a black dust. Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced. \'93If they\'92d been dead mu
\f1 ch lon
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 er than a day, they\'92d be ripe by now, boy. They don\'92t even smell.\'94 \
Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow coming on, sidled cl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ser to the corpses and took a whiff. \'93Wel
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 , they\'92re no pansy flowers, \
but . . . m\'92lord has the truth of it. There\'92s no corpse stink.\'94 \
\'93They . . . they aren\'92t rotting.\'94 Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little. \'93Look, there\'92s . . . there\'92s no maggots or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . . or . . . worms or anything . . . they\'92ve been lying here in the woods, but they . . . they haven\'92t been chewed 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r eaten by animals . . . only\
Ghost . . . otherwise they\'92re . . . they\'92re . . . \'94 \
\'93Untouched,\'94 Jon said softly. \'93And Ghost is different. The dogs and the horses won\'92t go near them.\'94 \
The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them. Mormont frowned, glancing from the corpses to the dogs. \'93Chett, bring the hounds closer.\'94 \
Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 a lick of his boot. Most of the dogs just wh
\f1 im
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ered and planted their feet. He tried dragging one. The bitch resisted, growling and sq
\f2\fs24 u
\f3\fs28 irming as if to escape her collar. Finally she lunged at him. Chett dropped the leash and s
\f1 tu
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 bled backward. The dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees. \
\'93This . . . this is all wrong,\'94 Sam Tarly said earnestly. \'93The blood . . . there\'92s bloodstains on their clothes, and . . . and their flesh, dry and hard, but . . . there\'92s none
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 on the ground, or . . . anywhere. With th
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 se . . . those . . . those . . . \'94 Sam made himself swallow, took a deep breath. \'93With those wounds . . . terrib
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e wounds . . . there should be blood all over. Shouldn\'92t there?\'94 \
Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth. \'93Might be they didn\'92t die here. Might be someone brought 
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 em and left \'92em for us. A warning, as like.\'94 The old forester peered down suspiciously. \'93And might be I\'92m a fool, but I don\'92t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.\'94 \
Ser Jaremy looked startled. \'93Neither did Flowers,\'94 he blurted, turning to stare at the dead man. \
A silence fell over the wood. For a moment all th
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 y heard was Sam\'92s
\f1  heavy breathin
\f3 g and the wet sound of
\f1  D
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 wen sucking on his teeth. Jon squatted beside Ghost. \
\'93Burn them,\'94 someone whispered. One of the rangers; Jon could not have said who. \'93Yes, burn them,\'94 a second voice 
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rged. \
The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head. \'93Not yet. I want Maester Aemon to have a look at them. We\'92ll bring them back to the Wall.\'94 \
Some commands are more easily given than obeyed. They wrapped the dead men in cloak
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 , but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help. The rangers had no better luck with the o
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her garrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens. In the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rry the corpses back on foot. It was well past midday by the time they started back. \
\'93I will have these woods searched,\'94 Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out. \'93Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here. Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters fro
\f3 m the stewards. If Ben and the
\f1  others are out
\f3  here, dead or alive, I will have them found. And if there is anyone else in these woods, I will 
\f1 kn
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w of it. You are to track them and take them, alive if possib
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e. Is that understood?\'94 \
\'93It is, my lord,\'94 Ser Jaremy said. \'93It will be done.\'94 \
After that, Mormont rode in silence,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brooding. Jon followed close behind him; as t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Lord Commander\'92s steward, that was his place. The day was grey, damp, overcast, the sort of day th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t made you wish for rain. No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy, and Jon\'92s clothes clung to his skin. It was warm. Too warm. The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and sometimes Jon eve
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  imagined it was shrinking. \
The old men called this weather spirit summer, and said it meant
\f3  the season was giving up its ghosts at last. Aft
\f1 er this the cold wo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld come, they warned, and a long summer always meant a long w
\f3 inter
\f1 . This summer had last
\f3 ed ten years. Jon
\f1  h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d been a babe in arms when it began. \
Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees. Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked. He found him
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 elf glancing at every s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 adow with unease. Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He could almost hear her voice again, and the click-click-click of her needles. In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping her voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and every living creature with hot blood in its ve
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ns. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human\
children . . . \
When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved. Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his \
saddle. \'93Tarly,\'94 he barked, \'93come here.\'94 \
Jon saw the start of fright on Sam\'92s face as he lum
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ered up on his mare; doubtless he thought he was in trouble. \'93You\'92re fat but you\'92re not stupid, boy,\'94 the O
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d Bear said gruffly. \'93You did well back 
\f3 the
\f1 re. And you, Snow.\'94 \
Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own to
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 gue as he tried to stammer out a 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ourtesy. Jon had to smile. \
When they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot. Ghost came streaking out f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om the woods to meet them, licking his chops, his muzzle red from prey. High above, the men on the Wall saw the column approaching. Jon heard the deep, throat
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  call of the
\f3  wa
\f1 tchman\'92s great horn, calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice. \
UUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOO
\f2\fs24 O
\f3\fs28 ooooooooooooooooooooo
\f1 oo. \
The sound faded slowly to silenc
\f3 e. One blast meant rangers returning, and Jon thought, \
I was a ranger for one day, at le
\f1 as
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 . Whatever may come, they cannot take that away from me.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel. The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated. \'93My lord,\'94 he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars, \'93there\'92s been a bird, you must come at once.\'94 \
\'93What is it, man?\'94 Mormont said gruffly. \
Curiously, Marsh glanced at Jon b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 fore he answered. \'93Maester Aemon has the letter. He\'92s waiting in your solar.\'94 \
\'93Very well. Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put
\f3  the
\f1  dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them.\'94 Mormont strode away grumbling. \
As they led their horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were wa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ching him. Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard, but he broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile on his lips. One-armed Donal Noye stood in the door of the armory. \'93The gods be with you, Snow,\'94 he called out. \
Something\'92s 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 rong, Jon thought. Something\'92s very wrong. \
The dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the Wall, a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even \
beer. Jon saw tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  Mormont\'92s horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own. Afterward he sought out his friends. Grenn and Toad were on watch, but he found Pyp in the common hall. \'93What\'92s happened?\'94 he asked. \
Pyp lowered his voice. \'93The king\'92s dead.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Jon was stunned. Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he\'92d seemed hale enough, and there\'92d been no talk of illness. \'93How can you know?\'94 \
\'93One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon.\'94 Pyp leaned close. \'93Jon, I\'92m sorry. He was your father\'92s friend, wasn\'92t he?\'94 \
\'93They were as close as brothers, once.\'94 Jon wondered if Joffrey woul
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  keep his fath
\f1 er as the King\'92s Hand. It did not seem likely. That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well. He migh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont\'92s permission. It would be good to see Arya\'92s grin again and to talk with his father. I
\f3  will
\f1  ask him about my mother, he resolved. I am a man now, it is past time he told me. Even if she was a whore, I don\'92t care, I want to know. \
\'93I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle\'92s,\'94 Pyp said. \
\'93Yes,\'94 Jon replied. \'93Two of the six he took with him. They\'92d
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 been dead a long time, only . . . the bodies are queer.\'94 \
\'93Queer?\'94 Pyp was all curiosity. \'93How queer?\'94 \
\'93Sam will
\f3  tell you.\'94 Jon did not want to talk of it. \'93I should see if the 
\f2\fs24 O
\f1\fs28 ld Bear has need of me.\'94 \
He walked to the Lord Commander\'92s Tower alone, with a curious 
\f2\fs24 s
\f3\fs28 ense of a
\f1 pprehension. The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached. \'93The Old Bear\'92s in his solar,\'94 one of them announced. \'93He was asking for you.\'94 \
Jon nodded. He should have come straight from the stable. He climbed the tower steps br
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 skly. He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that\'92s all, he told himself. \
When he entered the solar, Mormont\'92s raven screamed at him. \'93Corn!\'94 the bird shrieked. \'93Corn! Corn! Corn!\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t you believe it, I just fe
\f3 d him,\'94 the Old Bear growled. He was
\f1  seated by the
\f3  window, reading a letter. \'93Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.\'94 \
\'93For myself,
\f1  m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  lord?\'94 \
Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon. There was pity in that look; he could taste it. \'93You heard me.\'94 \
Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act. When the cups were filled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter. Yet all too soon, they were filled. \'93Sit, boy,\'94 Mormont commanded him. \'93
\f3 Drink.\'94 
\f1 \
Jon remained standing. \'93It\'92s my father, isn\'92t it?\'94 \
The Old Bear tapped t
\f3 he letter wit
\f1 h 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  finger. \'93Your father and the king,\'94 he rumbled. \'93I won\'92t lie to you, it\'92s grievous news. I never thought to see another king, not at my age, wit
\f3 h Robe
\f1 rt half my years and strong as a bull.\'94 He took a gulp of wine. \'93They say the king loved to hunt. The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember that. My son loved that young wife of his. Vain woman. If not for her, he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 would never have thought to sell those poachers.\'94 \
Jon could scarcely f
\f3 ollow
\f1  wha
\f3 t he was sa
\f1 ying. \'93My lord
\f3 , I don\'92t understand. What\'92s happene
\f1 d to m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  father?\'94 \
\'93I told you to sit,\'94 Mormont grumbled. \'93Sit,\'94 the raven screamed. \'93And have a drink, damn you. That\'92s a command
\f3 , Snow.\'94 
\f1 \
Jon sat, and took a sip of wine. \
\'93Lord Edd
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd has been imprisoned. He is charged with treason. It is said he plotted with Robert\'92s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Jon said at once. \'93That couldn\'92t be. My father would never betray the king!\'94 \'93Be that as it may,\'94 said Mormont. \'93It is not for me to say. Nor for you.\'94 \
\'93But it\'92s a lie,\'94 Jon insisted. How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself . . . would he? \
He fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. Where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name. \
\'93My
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lord, what will happen to him? Will they kill him?\'94 \
\'93As to that, I cannot say, lad. I mean to send a letter. I knew some of the king\'92s councillors in my youth. Old Pycelle, Lord Stannis, Se
\f3 r B
\f1 arristan . . . Whatever your father has done, or hasn\'92t done, he 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s a great lord. He must be allowe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  to take the black and join us here. Gods knows, we need men of Lord Eddard\'92s ability.\'94 \
Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in days past. Why not Lord Eddard? His father here. That was a strange thought, and strangely uncomfortable. It would be a monstrous injustice to strip h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m of Winterfell and force him to take the black, and yet if it meant his life . . . \
And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way he\'92d mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard. Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt. \'93My lord, will the king listen to 
\f3 you?\'94 \
The Old Bear shr
\f1 ugged. \'93A boy k
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng . . . I imagine he\'92ll listen to his mother. A pity the dwarf isn\'92t with them. He\'92s the lad\'92s uncle, and he saw our need when he visited us. It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captive\'97\'94 \
\'93Lady Stark is not my mother,\'94 Jon reminded him sharply. Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him. If Lord Eddard was killed, she would
\f3  be as much to bl
\f1 ame as the queen. \'93My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my father, do you know\'97\'94 \
\'93Pycelle makes no mention of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them, but doubtless they\'92ll be treated gently. I will ask about them when I write.\'94 Mormont shook his head. \'93This could not have happened at a worse time. If ever the realm needed a strong king . . . there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bo
\f3 nes . . .
\f1  \'94 He gave Jon
\f3  a long shrewd look. \'93I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy.\'94 \
H
\f1 e\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  my father, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it. His throat was dry. He made himself take another sip of wine. \
\'93Your duty is here now,\'94 the Lord Commander rem
\f3 inded 
\f1 him. \'93Your old life ended when you t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ok the black.\'94 His bird made a raucous echo. \'93Black.\'94 Mormont took no notice. \'93Whateve
\f3 r t
\f1 hey do in King\'92s Landing is none of our concern.\'94 When Jon did not answer, the old man finishe
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  his wine a
\f1 nd said, \'93You\'92re fre
\f3 e to go. I\'92ll have no further need of you today. On the morrow you can help me write that letter.\'94 \
Jon did not remember 
\f1 st
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nding or leaving the solar. The next he knew, he was descending the tower steps, thinking, This is my father, my sisters, how can it be none of my concern? \
Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said, \'93Be strong, boy. The gods are cruel.\'94 \
The
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  know, Jon realized. \'93My father is no traitor,\'94 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e said hoarsely. Even the words stuck in his throat, as if to choke him. The wind was rising, and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he\'92d gone in. Spirit summer was drawing to an end. \
The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream. Jon could not have said where he walked, what he 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 id, who he spoke with. Ghost was with him, he knew
\f3  tha
\f1 t much. The silent presence 
\f3 of the direwolf gave him comfort. 
\f1 The girls do not even have that much, he thought. Their wolves might have kept them safe, but Lady is dead and Nymeria\'92s lost, they\'92re all alone. \
A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down. Jon could hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he wen
\f3 t to the com
\f1 mon hall for the 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 vening meal. Hobb had cooked up a venison stew, thick with barley, onions, and carrots. When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon\'92s plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what it meant. He knows. He looked arou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the hall, saw heads turn quickly, eyes politely averted. They all know. \
His friends rallied to him. \'93We asked the septon to light a candle for your father,\'94 Matthar told him. \'93It\'92s a lie, we all k
\f3 now it\'92s a lie, even G
\f1 renn knows it\'92s a lie,\'94 Pyp chimed in. Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon\'92s hand, \'93You\'92re my brother now, so he\'92s my father too,\'94 the fat boy said. \'93If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I\'92ll go with you.\'94 \
The weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet he knew Sam meant what he said. They are my brothers, he thought. As much 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s Robb and Bran and Rickon . . . \
And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. \'93Not only a bastard, but a traitor\'92s bastard,\'94 he was tellin
\f3 g the 
\f1 men around him. \
In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser\'92s hand. Stew went fl
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ing everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. He lunged at Ser Alliser\'92s face with the dagger, slashing at those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around h
\f3 im, P
\f1 yp was on his back clinging 
\f3 like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his 
\f1 ar
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. \
Later, much later, after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell, Mormont came down to see him, raven on his shoulder. \'93I told you not to do anything stupid, boy,\'94 the Old Bear said. \'93Boy,\'94 the bird chorused. Mormont shook his head, disgu
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ted. \'93And to \
think I had high hopes for you.\'94 \
They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him. A
\f3 nd t
\f1 hen they placed a guard 
\f3 outside hi
\f1 s door to make certain he obeyed. His friends were not allowed to see him, but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost, so he was not utterly alone. \
\'93My father is no traitor,\'94 he told the direwolf when the rest had gone. Ghost look
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d at him in silence. Jon slumped against the wall, hands
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 around his knees, and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed. The flame flickered and swayed, the shadows moved around him, t
\f3 he ro
\f1 om seemed to grow darker and colder. I will not sleep tonight, Jon thought. \
Yet he must have dozed. When he woke, his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since burned out. Ghost stood on his hind legs, scrabbling at the door. Jon was startled to see how tall he\'92d grown. \'93Ghost, what is it?\'94 he called softly. The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him, baring his fangs in a silent snarl. Has he gone mad? Jon wondered. \'93I
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s me, Ghost,\'94 he murmured, trying not to sound afraid. Yet he was trembling, violently. When had it gotten so cold? \
Ghost backed away fr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 m the door. There were deep gouges where he\'92d raked the wood. Jon watched him with mounting disquiet. \'93There\'92s someone out there, isn\'92t there?\'94 he whispered. Crouching, the direwolf crept backward, white fur rising on 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he back of his neck. The guard, he thought, they left a man to guard my door, Ghost smells him through the door, that\'92s all it is. \
Slowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet. He was shi
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ering uncontrollably, wishing he still had a sword. Three quick steps brought him to the door. He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward. The creak of the hinges almost made him j
\f3 ump. 
\f1 \
His guard was spra
\f3 wled bonelessly a
\f1 cr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ss the narrow steps, looking up at him. Looking up at him, even though he was lying on his stomach. His head had been twisted completely around. \

\f1\fs28  slid past him, out the door. The wolf started up the steps, stopped, looked back at Jon. That was when he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone, the sound of a latch turning. The sounds came from above. From the Lord Commander\'92s chamber
\f3 s. \
A nigh
\f1 tmare this might be, yet it was no dream. \
The
\f3  guard\'92s sword was in its sheath.

\f2\b0\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ved up the steps, Ghost padding silently before him. Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair. Jon crept up warily, probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword. \
Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont\'92s raven. \'93Corn,\'94 the bird was screaming. \'93Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn.\'94 Ghost bounded ahead, and Jon came scr
\f3 ambling after. T
\f1 he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 door to Mormont\'92s solar was wide open. The direwolf plunged through. Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving his eyes a moment to adjust. Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows, and the darkness was black as ink. \'93Who\'92s there?\'94 he called out. \
Then he saw it, a shadow in the shadows, sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont\'92s sleeping cell, a man-shape all in black, cloaked and hooded . . . but beneath the hood, its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance . . . \
Ghost leapt. Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a chair,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 knocking over a table laden with papers. Mormont\'92s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, \'93Corn, corn, corn, corn.\'94 Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon. Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain. Moonlight flooded the solar. He glimpsed black hands buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf\'92s throat. Ghost 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as twisting and snapping, legs fl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 iling in the air, but he could not break free. \
Jon had no time to be afraid. He threw himself forward, shouting, bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it. Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone, yet the sound was wrong somehow. The smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged. He saw arm and han
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  on the floor, black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight. Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away, red tongue lolling from his mouth. \
The hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation. The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, eyes like blue stars burning. Jon knew that 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace. Othor, 
\f3 he tho
\f1 ught, reeling back. Gods, he\'92s dead, he\'92s dead, I saw him dead. \
He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 felt something scrabble at his ankle. Black fingers clawed at his calf. The arm was crawling up his leg, ripping at wool and flesh. Shouting with revulsion, Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away. It lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. \
The corpse lurched forward. There was no blood. One-armed, face cut near in half, it seemed to feel nothing. Jon held the longsword before him. \'93Stay away!\'94 he commanded, his voice gone shrill. \'93Corn,\'94 screamed the raven, \'93corn, corn.\'94 The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 five-fingered head. Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth. Finger bones crunched. Jon hacked at the corpse\'92s neck, felt the steel bite deep and hard. \
Dead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet. \
Jon\'92s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades. The sword, where was the sword? He\'92d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into Jon\'92s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  off, but the dead man was too heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him. Its face w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s against his own, filling the world. Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue. 
\f2\fs24 J
\f1\fs28 on raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing\'92s legs. He tried to bite, tried to punch, tried to breathe . . . \
And suddenly the corpse\'92s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat. It was all Jon could do to roll over, retching and shaking. \
Ghost had it again. He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight\'92s gut and began to rip and tear. He watched, only half conscious, for a 
\f3 long
\f1  moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . \
. . . and saw Lord Mormont, naked a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d groggy from sleep, standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand. Gnawed and fingerless, the arm thrashed on t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e floor, wriggling toward him. \
Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear\'92s fingers. The flame flickered and almost died. \'93Burn!\'94 the raven
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cawed. \'93Burn, burn, burn!\'94 \
Spinning, Jon saw the drapes he\'92d ripped from the window. He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands. Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame. The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss 
\f2\fs24 J
\f1\fs28 on had ever known. \'93Ghost!\'94 he shouted. \
The direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly. Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and whipped them at the dead man. Let it burn, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, please, let it burn. \

BRAN \
The Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning, bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from their castle at Karhold. The steel 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 oints of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as the column approached. A man went before them, p
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 unding out a slow, deep-throated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than he was, boom, boom, boom. \
Bran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall, peering through Maester Luwin\'92s bronze far-eye while perched on Hodor\'92s shoulders. Lord Rickard himself led them, his sons Harrion and Eddard and Torrhen riding beside him beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of their House. Old Nan said they had Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but they did not look like Starks to Bran. They were big men, and fierce, faces covered with thick beards, hair worn loose past the shoulders. Their cloaks were made of skins, the pelts of bear and seal and wolf. \
They were the last, he knew. The
\f3  other 
\f1 lords were already here, with their hosts. Bran yearned to ride out among them, to se
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  the winter houses full to bursting, the jostling crowds in the market square every morning, the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof. But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle. \'93We have no men to spare to guard you,\'94 his brother had explained. \
\'93I\'92ll take Summer,\'94 Bran argued. \
\'93Don\'92t act the boy with me, Bran,\'94 Robb said. \'93You know better than that. Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton\'92s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn\'92s at the Smoking Log. Our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if I let you put yourself at risk.\'94 He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when he said it; Bran knew that meant there was no appeal. \
It was because of what had happened in the wolfswood, he knew. The memory still gave him bad dreams. He had been as helpless as a baby, no more able to defend himself than Rickon would have been. Less, e
\f3 ven . . . Ric
\f1 kon would have kicked them, at the least. It shamed him. He was only a few years younger tha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Robb; if his brother was almost a man grown, so was he. He should have been able to protect himself. \
A year ago, before, he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the \
walls by himself. In those days he could run down stairs, get on and off his pony by himself, and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt. Now he could only watch, peering out through Maester Luwin\'92s lens tube. The maester had taught him all the banners: the mailed fist of the Glovers, silver 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n scarlet; Lady Mormont\'92s black bear; the hideous flayed man that went before Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort; a bull moose for the Hornwoods; a battle-axe for the Cerwyns; three sentinel trees for the Tallharts; and the fearsome sigil of House Umber, a roaring giant in shattered chains. \
And soon enough he learned the faces too, when the lords and their son
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and knights retainer came to Winterfell to feast. Even the Great Hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once, so Robb hosted each of the principal bannermen in turn. Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother\'92s right hand. Some of the lords bannermen gave him queer 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ard stares as he sat there, as if they wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them, and him a cripple too. \
\'93How many is it now?\'94 Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his sons rode through the gates in the outer wall. \
\'93Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter.\'94 \'93How many knights?\'94 \
\'93Few enough,\'94 the maester said with a touch of impatience. \'93To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights . . . but those lords and the
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable. A man\'92s worth is not marked by a ser before his name. As I have told you a hundred times before.\'94 \
\'93Still,\'94 said Bran, \'93how many knights?\'94 \
Maester Luwin sighed. \'93Three hundred, perhaps four . . . among three thousand armored lances who are not knights.\'94 \
\'93Lord Karstark is the last,\'94 Bran said thoughtfully. \'93Robb will feast him tonight.\'94 \'93No doubt he will.\'94\
\'93How long before . . . before they go?\'94\
\'93He must march soon, or not at all,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \'93The winte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  town is full to \
bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer. Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad, barrow knights and 
\f3 cranno
\f1 gmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint. The fighting has begun in the riverlands, and your brother has many leagues to go.\'94 \
\'93I know.\'94 Bran felt as miserable as he sounded. He handed the bronze tube back to the maester, and noticed how thin Luwin\'92s hair had grown on top. He could see the pink of scalp showing through. It felt queer to look down on him this way
\f3 , when he
\f1 \'92d spent his whole life looking up at him, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut when you sat on Hodor\'92s back you looked down on everyone. \'93I don\'92t want to watch anymore. Hodor, take me back to the keep.\'94 \
\'93Hodor,\'94 sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d Hodor. \
Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve. \'93Bran, your lord brother will not have time to see you now. He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome.\'94 \
\'93I won\'92t trouble Robb. I want to visit the godswood.\'94 He put his hand on Hodor\'92s shoulder. \'93Hodor.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28  series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower\'92s inner wall. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand, Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for him. Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread Bran\'92s weight more evenly. It was not as good as riding Dancer, but there were places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby. Hodor seemed to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky part was doors. Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when he went through a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 door. \
For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them, even in the dead of night. A long column of armore
\f3 d lan
\f1 cers 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following their lords into the castle. They wore black iron 
\f3 halfh
\f1 elms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst. Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to himself, his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge. The riders gave them queer looks as they went by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw. He refused to let it trouble him. \'93Men will look at you,\'94 Maester Luwin had wa
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor\'92s chest. \'93They will look, and they will talk, and some will mock you.\'94 Let them mock, Bran thought. No one mocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in bed. \
As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled. Summer came loping across the yard. Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control, as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay. One stallion reared, screaming, his rider cursing and hanging on desperately. The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it, but they\'92d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone. \'93The godswood,\'94 Bran reminded Hodor. \
Even Winterfell itself was crowded. The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe, the rumble of wagons, and the barking of dogs. The armory doors were open, and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge, his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest. Bran
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had never seen as many strangers in all his years, not even when King Robert had come to visit Father. \
He tried n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door. They walked down a long dim hallway, Summer padding easily besid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  them. The wolf glanced up from time to time, eyes smoldering like liquid gold. Bran would have liked to touch him, but he was riding too high for his hand to reach. \
The godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become. Hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels, to the still pool beside the heart tree. He stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood, humming. Bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out of his seat, drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker basket. He hung for a moment, dangling, the dark red leaves brushing against his face, until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water. \'93I want to be by myself for a while,\'94 he said. \'93You go soak. Go to the pools.\'94 \
\'93Hodor.\'94 H
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 dor stomped through the trees and vanished. Across the godswood, beneath the windows of the Guest House, an underground hot spring fed three small ponds. Steam rose from the water day and night, and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss. Hodor hated cold water, and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to bre
\f3 ak upon
\f1  the surface. \
Summer lapped at the 
\f3 water
\f1  an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  settled down at Bran\'92s side. He rubbed the wolf under the jaw, and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even the heart tree no longe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  scared him the way it used to. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from that now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest, his father\'92s gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the \
deep silence of the trees helped him think. Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with the gods. \
\'93Please make it so Robb won\'92t go 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 way,\'94 he prayed softly. He moved his hand through the cold water, sending ripples across the pool. \'93P
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ease make him stay. Or if he has to go, bring him home safe, with Mother and Father and the girls. And make it . . . make it so Rickon understands.\'94 \
His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was riding off 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o war, weeping and angry by turns. He\'92d refused to eat, cried and screamed for most of a night, even punched Old Nan when she tried to sing him to sleep, and the next day he\'92d vanished. Robb had set half the castle searching for him, and when at last they\'92d found him down in the crypts, Rickon had slashed at them with a rusted iron sword he\'92d snatched from a dead king\'92s hand, and Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon. The wolf was near as wild as Rickon; he\'92d bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken\'92s thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring him to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried all the more for being without him. \
Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with him too, for his own sake as much as Rickon\'92s, but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said, \'93I don\'92t want to go. I have to.\'94 \
It was only half a lie. Someone had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to go, to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters, Bran could understand that, but it did not have to be Robb. His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy, or to one of his lords bannermen. Maester Luwin urged him to do just that, but Robb would not hear of it. \'93My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell,\'94 he said, all Robb the Lord. \
Robb seemed half a stranger to Bran now, transformed, a lord in truth, though he had not yet seen his sixteenth name day. Even their father\'92s bannermen seeme
\f3 d to se
\f1 nse it. Many tried to test him, each in his own way. Roose Bolto
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  and Robett Glover both demanded the honor of battle command, the first brusquely, the second with a smile and a jest. Stout, grey-haired Maege Mormont, dressed in mail like a man, told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her commands . . . but as it happened, she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. Soft-spoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him, a plump, homely maid of thirty years who sat at her father\'92s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate. Jovial Lord Hornwood had no daughters, but he did br
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng gifts, a horse one day, a haunch of venison the next, a silver-chased hunting horn the day after, and he asked nothing in return . . . nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his \
grandfather, and hunting rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife, if it please the lord
\f3 . \
R
\f1 obb answered each of them with cool courtesy, much as Father might have, and somehow he bent them to his will. \
And when Lord Umber, who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice as wide, threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march, Robb told him he was welcome to do so. \'93And when we are done with the Lannisters,\'94 he promised, scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, \'93we will march back north, root you out of your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker.\'94 Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bell
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wed that Robb was so green he must
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 piss grass. When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him, he knocked him to the floor, kicked over a table, and unsheathed the biggest, ugliest grea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 sword that Bran had ever seen. All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet, grabbing for their steel. \
Yet Robb only said a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord 
\f2\fs24 U
\f1\fs28 mber was on his back, his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two 
\f3 fing
\f1 ers. \'93My lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,\'94 Robb said, \'93but doubtless you only meant to cut my m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 at.\'94 Bran\'92s bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise, sucking at the red stumps of fingers . . . but then, astonishingly, the huge man laughed. \'93Your meat,\'94 he roared, \'93is bloody tough.\'94 \
And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb\'92s right hand, his staunchest champion, loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark after all, and they\'92d damn well better bend their knees if they didn\'92t fancy having them chewed off. \
Yet that very night, his brother came to Bran\'92s bedchamber pale and shaken, after the fires had burned l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w in the Great Hall. \'93I thought he was going to kill me,\'94 Robb confessed. \'93Did you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 see the way he threw down Hal, like he was no bigger than Rickon? Gods, I was so scared. And th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Greatjon\'92s not the worst of them, only the loudest. Lord Roose never says a word, he only looks at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me, and all I can think of is that room they have in the Dreadfort, where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s just one of Old Nan\'92s stories,\'94 Bran said. A note of doubt crept into his voice. \'93Isn\'92t it?\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t know.\'94 He gave a weary shake of his head. \'93Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us. To cook for him, he says. Theon is certain I\'92ll find the girl in my bedroll one n
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ght. I wish . . . I wish
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Father was here . . . \'94 \
That was the one thing they could agree on, Bran and Rickon and Robb the Lord; they all wished Father was here. But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues away, a captive in some dungeon, a hunted fugitive running for his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 life, or even dead. No one seemed to know for certain; every traveler told a different tale, each more terrifying than the last. The heads of Father\'92s guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the Red Keep, impaled on spikes. King Robert was dead at Father\'92s hands. The Ba
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 atheons had laid siege to King\'92s Landing. Lord Eddard had fled south with the king\'92s wicked brother Renly. Arya and Sansa had been murdered by the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Hound. Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of Ri
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 errun. Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie, burning and slaughtering as he went. One wine-sodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshal
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim his father\'92s throne. \
When the raven came, bearing a lett
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r marked with Father\'92s own seal and written in Sansa\'92s hand, the cruel truth seemed no less incredible. Bran would never forget the look on Robb\'92s face as he stared at their sister\'92s words. \'93She says Fath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r conspired at treason with the king\'92s brothers,\'94 he read. \'93King Robert is dead, and Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey. She says we must be loyal, and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our lord father\'92s life.\'94 His fingers closed into a fist, crushing Sansa\'92s letter between them. \'93And she says nothing of Arya, nothing, not so much as a word. Damn her! What\'92s wrong with the girl?\'94 \
Bran felt all cold inside. \'93She lost her wolf,\'94 he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of his father\'92s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady\'92s bones. Summer
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. Beneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, where the old Kings of Winter had 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 aid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her brothers stalk
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d b
\f3 etwe
\f1 en the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had returned. \
Their grandfather, old Lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Rickard, had gone as well, with his son Brandon who was Father\'92s brother, and two hundred of his best men. None had ever returned. And Father had gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had
\f3  gon
\f1 e, and they hadn\'92t come back either. And now Robb meant to go. Not to King\'92s Landing a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d not to swear fealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in his hand. And if their lord father were truly a prisoner, that could mean his death for a certainty. It frightened Bran more than he could say. \
\'93If Robb has to go, watch over him,\'94 Bran entreated the old gods, as they watched him with the heart tree\'92s red eyes, \'93and watch over his men, Hal 
\f3 and Q
\f1 uent and the rest, and Lord Umber an
\f3 d La
\f1 dy Mormont and the other lords. And Theon too, I suppose. Watch them and keep them safe, if it please you, gods. Help them defeat the Lannisters and \
save Father and bring them home.\'94 \
A faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered. Summer bared his teeth. \'93You hear them, boy?\'94 a voice asked. \
Bran lifted his head. Osha stood across the pool, beneath an ancient oak, her face shadowed by leaves. Even
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in iro
\f3 ns
\f1 , the wildling moved quiet as a cat. Summer
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 circled the pool, sniffed at her. The tall woman flinched. \
\'93Summer, to me,\'94 Bran called. The direwolf took one final sniff, spun, and bounded ba
\f3 ck. B
\f1 ran wrapped his arms around
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. \'93What are you doing here?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  He had not seen Osha since they\'92d taken her captive in the wolfswood, though he knew she\'92d been set to working in the kitchens. \
\'93They are my gods too,\'94 Osha said. \'93Beyond the Wall, they are the only gods.\'94 Her hair was growing out, brown and shaggy. It made her look more womanly, that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they\'92d given her when they took her mail and leather. \'93Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need. It\'92s nothing to me. I like the smell of flour on his hands, and he\'92s gentler than Stiv.\'94 She gave an awkward bow. \'93I\'92ll leave you. There\'92s pots that want s
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ouring.\'94 \
\'93No, stay,\'94 Bran commanded her. \'93Tell me what you meant, about hearing the gods.\'94 \
Osha studied
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 him. \'93You asked them and they\'92re answering. Open your ears, listen, you\'92ll hear.\'94 \
Bran listened. \'93It\'92s only the wind,\'94 he said after a moment, uncertain. \'93The leaves are rustling.\'94 \
\'93Who do you think sends the wind, if not the gods?\'94 She seated herself across the pool from him, clinking faintly as she moved. Mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles, with a heavy chain between them; she could wa
\f2\fs24 l
\f3\fs28 k, so 
\f1 long as she kept her strides small, but there was no way for her to run, or climb, or mount a horse. \'93They see you, boy. They hear you talking. That rustling, that\'92s them talking back.\'94 \
\'93What are they saying?\'94 \
\'93The
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 \'92re sad. Your lord brother will get no help from them, not where he\'92s going. The old g
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ds have no power in the south. The weirwoods there were all cut down, thousands of years ago. How can they watch your brother when they have no eyes?\'94 \
B
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 an had not though
\f3 t of 
\f1 that. It frightened him. If even the gods could not help
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his brother, what hope was there? Maybe Osha wasn\'92t hearing them right. He cocked his head and tried to listen again. He thought he could hear the sadness now, but nothing more than that. \
The rustling grew louder. Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming, and Hodor came blundering out of the trees, naked and smiling. \'93Hodor!\'94 \
\'93He must have he
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rd our voices,\'94 Bran said. \'93Hodor, you forgot your clothes.\'94 \
\'93Hodor,\'94 Hodor agreed. He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming in the chill air. His body was cov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red with brown hair, thick as a pelt. Between his legs, his manhood swung long and heavy. \
Osha eyed him with a sour smile. \'93Now there\'92s a big man,\'94 she said. \'93He has giant\'92s blood in him, or I\'92m the queen.\'94 \
\'93Maester Luwin says there are no more giants. He says they\'92re all dead, like the children of the forest. All that\'92s left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time.\'94 \
\'93Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall,\'94 Osha said. \'93He\'92ll find giants then, or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 they\'92ll find him. My brother killed one. Ten foot tall she was, and stunted at that. They\'92ve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet. Fierce things they are too, all hai
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  and teeth, and the wives have beards like their husbands, so there\'92s no telling them apart. The women take human men for lovers, and it\'92s from them the half bloods come. It goes harder on the women they catch. The men are so big they\'92ll rip a maid apart before they get her with child.\'94 She grinned at him. \'93But you don\'92t know what I mean, do you, boy?\'94 \
\'93Yes I do,\'94 Bran insisted. He understood about mating;
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he had seen dogs in the yard, and watched a stallion mount a mare. But talking about it made him uncomfortable. He l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 oked at Hodor. \'93Go back and bring your clothes, Hodor,\'94 he said. \'93Go dress.\'94 \
\'93Hodor.\'94 He walked back the way he had come
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  ducking under a low-hanging tree limb. \
He was awfully big, Bran thought as he 
\f3 wat
\f1 ched him go. \'93Are there truly giants beyond the Wall?\'94 he asked Osha, uncertainl
\f3 y. \
\'93Giants
\f1  a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 when he asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy. The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires and nev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r come back . . . or if they do, they\'92re not men no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands. Why do you think I run \
south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? Mance thinks he\'92ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were no more than rangers, but what does he know? He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he\'92s still just another old bla
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower.
\f3  He\'92s never tasted winter. 
\f1 I was born up there, child, like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk. We remember.\'94 Osha stood, her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 chains rattling together. \'93I tried to tell your lordling brother. Only yesterday, when I saw him in the yard. \'91M\'92lord Stark,\'92 I called to him, respectful as you please, but he looked through me, and that sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path. So be it. I\'92ll wear my irons and hold my tongue. A man who won\'92t listen can\'92t hear.\'94 \
\'93Tell me. Robb will listen to me, I know he will.\'94 \
\'93Will he now? We\'92ll see. You tell him this, m\'92lord. You tell him he\'92s bound on marching the wrong way.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 It\'92s north he should be taking his swords. North, not south. You hear me?\'94 \
Bran nodded. \'93I\'92ll tell him.\'94 \
But that night, when they feasted in the Great Hall, Robb was not with them. He took his meal in the solar instead, with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the other lords bannermen, to make the f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nal plans for the long march to come. It was le
\f2\fs24 f
\f1 \cf3 t to Bran\cf2  t\cf3 o fill his place a\cf2 t \cf3 the h
\f2 \cf2 e
\f1 \cf3 ad of the\cf2  t\cf3 able, and act the \cf2 ho\cf3 st to
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 Lord Kars
\f2\b0\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ark\'92s sons and honored friends. They were already at their places when Hodor carried Bran into the hall on his back, and knelt beside the high seat. Two of the serving men helped lift him from his basket. Bran could feel the eyes of every stranger in the hall. It had grown quiet. \'93My lords,\'94 Hallis Mollen announced, \'93Brandon Stark, of Winterfell.\'94 \
\'93
\f3 I we
\f1 lcome you to our fires,\'94 Bran said stiffly, \'93and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship.\'94 \
Harrion Karstark, the oldest 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f Lord Rickard\'92s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. \'93 . . . sooner die than live like that,\'94 muttered one, his fathe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 \'92s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out, too craven to take his own life. \
Broken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his kn
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 fe. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken? \'93I don\'92t want to be broken,\'94 he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who\'92d been seated to his right. \'93I want to be a knight.\'94 \
\'93There a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e some who call my order the knights of the mind,\'94 Luwin replied. \'93You are a \
surpassing clever boy when you work at it, Bran. Have you ever thought that you might wear a maester\'92s chain? There is no limit to what you might learn.\'94 \
\'93I want to learn magic,\'94 Bran told him. \'93The crow promised that I would fly.\'94 \
Ma
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ster Luwin sighed. \'93I can teach you history, healing, herblore. I can teach you the speech 
\f3 of rave
\f1 ns, and how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars. I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons, and at t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more. But, Bran, no man can teach you magic.\'94 \
\'93The children could,\'94 Bran said. \'93The children of the forest.\'94 That reminded him of the promise he had made to Osha in the godswood, so he told Luwin what she had said. \
The maester listened politely. \'93The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think,\'94 he said when Bran was done. \'93I wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l talk wit
\f3 h her
\f1  again if you like, but it would be best if you did not trouble your b
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 other with this folly. He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods. It\'92s the Lannisters who hold your lord father, Bran, not the children of the forest.\'94 He put a gentle hand on Bran\'92s arm. \'93Think on what I said, child.\'94 \
And two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found himself i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the yard beneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother. \
\'93You are the lord in Winterfell now,\'94 Robb told him. He was mounted on a shaggy grey
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 stallion, his shield hung from the horse\'92s side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagge
\f3 r at his 
\f1 waist, a fur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders. \'93You must take my pla
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e, as I took Father\'92s, until we com
\f3 e hom
\f1 e.\'94 \
\'93I know,\'94 Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or scared. He did not know how to be a lord. \
\'93Listen to Maester Luwin\'92s counsel, and take care of Rickon. Tell him that I\'92ll be back as soon as the fighting is done.\'94 \
Rickon had refused to come down. He was
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 up in his chamber,
\f3  red
\f1 eyed and defiant. \'93No!\'94 he\'92d screamed when Bran had asked if he didn\'92t want to say farewell to Robb. \'93NO farewell!\'94 \
\'93I told him,\'94 Bran said. \'93He says no one ever comes back.\'94 \
\'93He can\'92t be a baby forever. He\'92s a Stark, and near four.\'94 Robb sighed. \'93Well, Mother will be home soon. And I\'92ll bring back Father, I promise.\'94 \
He wheeled his courser
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 around and trotted away. Grey Wind followed, loping beside the warhorse, lean and swift. Hallis Mollen went before them through the gate, carrying the rippling white banner of House S
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ark atop a high standard of grey ash. Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb, and their knights formed up in a double column behind them, steel-tipped lances glinting in the sun. \
Uncomfortably, he remembered Osha\'92s words. He\'92s marching the wrong w
\f3 ay, he thoug
\f1 ht. For an instant he wanted to g
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 llop after him and shout a warning, but when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis, the moment
\f3  was gon
\f1 e. \
Beyond the castle walls, a roar of sound went up. The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb as he rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, for the Lord of Winterfell on his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 great stallion, with his cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside him. They would never cheer for him that way, he realized with a dull ache. He might be the lord in Winterfell w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ile his brother and father were gone, but he was still Bran the Broken. He could not even get off his own horse, except
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to fall. \
When the
\f3  dis
\f1 tant cheers had faded to silence
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and the yard was empty at last, Winterfell seemed deserted and dead. Bran looked around at the faces of those who remained, women and children and old men . . . and Hodor. The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened loo
\f3 k to 
\f1 his face. \'93Hodor?\'94 he said sadly. \
\'93Hodor,\'94 Bran agreed, wondering what it meant. \

DAENERYS \
When he had taken his pleasure, Khal Drogo ros
\f3 e fro
\f1 m their sleeping ma
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 s to tower above her. His skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier, the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad chest. Ink-black hair, loose and unbound, cascaded over his shoulders and down his back, well past his waist. His manhood glistened wetly. The khal\'92s mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio. \'93The stallion 
\f2\fs24 w
\f3\fs28 ho mounts the world has no need of ir
\f1 on chairs.\'94 \
Dany proppe
\f3 d herself on an elbow
\f1  to look u
\f3 p at him
\f1 , so tall and magnificent. She loved his hair especially. It had never been cut; he had never known defeat. \'93It was p
\f3 rophesied tha
\f1 t the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth,\'94 she said. \
\'93The earth ends at the black salt sea,\'94 Drogo answered at once. He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin. \'93No horse can cross the poison water.\'94 \
\'93In the Free Cities, there are ships by the thousand,\'94 Dany told him, a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  she had told him before. \'93Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on wings full of wind.\'94 \
Khal Drogo did not want to hear it. \'93We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.\'94 He dropped the cloth and began to dress. \'93This day I will go to the grass and hunt, woman wife,\'94 he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, g
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ld, and bronze. \
\'93Yes, my sun-and-stars,\'94 Dany said. Drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar, the great white lion of the plains. If they returned triumphant, her lord husband\'92s joy would be fierce, and he might be willing to hear her out. \
Savage beasts he did not fear, nor any man who had ever drawn breath, but the sea was a different matter. To the Dothraki, water that a horse could not drink was something foul; the heaving grey-green plains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing. Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways
\f3 , she had fou
\f1 nd . . . but not in this. If only she could get him onto a ship . . . \
After the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ir bows, Dany summoned her \
handmaids. Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands, whereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her. They scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk, loose and flowing. As Doreah combed out her hair, she sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont. \
The knight came at once. He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest, like a rider. Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms. \'93My princess. How may I serve you?\'94 \
\'93You must talk to my lord husband,\'94 Dany said. \'93Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule, and no need to cross the poison water. He talks of leading his khalasar east after Rhaego is born, to plunder th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  lands around the Jade Sea.\'94 \
The knigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  looked thoughtful. \'93The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms,\'94 he said. \'93They are nothing to him. If he thinks of them at all, no doubt he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or Lys, surrounded by stormy seas. The riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect.\'94 \
\'93But he must ride west,\'94 Dany said, despairing. \'93Please, help me make him understand.\'94 She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her. Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day, but he was dead now and his promises had died with him. \
\'93The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons,\'94 the knight answered. \'93Have patience, Princess. Do not make your brother\'92s mistake. We will go home, I promise you.\'94 \
Home? The word made her feel sad. Ser Jorah had his Bear Island, but what was home to her? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, the fading memory of a red door . . . was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever? When she looked at the crones of the dosh khalee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , was she looking at her future? \
Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face. \'93A great caravan arrived during the night, Khaleesi. Four hundr
\f3 ed hor
\f1 ses, from Pentos by way of Norvos and Qohor, under the command of Merchant Captain Byan Votyris. Illyrio may have sent a letter. Would you care to visit the Western Market?\'94 \
Dany stirred. \'93Yes,\'94 she said. \'93I would like that.\'94 The markets came alive when a caravan had come in. You cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time, and it \
would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again, as they did in the Free Cities. \'93Irri, h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ve them prepare a litter.\'94 \
\'93I shall
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tell your khas,\'94 Ser Jorah said, withdrawing. \
If Khal Drogo had been with her, Dany would have ridden her silver. Among the Dothraki, mothers stayed on
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 horseba
\f1 ck almost up to the moment of birth, and she did not want to seem weak in her husband\'92s eyes. But with the khal off hunting, it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak, with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun. Ser Jorah saddled up and rode beside her, with the four young men of her khas and her handma
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ds. \
The day was warm and cloudless, the sky a deep blue. When the wind blew, she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth. As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments, she went from sunlight to shadow and back again. Dany swayed along, studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings. She wondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers. \
If I were not the blood of the dragon, she thought wistfully, this could be my home. She 
\f3 was k
\f1 haleesi, she had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep her safe, an honored place in
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew\
old . . . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world. That sho
\f3 uld be e
\f1 nough for any woman . . . but 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot for the dragon. With Viserys gone, Daenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors, and so too the child inside her. She must not forget. \
The 
\f2\fs24 W
\f1\fs28 estern Market was a great square of beaten ea
\f3 rth surrounde
\f1 d by warrens of mud- baked brick, animal pens, whitewa
\f3 shed dri
\f1 nki
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g halls. Hummocks rose
\f3  fro
\f1 m the ground like the backs of great subterr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nean beasts breaking the surface, yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below. The interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles, shaded by awnings of woven grass. \
A hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived, yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming b
\f3 azaars t
\f1 hat Dany remembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities. The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained. The riders let them come and go unmolested, so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city, did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt, silver, and seed. The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and selling. \
Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all its queer sights and sounds and smells. She often spent her mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped black
\f2\fs24 -
\f1\fs28 and-white horses of the Jogo
\f3 s Nhai. 
\f1 She enjoyed watching all the people too: dark solemn Asshai\'92i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids from Bayasabhad, Sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 myriana, and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks, even the dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks. The Eastern
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Market was a place of wonder and magic for Dany. \
But the Western Market smelled of home. \
As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, she sniffed, and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepp
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace. Under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys. She saw slaves carrying bolts of intricate Myrish lac
\f3 e and fin
\f1 e wools in a dozen rich colors. Caravan guards wandered
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 among the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts. Behind one stall an armor
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns, and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts. Next to him was a pretty young woman se
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ling Lannisport goldwork, rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions suitable for belting. A huge eunuch guarded her stall, mute and hairless, dressed in sw
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 at-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close. Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ead. \
\'93When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,\'94 Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. \'93It was so
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, so many wonderful things to lo
\f3 ok
\f1  at . . . though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything . . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  well, except for a sausage now and again, or honeyfingers . . . do they have h
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 neyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind they bake in Tyrosh?\'94 \
\'93Cakes, are they

\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wed. \'93If you would pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us.\'94 \
\'93Very well. I\'92ll help you find him.\'94 \
\'93There is no need for you to trouble yourself.\'94 Ser Jorah glanced away impatiently. \'93Enjoy the market. I will rejoin you when my business is concluded.\'94 \
Curious, Dany thought as she watched him stride
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 off through the throngs. She didn\'92t see why she should not go w
\f3 ith h
\f1 im. Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain. Who
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 es frequently traveled with the caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about their couplings. She gave a shru
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 . \'93Come,\'94 she told the others. \
Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market. \'93Oh, look,\'94 she exclaimed to Doreah, \'93those are the kind
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of sausages I meant.\'94 She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone. \'93They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers.\'94 Delighted with her discove
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y, Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage. Her ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 dmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning, though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously. \'93They taste different than I remember,\'94 Dany said after her first few bites. \
\'93In Pent
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 s, I make them with pork,\'94 the old woman said, \'93but a
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. These are made of horsemeat, Khaleesi, but I spice them the same.\'94 \
\'93Oh.\'94 Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e, an
\f3 d Rak
\f1 haro had to outdo him and eat three more, belching loudly. Dany giggled. \
\'93You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crow
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed by Drogo,\'94 said Irri. \'93It is good to see, Khaleesi.\'94 \
Dany smiled shyly. It was sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again. \
They wandered for half the morning. She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles, and took it for a gift. In return, she ga
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e the m
\f3 er
\f1 chant a silver medallion from her belt. That was how it was done among the Dothraki. A birdseller taught a green- and-red parrot to say her name, and Dany laughed again, 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 et still refused to take him. What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a khalasar?
\f3  She d
\f1 id take a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of her childhood; she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big house with the red door once more. When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 charm at a magician\'92s booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, thinking that now she should find something for Irri and Jhiqui as well. \
Turning a corner, they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized cups of his wares to the passersby. \'93Sweet reds,\'94 he cried in fluent Dothraki, \'93I have sweet reds, from
\f3  Lys
\f1  and Volantis and the Arbor. Whites from Lys, Tyroshi pear brandy, firewine, pepperwine, the pale green nectars of Myr. Smokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them.\'94 He was a small man, slender and handsome, his flaxen
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys. When Dany paused before his stall, he \
bowed low. \'93A taste for the khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady
\f3 , it
\f1  s
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ngs of plums and 
\f3 cherries
\f1  and rich dark oak. A cask, a cup, a swallow? One taste, and you will name your child after me.\'94 \
Dany smiled. \'93My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,\'94 she said in Valyrian, Valyria
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  as they spoke it in the Free Cities. The words felt strange on her tongue, after so long. \'93Just a taste, if you would be so kind.\'94 \
The merchant must have taken her for Dothraki, with her clothes and her oiled hair and sun-browned skin. When she spoke, he gaped at her in astonishment. \'93My lady, you\
are . . . Tyroshi? Can it be so?\'94 \
\'93My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of the Sunset Kingdoms,\'94 Dany told him. \
Doreah stepped up beside her. \'93You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Daenerys Stormborn, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the Seven Kingdoms.\'94 \
The wine merchant dropped to his knees. \'93Princess,\'94 he said, bowing his head.\
\'93Rise,\'94 Dany commanded him. \'93I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of.\'94 \
The man bounded 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o his feet. \'93That? Dornish swill. It is not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor, crisp and delectable. Please, let me give you a cask.\'94 \
Khal Drogo\'92s vis
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ts to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good wine, and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him. \'93You honor me, ser,\'94 she murmured sweetly. \
\'93The honor is mine.\'94 The merchant rummaged a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 out in the back of his stall and produced a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 small oaken cask. Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes. \'93The Redwyne sigil,\'94 he said, 
\f3 pointing, \'93for the Arbor. There is n
\f1 o finer drink.\'94 \
\'93Khal Drogo and I will share it together. Aggo, take this back to my litter, if you\'92d be so kind.\'94 The wineseller beamed as the Dothraki hefted the cask. \
She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say, \'93No.\'94 H
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s voice was strange, brusque. \'93Aggo, put down that cask.\'94 \
Aggo looked at Dany. She gave a hesitant nod. \'93Ser Jorah, is something wrong?\'94 \
\'93I have a thirst. Open it, wineseller.\'94\
The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 m
\f3 erchant 
\f1 frowned. \'93The wine is for the khaleesi, not for the likes of you, ser.\'94 \
Ser Jorah moved closer to the stall. \'93If you don\'92t open it, I\'92ll crack it open with your head.\'94 He carried 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 o weapons here in the sacred city, save his hands\'97yet his hands were enough, big, hard, dangerous, hi
\f3 s knuckles cove
\f1 red with coarse dark hairs. The wineseller hesitated a moment, then took up 
\f3 his hammer and knocked the plug from the cask. \
\'93Pour,\'94 Ser Jorah commanded. The four young w
\f1 arriors of Dany\'92s khas ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ayed themselves behind him, frowning, watching with their dark, almond-shaped eyes. \
\'93It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.\'94 The wineseller had not put his hammer down. \
Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt, but Dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm. \'93Do as Ser Jorah says,\'94 she said. People were stop
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ing to watch. \
The man gave her a quick, sullen glance. \'93As the princess commands.\'94 He had to set aside his hammer to lift the cask. He filled two thimble-sized tasting 
\f2\fs24 c
\f3\fs28 ups, pouring so deftly he did not spill 
\f1 a drop. \
Ser Jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine, frowning. \
\'93Sweet, isn\'92t it?\'94 the wineseller said, smiling. \'93Can you smell the fruit, ser? The perfume of the Arbor. Taste it, my lord, and tell me it isn\'92t the finest, richest wine that\'92s ev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r touched your tongue.\'94 \
Ser Jorah offered him the cup. \'93You taste it first.\'94 \
\'93Me?\'94 The man laughed. \'93I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord. And it\'92s a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares
\f3 .\'94 Hi
\f1 s smile was amiable, yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow. \
\'93You will drink
\f3 ,\'94 Dany 
\f1 said, cold as ice. \'93Empty 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ask down your throat.\'94 \
The wineseller shrugged, reached for the cup . . . and grabbed the cask instead, 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 linging it at her with both hands. Ser Jorah bulled into her, knocking her out of the way. The cask bounced off his shoulder an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  smashed open on the ground. Dany stumbled and lost her \
feet. \'93No,\'94 she screamed, thrusting her hands out to break her fall . . . and Doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward, so she landed on her legs and not her belly. \
The trader vaulted over the stall, darting between Aggo and Rakharo. Quaro reached for an arakh that was not there as the blond man sla
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 med him aside. He raced down the aisle. Dany heard the snap of Jhogo\'92s whip, saw the leather lick out and coil around the wineseller\'92s leg. The man sprawled face first in the dirt. \
A dozen caravan gua
\f3 rds 
\f1 had come running. With them was the master himself, Merchant Captain Byan Votyris, a dimin
\f3 utive Nor
\f1 voshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to his ears. 
\f3 He se
\f1 emed to know what had happened without a word being spoken. \'93Take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal,\'94 he commanded, gesturing at the man on the ground. Two guards hauled the wineseller to his feet. \'93His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,\'94 the merchant captain went on. \'93Small token of regret, that one of mine would do this thing.\'94 \
Dore
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 h an
\f3 d Jhiqui 
\f1 helped Dany back to her feet. The poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask into the dirt. \'93How did you know?\'94 she asked Ser Jorah, trembling. \'93How?\'94 \
\'93I did not know, Khaleesi, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read Magister Illyrio\'92s letter, I feared.\'94 His dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market. \'93Come. Best not to talk of it here.\'94 \
Dany was near tears as they carri
\f2\fs24 e
\f1 \cf3 d her bac\cf2 k.\cf3  The taste in her \cf2 mo\cf3 uth w
\f2 \cf2 a
\f1 \cf3 s one she\cf2  h\cf3 ad known before: f\cf2 ea\cf3 r. Fo
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38  years s
\f2\b0\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It was not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. He must have sensed her fright, for he moved restlessly inside her. Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently, wishing she could reach him, touch him, soothe him. \'93You are the blood of the dragon, little
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 one,\'94 she whispered as her litter swayed along, curtains drawn tight. \'93You are the blood of the d
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 agon, and the dragon does not fear.\'94 \
Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak, Dany ordered them to leave her\'97all but Ser Jorah. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Tell me,\'94 she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions. \'93Was it the Usurper?\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 The knight drew out a folded parchment. \'93A letter to Viserys, from Magister Illyrio. Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death, or your brother\'92s.\'94 \
\'93My brother?\'94 Her sob was half a laugh. \'93He does not know yet, does he? The Usurper owes Drogo a lordship.\'94 This time her laugh was half a sob. She hugged herself protectively. \'93And me, you said. Only me?\'94 \
\'93You and the child,\'94 Ser Jorah said, grim. \
\'93No. He cannot have my son.\'94 She would not weep, she decided. She would not shiver with fear. The Usurper has woken the dragon now, she told he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 self . . . and her eyes went to the dragon\'92s eggs resting in their nest of dark velvet. The shifting lamplight limned their stony scales, and shimmering motes of jade and scarlet and gold swam in the air around them, like courtiers around a king. \
Was it madness that seized her then, born of fear? Or some strange wisdom buried in her blood? Dany could not have said. She heard her own voice saying, \'93Ser Jorah, light the brazier.\'94 \
\'93Khaleesi?\'94 The knight looked at her strangely. \'93It is so hot. Are you certain?\'94 She had never been so certain. \'93Yes. I . . . I have a chill. Light the brazier.\'94\
He bowed. \'93As you command.\'94 \
When the coals were afire, Dany sent Ser Jorah from her. She had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to be alone to do what she must do. This is madness, she told herself as she lifted the black-and-scarlet egg from the velvet. It will only crack and burn, and it\'92s so beautif
\f3 ul, Ser Jorah will call me a fo
\f1 ol if I ruin it, and yet, and yet . . . \
Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to the fire and pushed it down amongst the burning 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 oals. The black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 gainst the stone with small red tongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As she stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled in her throat. \
She watched until the coals had turned to ashes. Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole. Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon\'92s eggs. And that was all. \
Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, Ser Jorah had said. D
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ny gazed at her eggs sadly. What had she expected? A thousand thousand years ago they had been alive, but now they were only pretty rocks. They could not make a dragon. A dragon was air and fire. Living flesh, not dead stone. \
The brazier was cold again by the time Khal Drogo returned. Cohollo was leading a packhorse behind him, with the carcass of a great white lion slung across its back. Above, the stars were 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 oming out. The khal laughed as he swung down off his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the hrakkar had raked him through his \
leggings. \'93I shall make you a cloak of its skin, moon of my life,\'94 he swore. \
When Dany told him what had happened at the market, all laughter stopped, and Khal Drogo grew very quiet. \
\'93This poisoner was the first,\'94 Ser Jorah Mormont warned him, \'93but he will not be the last. Men will risk much for a lordship.\'94 \
Drogo was silent for a time. Finally he said, \'93This seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life. Better he should run after her. So he will. Jhogo, Jorah the Andal, to each of you I s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y, choose any horse you wish from my herds, and it is yours. Any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the moon of my life. I make this gift to you for what you did. \
\'93And to Rhaego son of Drogo, the stallion who will mount the world, to him I also pledge a gift. To him I will give this iron chair his mother\'92s father sat in. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I, Drogo, khal, will do this thing.\'94 His voice rose, and he lifted his fist to the sky. \'93I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before. I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods ba
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains. This I vow, I
\f3 , Dro
\f1 go son of Bharbo. This I swear before 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he Mother of Mountains, as the stars look down in witness.\'94 \
His khalasar left Vaes Dothrak two days later, striking south and west ac
\f3 ross 
\f1 the plains. Khal Drogo led them on his great red stallion, with Daenerys beside him on her silver. The wineseller hurried behind them, naked, on foot, chained at throat and wrists. His chains were fastened to the halter of Dany\'92s silver. As she rode, he ran after her, barefoot and stumbling. No harm would come to him . . . so long as he kept up. \

CATELYN \
It was too far to make out the banners clearly, but even through the drifting fog she could see that they were white, with a dark smudge in their center that could only be the 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 irewolf of Stark, grey upon its icy field. When she saw it with her own eyes, Catelyn reined
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 up her horse and bowed her head in thanks. The gods were good. She was not too late. \
\'93They await our coming, my lady,\'94 Ser Wylis Manderly said, \'93as my lord father swore they would.\'94 \
\'93Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser.\'94 Ser Brynden Tully put the spurs to his horse and trotted briskly toward the banners. Catelyn rode beside him. \
Ser Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel followed, leading their levies, near fifteen hundred men: some twenty-odd knights and as many 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 quires, two hundred mounted lances, swordsmen, and freeriders, and the rest foot, armed with spears, pikes and tridents. Lord Wyman had remained behind to see to the defenses of White Harbor. A man of near sixty years, he had grown too stout to sit a horse. \'93If I had thought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels,\'94 he\'92d told Catelyn when he met her ship, slapping his massive belly with both hands. His fingers were fat as sausages. \'93My boys will see you safe to your son, though, have no f
\f3 ear.\'94 
\f1 \
His \'93boys\'94 were both older than Catelyn,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and she might have wished that they did not take after their father quite so closely. Ser Wylis was only a few eels short of not being able to mount his own horse; she pitied the poor animal. Ser Wendel, the younger boy, would have been the fattest man she\'92d ever known, had she only neglected to meet his father and brother. Wylis was quiet and formal, Wendel loud and boisterous; both had ostentatious walrus mustaches and heads as bare as a baby\'92s bottom; neither seemed to own a single garment that was not spotted with food stains. Yet 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he liked them well enough; they had gotten her to Robb, as their father had vowed, and nothing else mattere
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 . \
She was pleased to see that her son had sent eyes out, even to the east. The Lannisters would come from the south when they came, but it was good that Robb was being careful. My 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 on is leading a host to war, she thought, still only half believing it. She was desperately afraid for him, and for Winterfell, yet she could not deny feeling a certain \
pride as well. A year ago he had been a boy. What was he now? she wondered. \
Outriders spied the Manderly banners\'97the white merman with trident in hand, rising from a blue-green sea\'97and hailed them warmly. They were led to a spot of high groun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  dry enough for a camp. Ser Wylis called a halt there, and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father\'92s respects to their liege lord. \
The ground under their horses\'92 hooves was soft and wet. It fell away slowl
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  beneath them as they rode past smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-laden with hardbread and salt beef. On a stony outcrop of land higher than the surrounding country, they passed 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  lord\'92s pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth. Catelyn recognized the banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on its dark orange field. \
Just beyond, through the mists, she glimpsed the walls an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  towers of Moat Cailin . . . or what remained of them. Immense blocks of black basalt, each as large as a crofter\'92s cottage, lay scattered and tumbled like a child\'92s wooden blocks, half-sunk in the soft boggy soil. Nothing else remained of 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  curtain wall that had once stood as high as Winterfell\'92s. The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a thousand years past, with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood. All that was left of the great stronghold of the First Men were three towers . . . three where there had once been twenty, if the taletellers could be believed. \
The Gatehouse
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a few feet of standing wall to either side of it. The Drunkard\'92s Tower, off in the bog where the south and west walls had once met, leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter. And the tall, slender Children\'92s Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon their nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters, had lost half its crown. It looked as if some great beast had taken a bite out of the crenellations along the tower top, and spit the rubble across the bog. All three towers were green with moss. A tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower, it
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin. \
\'93Gods have mercy,\'94 Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them. \'93This is Moat Cailin? It\'92s no more than a\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97death trap,\'94 Catelyn finished. \'93I know how it looks, Uncle. I thought the same the first time I saw it, but Ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems. The three surviving towers command the causeway f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om all sides, and any enemy must pass between them. The bogs here are impenetrable, full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes. To assault any of the towers, an army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls s
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 imy with moss, \
all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers.\'94 She gave her un
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 le a grim smile. \'93And when night falls, there are
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood.\'94 \
Ser Brynden chuckled. \'93Remind me not to linger here. Last I looked, I was southron myself.\'94 \
Standards had been raised atop all three towers. The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard\'92s Tower, beneath the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 direwolf; on the Children\'92s Towe
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  it was th
\f3 e G
\f1 reatjon\'92s giant in shattered chains. But on the Gatehouse Tower, the Stark banner flew al
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne. That was where Robb had made his seat. Catelyn made for it, with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her, their horses stepping slowly down the log-and-plank road that had been laid acro
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 s the green-and-black fields of mud. \
She found her son surrounded by his father\'92s lords bannermen, in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth. He was seated at a massive stone table, a pile of maps and papers in front of him, talking intently with Roose Bolton and the Greatjon. At first he did not notice her . . . but his wolf did. The great grey beast was lying near the fire, but when Catelyn entered he lifted his head, and his gol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 en eyes met hers. The lords fell silent one by one, and Robb looked up at the sud
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 en quiet and saw her. \'93Mother?\'94 he said, his voice thick with emotion. \
Catelyn wanted to run to him, to kiss his sweet brow, to wrap him in her arms and hold him so tightly tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  he would never come to harm . . . but here in front of his lords, she dared not. He was playing a man\'92s part now, and she would not take that away
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 from him. So she held herself at the far end of the basalt slab they were using for a table. The direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where she stood. It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be. \'93You\'92ve grown a beard,\'94 she said t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  Robb, while Grey Wind sniffed her hand. \
He rubbed his stubbled jaw, suddenly awkward. \'93Yes.\'94 His chin hairs were redder than the ones on his head. \
\'93I like it.\'94 Catelyn stroked the wolfs head, gently. \'93It makes you look like my brother Edmure.\'94 Grey Wind nipped at her fingers, playful, and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 rotted back to his place by the fire. \
Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects, kneeling before her and pressing his brow to her hand. \'93Lady Catelyn,\'94 he said, \'93you are fair as ever, a welcome sight in troubled times.\'94 The Glovers followed, Galbart and Robett, and Greatjon Umber, and the rest, one by one. Theon Greyjoy was the last. \'93I had not looked to see you here, my lady,\'94 he sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d as he knelt. \
\'93I had not thought to be here,\'94 Catelyn said, \'93until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  called the banners. You know his son, Ser Wendel.\'94 Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow. \'93And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sister\'92s service for mine.\'94 \
\'93The Blackfish,\'94 Robb said. \'93Thank you for joining us, ser. We need men of your courage. And you, Ser Wendel, I am glad to have you here. Is Ser Rodrik w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th you as well, Mother? I\'92ve missed him.\'94 \
\'93Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor. I have named him castellan and commanded him to hold Winte
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 fell till our return. Maester Luwin is a wise cou
\f3 ns
\f1 ellor, but unskilled in the arts of war.\'94 \
\'93Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark,\'94 the Greatjon told her in his bass rumble. \'93Winterfell is safe. We\'92ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister\'92s bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it\'92s on to the Red Keep to free Ned.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93My lady, a question, as it please you.\'94 Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 dfort, had a small voice, yet when he spoke larger men quieted to listen. His eyes were curiously pale, almost without color, and his look disturbing. \'93It is said that you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hold Lord Tywin\'92s dwarf son as captive. Have you broug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t him to us? I vow, we should make good use of such a hostage.\'94 \
\'93I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer,\'94 Catelyn was forced to admit. A chorus of consternation greeted the news. \'93I was no more pleased than you, my lords. The gods saw fit to free him, with 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ome help from my fool of a sister.\'94 She ought not to be so open in her contempt, she knew, but her parting from the Eyri
\f3 e had
\f1  not been pleasant. She had offered to take Lord Robert with her, to foster him at Winterfell for a few years. The company of other boys would do him good, she had dared to suggest. Lysa\'92s rage had been frightening to behold. \'93Sister or no,\'94 she had replied, \'93if you try to steal my son, you will leave by the Moon Door.\'94 After that there was no more to be said. \
The lords were anxious to question her f
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rther, but Catelyn rai
\f3 sed a ha
\f1 nd. \'93No doubt we will have time for all this later, but my 
\f2\fs24 j
\f1\fs28 ourney has fatigued me. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, my lords.\'94 She gave them no choice; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood, the bannermen bowed and took their leave. \'93And you, Theon,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she added when Greyjoy lingered. He smiled and left them. \
There was ale and cheese on the table. Catelyn ti
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 led a horn, sat, sipped, and studied her son. He seemed taller than when she\'92d left, and the wisps of beard d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d make him look older. \'93Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers.\'94 \
\'93I will be sixteen soon enough,\'94 Robb said. \
\'93And you are fifteen now. Fifteen, and leading a host to battle. Can you understand why I might fear, Robb?\'94 \
His look grew stubborn. \'93There was no one else.\'94 \
\'93No one?\'94 she said. \'93Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago? Roose Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Helman Tallhart . . . you might have given the command to any of them. Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my choice.\'94 \
\'93They are not 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 tarks,\'94 he said. \
\'93They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle. You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past.\'94 \
She saw anger in his eyes at that, but it was gone as quick as it came, and suddenly he was a boy again. \'93I know,\'94 he said, abashed. \'93Are you . . . are you sending me back to Winterfell?\'94 \
Catelyn sighed. \'93I should. You ought never have left. Yet I dare not, not now. You have come too far. Someday these lords will look to you as their liege. If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper, they will remember, and laugh about it in their cups. The day will come when you need them to respect you, even fear you a little. Laughter is poison to fear. I will not do that to you, much as I might wish to keep you safe.\'94 \
\'93You have my thanks, Mother,\'94 
\f2\fs24 h
\f3\fs28 e said, his reli
\f1 ef obvious beneath the formality. \
She reached across his table and touched his hair. \'93You a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e my firstborn, Robb. I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 orld, red-faced and squalling.\'94 \
He rose, clearly uncomfortable with her touch, and walked to the hearth. Grey Wind rubbed his head against his leg. \'93You know . . . about Father?\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 The reports of Robert\'92s sudden death and Ned\'92s fall had frightened Catelyn more than she could say, but she would not let her son see her fear. \'93Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Ha
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 bor. Have you had any word of your sisters?\'94 \
\'93There was a letter,\'94 Robb said, scratching his direwolf under the jaw. \'93One for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine.\'94 He went to the table, rummaged among some maps and papers, and returned with a crumpled parchment. \'93This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bri
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g yours.\'94 \
Something in Robb\'92s tone troubled her. She smoothed out the paper and read. Concern gave way to disbelief, then to anger, and lastly to fear. \'93This is Cersei\'92s letter, not your 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ister\'92s,\'94 she said when she was done. \'93The real message is in what Sansa does not say. All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating her . . . I know the sound of a threat, even whispered. They have Sansa hostage, and they mean to keep her.\'94 \
\'93There\'92s no
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mention of Arya,\'94 Robb pointed out, miserable.\
\'93No.\'94 Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here. \
\'93I had hoped . . . if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostages . . . \'94 He took Sansa\'92s letter and crumpled it in his fist, and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time. \'93Is there word from the Eyrie? I wrote to Aunt Lysa, asking help. Has she called Lord Arryn\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  banners, do you know? Will the knights of the Vale come join us?\'94 \
\'93Only one,\'94 sh
\f3 e sai
\f1 d, \'93the best of them, my uncle . . . but Brynden
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Blackfish was a Tully first. My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.\'94 \
Robb took it hard. \'93Mother, what are we going to do? I brought this whole army together, eighteen thousand men, but I don\'92t . . . I\'92m not certain . . . \'94 He looked to her, his eyes shining, the proud young lord melted away in an instant, and quick as that he was a child again, a fifteen-year-old 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 y l
\f1 ooking to his mother for answers. \
It would not do.\
\'93What are you so afraid of, Robb?\'94 she asked gently. \
\'93I . . . \'94 He turned his head away, to hide the first tear. \'93If we march . . . even if we win . . . the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father. They\'92ll kill them, won\'92t they
\f3 ?\'94 \
\'93T
\f1 hey
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 want us to think so.\'94 \'93You mean they\'92re lying?\'94 \
\'93I do not know, Robb. What I do know is that you hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  no choice. If you go to King
\f3 \'92s L
\f1 anding and sw
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ar fealty, you will never be allowed to leave. If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell, your lords will lose all respect for you. Some may even go over to \
the Lannisters. Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do as she likes with her prisoners. Our best hope, our only true hope, is that you can defeat the foe in the field. If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of it. So long as you have power enough that they must fear you, Ned and your sister should be safe. Cersei is wise enough to 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 now that she may need them to make her peace, should the fighting go against her.\'94 \
\'93What if the fighting doesn\'92t go
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 against her?\'94 Robb asked. \'93What if it goes against us?\'94 \
Catelyn took his hand. \'93Robb, I will not soften the truth for you. If you lose, there is no hope for any of us. They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock. Remember the fate of Rhaegar\'92s children.\'94 \
She saw the fear in his young eyes then, but there was a strength as well. \'93Then I will not lose,\'94 he vowed. \
\'93Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands,\'94 she said. She had to learn if he was truly ready. \
\'93Less than a fortnight past, they 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,\'94 Robb said. \'93Uncle Edmure had sent Lo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d
\f3  Van
\f1 ce and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight. Lord Vance was slain. The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and his other bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on his heels. That\'92s not the
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 worst of it, thoug
\f1 h. All the time they were battling in the pass, Lord Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ound from the south. It\'92s said to be even larger than Jaime\'92s host. \
\'93Father must
\f3  have known that, bec
\f1 ause he sent ou
\f3 t some men to oppos
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28  them, under the king\'92s own banner. H
\f1 e gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and the letter said there were other kni
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hts as well, and a force of Father\'92s own guardsmen. Only it was a trap. Lord Derik had no sooner cr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ssed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king\'92s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer\'92s Ford. This Lord D
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain
\f3 , but Se
\f1 r Raymun was killed, and most o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  our men from Winterfell. Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it\'92s said, and now he\'92s marc
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ing north toward Harrenhal, burning as he goes.\'94 \
Grim and grimmer, thought Catelyn. It was worse than she\'92d imagined. \'93You mean to meet him here?\'94 she asked. \
\'93If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will,\'94 Robb said. \'93I\'92ve sent word to 
\f2\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 owland \
Reed, Father\'92s old friend at Greywater Watch. If 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them every step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord T
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 win is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees. He\'92ll stay close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castle
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  of the river lords one by one, until Riverrun stands alone. We need to march south to meet him.\'94 \
The very idea of it chilled Catelyn to the bone. What chance would a fifteen-year-old boy have against seasoned battle commanders like Jaime and Ty
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 in Lannister? \'93Is that wise? You are strongly placed here. It\'92s said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own.\'94 \
\'93Yes, but our food and supplies are runni
\f2\fs24 n
\f1 \cf3 g low, an\cf2 d \cf3 this is not land w\cf2 e \cf3 can l
\f2 \cf2 i
\f1 \cf3 ve off ea\cf2 si\cf3 ly. We\'92ve been wai\cf2 ti\cf3 ng fo
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38  Lord M
\f2\b0\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nderly, but now that his sons have joined us, we need to march.\'94 \
She was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with her son\'92s voice, she realized. Over the years, she had hosted many of them at Winterfell, and been welcomed with Ned to their o
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n hearths and tables. She kn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w what sorts of men they were, each one. She wondered if Robb did. \
And yet there was sense in what they said. This host her son had assembled was not a standing army such as the Free Cities were accustomed to maintain, nor a force of guardsmen paid in coin. Most of them were smallfolk: crofters, fieldhands, fishermen, sheepherders, the sons of innkeeps and traders and tanners, leavened with a smattering of sellswords and freeriders hungry for plunder. When their lords called, they \
came . . . but not forever. \'93Marching is all very well,\'94 she said to her son, \'93but where, and to what purpos
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ? What do you mean to do?\'94 \
Robb hesitated. \'93The Greatjon thinks we should
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him,\'94 he said, \'93but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we\'92d be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure a
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ainst the Kingslayer.\'94 He ran his fingers through his shaggy mane of auburn hair, looking unhappy. \'93Though by the t
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 me we reach Riverrun . . . I\'92m not certain . . . \'94 \
\'93Be certain,\'94 Catelyn told her son, \'93or go home and take up that wooden sword again. Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark. Make no mistake, Robb\'97these are your bannermen, not your friends. You named yourself battle commander. Command.\'94 \
Her son looked at her, startled, as if he could not credit what he was hearing. \'93As you say, Mother.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ll ask you again. What 
\f3 do y
\f1 ou mean to do?\'94 \
Robb drew a map across the tabl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , a ragged piece of old leather covered with lines of faded paint. One end curled up from being rolled; he weighed it down with his dagger. \'93Both plans have virtues
\f3 , but
\f1  . . . look, if we try to swing around Lord Tywin\'92s host, we take the risk of being caught between him and the Kingslayer, and if we attack him . . . by all r
\f3 eports, he
\f1  has more men
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 than I do, and a lot more armored horse. The Greatjon says that won\'92t matter if we catch him with his breeches down, but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannist
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r won\'92t be so easily surprised.\'94 \
\'93Good,\'94 she said. She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice, as he sat there, puzzling over the map. \'93Tell me more.\'94 \
\'93I\'92d leave a small force here to hold Moat C
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ilin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the causeway,\'94 he said, \'93but once we\'92re below the Neck, I\'92d split our host in two. The foot can continue down the kingsroad, while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins.\'94 He pointed. \'93When Lord Tywin gets word that we\'92ve come south, he\'92ll march north to engage our main host, leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to Riverrun.\'94 Robb sat back, not quite daring to smile, but pleased with himself and hungry for her praise. \
Catelyn frowned down at the map. \'93You\'92d put a river between the two parts of your army.\'94 \
\'93And between Jaime and Lord Tywin,\'94 he said eagerly. The smile came at last. \'93There\'92s no crossing on the Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won his crown. Not until the Twins,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 all the way up here, and Lord Frey controls that bridge. He\'92s your father\'92s bannerman, isn\'92t that so?\'94 \
The Late Lord Frey, Catelyn thought. \'93He is,\'94 she admitted, \'93but my father has never trusted him. Nor should you.\'94 \
\'93I won\'92t,\'94 Robb promised. \'93What do you think?\'94\
She was impressed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 despite herself. He looks like a Tully, she thought, yet he\'92s still his \
father\'92s son, and Ned taught him well. \'93Which force would you command?\'94\
\'93The horse,\'94 he answered at once. Again like his father; Ned would always take the more \
dangerous task himself. \'93And the other?\'94 \
\'93The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin. I thought I\'92d give him the honor.\'94 \
It was his first misstep, but how to make him see it without w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 unding his fledgling confidence? \'93Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known.\'94 \
Robb grinned. \'93Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he laughed about it. So you agree, then?\'94 \
\'93Your father is not fearless,\'94 Catelyn pointed out. \'93He is brave, but that is very different.\'94 \
Her son considered 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat for a moment. \'93The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and Winterfell,\'94 he said thoughtfully. \'93Well, them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat. So I don\'92t want someone fearless, do I?\'94 \
\'93No. You want cold cunning, I should think, not courage.\'94 \
\'93Roose Bolton,\'94 Robb said at once. \'93That man scares me.\'94 \
\'93Then let u
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well.\'94 \
Robb nodded and rolled up the map.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93I\'92ll give the commands, and assemble an escort to take you home to Winterfell.\'94 \
Catelyn had fought to keep herself strong, for Ned\'92s sake and for this stubborn brave son of theirs. She had put despair and fear aside, as if they were garments she did not choose to we
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r . . . but now she saw that she had donned them after all. \
\'93I am not going to Winterfell,\'94 she heard herself say, surprised at the sudden rush of tears that blurred her vision. \'93My father may 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 e dying behind the walls of Riverrun. My brother is surrounded by foes. I must go to them.\'94 \

TYRION \
Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears had gone ahead to scout, and it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was she who brought back word of the army at the crossroads. \'93By their fires I call them twenty thousand strong,\'94 she said. \'93Their banners are red, with a golden lion.\'94 \
\'93Your father?\'94 Br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 nn asked. \
\'93Or my brother Jaime,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93We shall know soon enough.\'94 He surveyed his ragged band of brigands: near three hundred Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just the seed of the army he hoped to grow. Gunthor son of Gurn was raising the other clans even now. He wondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen steel. If truth be told, he did not know\
what to make of them himself. Was he their comma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 der or their captive? Most of the time, it seemed to be a little of both. \'93It might be best if I rode down alone,\'94 he suggested. \
\'93Best for Tyrion son of Tywin,\'94 said Ulf, who spoke for the Moon Brothers. \
Shagga glowered, a fearsome sight to see. \'93Shagga son of Dolf likes this not. Shagga will go with the boyman, and if the boyman lies, Shagga will chop off his m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nhood\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97and feed it to the goats, yes,\'94 Tyrion said wearily. \'93Shagga, I give you my word as a Lannister, I will return.\'94 \
\'93Why should we trust your word?\'94 Chella was a small hard woman, flat as a boy, and no fool. \'93Lowland lords have lied to the clans before.\'94 \
\'93You wound me, Chella,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93Here I thought we had become such friends. But as you will. You shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and Timett son of Timett for the Burned Men.\'94 The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them. \'93The rest shall wait here until I send for you. Try not to kill a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d maim each other while I\'92m gone.\'94 \
He put his heels to his horse and trotted off, giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind. Either was fine with him, so long as they did not sit down to talk for a day and a night. That was the trouble with the clans; they had an absurd notion that every man\'92s voice should be heard in council, so they argued about everything, endless
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y. \
Even their women were allowed to speak. Small wonder that it had been hundreds of years since they last threaten
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the Vale with anything beyond an occasional raid. Tyrion meant to change that. \
Brorm rode with him. Behind them\'97after a q
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ick bit of grumbling\'97the five clansmen followed on their undersize garrons, scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats. \
The Stone
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Crows rode together, and Chell
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  and Ulf stayed close as well, as the Moon Brothers and Black Ears had strong bonds between them. Timett son of Timet
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  rode alone. Every clan in the Mountains of the Moon feared the Burned Men, who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and (the others said) roasted babies at their feasts. And even the other Burned Men feared Timett, who had put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when he reached the age of manhood. Tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple, a finger, or (if he was truly brave, or truly mad) an ear. Timett\'92s fellow Burned Men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him a red hand, which seemed to be some sort of a war chief. \
\'93I wonder what their king burned off,\'94 Tyrion said to Bronn when he heard the tale. Grinning, the sellsword had tugged at his crotch . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . but even Bronn kept a respectful tongue around Timett. If a man was mad enough to put out his own eye, he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies. \
Distant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party descended through the foothills, and once Tyrion saw a raven take wing. Where t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e high road twisted between two rocky outcrops, they came to the first strong point. A
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road, and a dozen crossbowmen manned the heights. Tyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the wall alone. \'93Who commands here?\'94 he shouted up. \
The captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lord\'92s son. They tr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 tted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts, down to the riverlands and the Green Fork of the Trident. Tyrion saw no bodies, but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows; there had been fighting here, and recently. \
Half a league from the crossroads, a barricade of sharpened stakes had been 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rected, manned by pikemen and archers. Behind the line, the camp spread out to the far distance. Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires, mail
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d men sat under trees and honed their blades, and familiar banners fluttered from st
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ffs thrust into the muddy ground. \
A party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they approached the \
stakes. The knight who
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 l
\f3 ed them wore
\f1  silver armor inlaid with amethysts and a striped purple-and-silver cloak. His shield bore a unicorn sigil, and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of his hor
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ehead helm. Tyrion reined up to greet him. \'93Se
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Flement.\'94 \
Ser Flement Brax lifted his visor. \'93Tyrion,\'94 he said in astonishment. \'93My lord, we all feared you dead, or . . . \'94 He looked at the clansmen uncertainly. \'93These . . . companions of yours . . . \'94 \
\'93Bosom friends and loyal retainers
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Tyrion said. \'93Where will I find my lord father?\'94 \'93He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters.\'94 \
Tyrion laughed. The inn at the crossroads! Perhaps the gods were just after all. \'93I will see him at once.\'94 \
\'93As you say
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  my lord.\'94 Ser Flement wheeled his horse about and shouted commands. Three rows of stakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the line. Tyrion led his party through. \
Lord Tywin\'92s camp spread over leagues. Chella\'92s estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far wrong. The common men camped out in the open, but the knights had thrown up tents, and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as large as houses. Tyrion spied the red o
\f2\fs24 x
\f1\fs28  of the Presters, Lord Crakehall\'92s brindled boar, the burning tree of Marbrand, the badger of Lydden. Knights called out to him as he cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment. \
Shagga was gaping back; beyond a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 certainty, he had never seen so many m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n, horses, and weapons in all his days. The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces, but T
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rion had no doubts that they were full as much in awe. Better and better. The more impressed they were with the power of the Lannisters, the easier they would be to command. \
The inn and its stables were much as he remembered, though little more than tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of the village had stood. A
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gibbet had been erected in the yard, and the body that swung there was covered with ravens. At Tyrion\'92s approach they t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ok to the air, squawking and flapping their black wings. He dismounted and glanced up at what remained of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  corpse. The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks, baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e. \'93A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked,\'94 he reminded her with a sigh of reproach. \
Boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses. Shagga did not want to give his up. \'93The lad won\'92t steal your mare,\'94 Tyrion assured him. \'93He only wants to give 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er some
\f3  oat
\f1 s and water and brush out her coat.\'94 Shagga\'92s coat could have used a good brushing too, but it would have been less than tactful to mention it. \'93You have my word, the horse will not be harmed.\'94 \
Glaring, Shagga let go his grip on the reins. \'93This is the horse of Shagga
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 son of Dolf,\'94 he roared at the stableboy. \
\'93If he doesn\'92t give her back, chop off his ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 hood 
\f3 and 
\f1 feed it to the goats,\'94 Tyrion promised. \'93Provided you can find some.\'94 \
A pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms stood under the inn\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sign, on either side of the door. Tyrion recognized their captain. \'93My father?\'94 \
\'93In the common room, m\'92lord.\'94 \
\'93My men will want meat and mead,\'94 Tyrion told him. \'93See that they g
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t it.\'94 He ente
\f3 red
\f1  the inn, and there was Father. \
Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, was in his middle fifties, yet hard as a man of twenty. Eve
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  seated, he was tall, with long legs, broad shoulders, a flat stomach. His thin arms were corded with muscle. When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, he had commanded his barber to shave his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures. He razored his lip and chin as well, but kept his side-whiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks from ear to jaw. His eye
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  were a pale green, flecked with gold. A fool more foolish than most had once jested that even Lord Tywin\'92s shit was flecked with gold. Some said the man was still alive, deep in the bowels of Casterly Rock. \
Ser Kevan Lannister, his father\'92s only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room. His uncle was portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of his massive jaw. Ser Kevan saw him first. \'93Tyrion,\'94 he said in surprise. \
\'93Uncle,\'94 Tyrion said, bowing. \'93And my lord father. What a pleasure to find you here.\'94 \
Lord Tywin did not stir from his chair, but he did give his dwarf son a long, se
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rching look. \'93I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded.\'94 \
\'93Sorry to disappoint you, Father,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93No need to leap up and embrace me, I wouldn\'92t want you to strain yourself.\'94 He crossed the room to their table, acutely \
conscious of the way his stunted legs made him waddle with every step. Whenever his father\'92s eyes were on him, he became uncomfortably aware of all his deformities and shortcomings. \'93Kind of you to go to war for me,\'94 he said as he climbed into a chair and helped himself to a cup of his father\'92s ale. \
\'93By my lights, it was you who started this,\'94 Lord Tywin replied. \'93Your brother J
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ands of a woman.\'94 \
\'93That\'92s one way we differ, Jaime and I. He\'92s taller as well, you may have noticed.\'94 \
His father
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ignored the sally. \'93The honor of our House was at st
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ke. I had no choice but to ride. No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity.\'94 \
\'93Hear Me Ro
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r,\'94 Tyrion said, grinning. The Lannister words. \'93Truth be told, none of my blood was actually sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, although it was a close thing once or twice. Morrec and Jyck were killed.\'94 \
\'93I suppose you will be wanting some new men.\'94 \
\'93Don\'92t tro
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ble yourself, Father, I\'92ve acquired a few of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 my own.\'94 He tried a swallow of the ale. It was brown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t. Very fine, in truth. A pity his father had hanged the innkeep. \'93How is your war going?\'94 \
His uncle answered. \'93Well enough, for the nonce. Ser Edmure had scattered small
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding, and your l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup.\'94 \
\'93Your brother has been cov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ring himself with glory,\'94 his father said. \'93He smashed the Lords Vance and Pi
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 er at the Golden Tooth, and met the massed power of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun. The lords of the Trident have been put to rout. Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive, with many of his knights and bannermen. Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun, where Jaime has them under siege. The rest fled to their own strongholds.\'94 \
\'93Your father and I have been marching on each in turn,\'94 Ser Kevan said. \'93With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want of men to defend it. Ser Gregor burnt out the Pipers and the Brackens . . . \'94 \
\'93Leaving you unopposed?\'94 Tyrion said. \
\'93Not wholly,\'94 Ser Kevan said. \'93The Mall
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 sters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins.\'94 \
\'93No matter,\'94 Lord Tywin said. \'93Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air, and 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll he smells now is ruin. And Jason Mallister lacks the strength to fight alone. 
\f2\fs24 O
\f1\fs28 nce Jaime takes Riverrun, they will both be quick enough to bend the knee. Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us, this war is good as won.\'94 \
\'93I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93The Starks are another matter. Lord Eddard\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97is our hostage,\'94 his father said. \'93He will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon un
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 er the Red Keep.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ser Kevan agreed, \'93but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host around him.\'94 \
\'93No sword is strong until it\'92s been tempered,\'94 Lord Tywin declared. \'93The Stark boy is a child. No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes down to butcher\'92s work. I doubt he has the stomach for it.\'94 \
Things had gotte
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  interesting while he\'92d been away, Tyrion reflected. \'93A
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this \'91butcher\'92s work\'92 is being done?\'94 he wondered. \'93How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f his dear friend Ned?\'94 \
\'93Robert Baratheon is dead,\'94 his father told him. \'93Your nephew reigns in King\'92s Landing.\'94 \
That did take Tyrion aback. \'93My sister, you mean.\'94 He took another gulp of ale. The realm would be a much different place with Cersei ruling in place of her husband. \
\'93If you have a mind to make yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rself of use, I will give you a command,\'94 his father said. \'93Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands across the Red Fork.\'94 \
Tyrion made a tsking
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sound. \'93The gall of them, fighting back. Ordinarily I\'92d be glad to punish such rudene
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 s, Father, but the truth is, I have pressing business elsewhere.\'94 \
\'93Do you?\'94 Lord Tywin did not seem awed. \'93We
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 also have a pair of Ned Stark\'92s afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties. Beric Dondarrio
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , some young lordli
\f3 ng w
\f1 ith delusions of valor. He has that fat jape of a priest with him, the one who likes to set his sword on fire. Do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off? Witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f3\fs28 t making too mu
\f1 ch a botch of it?\'94 \
Tyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled. \'93Father, it warms my heart to thi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 k that you might entrust me with . . . what, twenty men? Fifty? Are you sure you can spare so many? Well, no 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 atter. If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank them both.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  He climbed down from his chair and waddled to the sideboard, where a wheel of veined white cheese sat surrounded by fruit. \'93First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep,\'94 he said as he sliced off a wedge. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 I shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearhead
\f2\fs24 s
\f1 \cf3 , maces, \cf2 ba\cf3 ttleaxes, gauntlet\cf2 s,\cf3  gorg
\f2 \cf2 e
\f1 \cf3 ts, greav\cf2 es\cf3 , breastplates, wa\cf2 go\cf3 ns to
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 carry 
\f2\b0\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll this\'97\'94 \
The door behind him opened with a crash, so violently that Tyrion almost dropped his cheese. Ser Kevan leapt up swearing as the captain of the 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 uard went flying across the room to smash against the hearth. As he tumbled down into the cold ashes, his lion helm askew, Shagga snapped the man\'92s sword in two over a knee thick as a tree trunk, threw down the pieces, and lumbered into the common room. He was preceded by his stench, riper than the cheese and overpowering in the closed space. \'93Little redcape,\'94 he snarled, \'93w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire.\'94 \
\'93What, no goats?\'94 Tyrion said, taking a bite of cheese. \
The other clansmen followed Shagga into the common room, Bronn with them. The sellsword gave Tyrion a rueful shrug. \
\'93Who might you be?\'94 Lord Tywin asked, cool as snow. \
\'93They followed me home, Father,\'94 Tyrion explained. \'93May I keep them? They don\'92t eat much.\'94 \
No one was smiling. \'93By what right do you savages intrude on our councils?\'94 demanded Ser Kevan. \
\'93Savages, lowlander?\'94 Conn might have been handsome if you washed him. \'93We are free men, and free men by ri
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hts sit on all war councils.\'94 \
\'93Which one is the lion lord?\'94 Chella asked. \
\'93They are both old men,\'94 announced Timett son of Timett, who had yet to see his twentieth year. \
Ser Kevan\'92s hand went to his sword hilt, but his brother placed two fingers on his wrist and held him fast. Lord Tywin seemed unperturbed. \'93Tyrion, have you forgotten your \
courtesies? Kindly acquaint us with our . . . honored guests.\'94 \
Tyrion li
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ked his fingers. \'93With pleasure,\'94 he said. \'93The fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m no maid,\'94 Chella protested. \'93My sons have taken fifty ears among them.\'94 \
\'93May they take fifty more.\'94 Tyrion waddled away from
\f3  he
\f1 r. \'93This is Conn son of Coratt. Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair. They are Stone Crows. Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers, and here Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn, a sellswo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d of no particular allegiance. He has already changed sides twice in the short time I\'92ve known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father.\'94 To Bronn and the clansmen he said, \'93May I present my lord father, Tywin s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, and once and future Hand of the King.\'94 \
Lord Tywin rose, dignified and correct. \'93Even in the west, we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon. What brings you down from your strongholds, my lords?\'94 \
\'93Horses,\'94 said Shagga.\
\'93A promise of silk and steel,\'94 said Timett son of Timet
\f3 t. \
Tyrion was about
\f1  to tell his lord fa
\f3 ther how he proposed to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking wasteland, but he was never given the chance. 
\f1 Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  door banged open again. The messenger gave Tyrion\'92s clansmen a quick, queer look as he dropped to one knee before Lord Tywin. \'93My lord,\'94 he said, \'93Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway.\'94 \
Lord Tywin Lannister did not smile. Lord Tywin never smiled, but Tyrion had learned to read
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his father\'92s pleasure all the same, and it was there on his face. \'93So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions,\'94 he said in a voice of quiet satisfaction. \'93Splendid. Return to Ser Addam and tell him to fall back. He is not to engage the northerne
\f3 rs un
\f1 til we arrive, but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south.\'94 \
\'93It will be as you command.\'94 The rider took his leave. \
\'93We are well situated here,\'94 Ser Kevan pointed out. \'93Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes. If they are coming south, I say 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 et them come, and break themselves against us.\'94 \
\'93The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers,\'94 Lord Tywin replied. \'93The sooner the Starks are broken, the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon. Tell the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 drummers to beat assembly, and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark.\'94 \
\'93As you will,\'94 Ser Kevan said. \
Tyrion watched with a grim fascination as his lord father turned next to the half-wild clansmen. \'93It is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear.\'94 \
\'93It is said truly,\'94 Conn of the Stone Crows answered. \'93And the women,\'94 Chella added. \
\'93Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised you, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  more,\'94 Lord Tywin told them. \
\'93Would you pay us with our own coin?\'94 Ulf son of Umar said. \'93Why should we need the father\'92s promise, when we have the son\'92s?\'94 \
\'93I said nothing of need,\'94 Lord Tywin replied. \'93My words were courtesy, nothing more. You need not join us. The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice, and even my boldest knights fear to face them.\'94 \
Oh, deftly done, Tyrion thought, smiling crookedly.\
\'93The Burned Men fear nothing. Timett son of Timett will ride with the lions.\'94 \
\'93Wherever the Burned Men go, the Stone Crows have been there first,\'94 Conn declared hotly. \'93We ride as well.\'94 \
\'93
\f3 Shagga 
\f1 son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods 
\f3 and feed them to the crows.\'94 \
\'93We will ride with you, lion lor
\f1 d,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed, \'93but only if your halfman son goes with us. He has bought his breath with promises. Until we hold the steel he has pledged us, h
\f3 is l
\f1 ife is ours.\'94 \
Lord Tywin turned his gold-flecked eyes on his son. \'93Joy,\'94 Tyrion said with a resigned smile. \

SANSA \
The walls of the throne room had been stripped bare, the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap. \
Ser Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard. Sansa hovered by the door, for once unguarded. The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good, yet even so, she was escorted everywhere she went. \'93Hon
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r guards for my daughter-to-be,\'94 the queen called them, but they did not make Sansa feel honored. \
\'93Freedom of the castle\'94 meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls, a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give. She couldn\'92t have gone b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 yond the walls anyway. The gates were watched day and night by Janos Slynt\'92s gold cloaks, and Lannister
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 house guards were always about as well. Besides, even if she could leave the castle, where would she go? It was enough that she could walk in the yard, pick flowers in Myrcella\'92s garden, and visit the sept to pray for her father. Sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well, since the Starks kept the old gods. \
This was the first court session of Joffrey\'92s r
\f3 eign,
\f1  so Sansa looked about nervously. A line of Lannister house guards stood beneath the western windows, a line of gold-cloaked City Watchmen beneath t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e east. Of smallfolk and commoners, she saw no sign, but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly. There were no more than twenty, where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon King Robert. \
Sansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front. She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho, gloomy Ser Aron Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber . . . only none of them seemed to recognize her. Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the grey plague. Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when funny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her, Ser Balon Sw
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nn whispered in his ear and he turned away. \
And so many others were missing. Where had the rest of them gone? Sansa wondered. Vainly, she searched for friendly faces. Not one of them would meet her eyes. It was as if she had become a ghost, dead before her time. \
Grand Maeste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, se
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 mingly asleep, his hands clasped together atop his beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, his feet making no sound. A moment later Lord Baelish entered through the t
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ll doors in the rear, smiling. He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser D
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ntos as he made his way to the front. Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa\'92s stomach. I shouldn\'92t be afr
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id, she told herself. I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, Joff loves me and the queen does too, she said so. \
A herald\'92s voice rang out. \'93All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the Fir
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. All hail his lady mother, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent, Light of the West, and Protector of the Realm.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
Ser Barristan Selmy, resplendent in white plate, led them in. Ser Arys Oakheart escorted the queen, while Ser Boros Blount walked beside Joffrey, so six of the Kingsguard were now in the hall, all the White Swords save Jaime Lannister alone. Her pr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nce\'97no, her king now!\'97took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time, while his mother was seated with the council. Joff wore plush black velv
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ts slashed with crimson, a shimmering cloth- of-gold cape with a high collar, and on his head a golden crown crus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed with rubies and black diamonds. \
When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall, his eye caught Sansa\'92s. He smiled, seated himself, and spoke. \'93It is a king\'92s duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true. Grand Maester Pycelle, I command you to read my decrees.\'94 \
Pycelle pushed himself to his feet. He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet, with an ermine collar and shiny gold fastenings. From a drooping sleeve, heavy with gilded scrollwork, he drew a parchment, unrolled it, and began to read a long list of names, commanding each in the name of king and council to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey. Failing that, they would be adjudged traitors, their lands and titles forfeit to the throne. \
The names he read made Sansa hold
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her breath. Lord Stannis Baratheon, his lady wife, his daughter. Lord Renly Baratheon. Both Lord Royces and their sons. Ser Loras Tyrell. Lord Mac
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Tyrell, his brothers, uncles, sons. The red priest, Thoros of Myr. Lord Beric Dondarrion. Lady Lysa Arryn and her son, the little Lord Robert. Lord Hoster Tully
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  his brother Ser Brynden, his son Ser Edmure. Lord Jason Mallister. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Lord Tytos Blackwood. Lord Walder Frey and his heir Ser Stev
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 on. Lord Karyl Vance. Lord Jonos Bracken. Lady Sheila Whent. Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne, and all his sons. So many,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she thought as Pycelle read on and on, it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands. \
And at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark. Brandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present herse
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f and swear an oath . . . it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell by now . . . \
Grand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list, tucked it up his left sleeve, and pulled another parchment from his right. He cleared his throat and resumed. \'93In the place of the traitor Eddard 
\f3 Stark
\f1 , it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, take up the office of Hand of the Kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 , to speak with his voice, lead his armies against his 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nemies, and carry out his royal will. So the king has decreed. The small council consents. \
\'93In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, 
\f3 who has ever been his staunchest su
\f1 pport, be seated upon his small council, that she may help him rule wisely and with justice. So the king has decreed. The small council cons
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nts.\'94 \
Sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her, but it was quickly stilled. Pycelle continued. \
\'93It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of King\'92s Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time. It is moreover his command that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council, to assist in the governance of the realm. So the king has decreed. The small council consents.\'94 \
Sansa glim
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 sed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance. This time the muttering was louder and angrier. Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding, frog-faced commoner as he marched past. Golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together soft
\f3 ly 
\f1 with each step. His cloak was checked black-and-gold satin. Two ugly boys who must have been his son
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  went before him, struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were. For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear, gold on a n
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ght-black field. The sight of it raised go
\f3 ose prickles up an
\f1 d down Sansa\'92s arms. \
As Lord Slynt took his place, Grand Maester Pycelle resumed. \'93Las
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ly, in these times of treason and turmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of King Joffrey is of paramount 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 mportance . . . \'94 He looked to the queen. \
Cersei stood. \'93Ser Barristan Selmy, stand forth.\'94 \
Ser Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 rone, as still as any statue, but now
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he went to one knee and bowed his head. \'93Your Grace, I am yours to command.\'94 \
\'93Rise, Ser Barristan,\'94 Cersei Lannister said. \'93You may remove your helm.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 My lady?\'94 Standing, the old knight took off his h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 gh white helm, though he did not seem to understand why. \
\'93You have served the realm long and faithfully, good ser, and every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks. Yet now I fear your service is at an end. It is the wi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 h of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden.\'94 \
\'93My . . . burden? I fear I . . . I do not . . . \'94 \
The new-made lord, Janos Slynt, spoke up, his v
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ice heavy and blunt. \'93Her Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\'94 \
The tall, white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there, scarcely breathing. \'93Your Grace,\'94 he said at last. \'93The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood. Our vows are taken for life. Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust.\'94 \
\'93Whose death, Ser Barristan?\'94 The queen\'92s voice was soft as silk, but her words carried the whole length of the hall. \'93Yours, or your king\'92s?\'94 \
\'93You let my father d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 e,\'94 Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne. \'93You\'92re too old to protect anybody.\'94 \
Sansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king. She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had never seen 
\f3 him
\f1  look his years befo
\f3 re, yet now he did. \'93Your Grace,\'94 he s
\f1 aid. \'93I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year. It was all I had ever dreamed, from 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he moment I first took sword in hand. 
\f3 I gave up all claim to my ancestral k
\f1 eep. The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place, I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had no need of land or sons, my life would be lived for the realm. Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my vows . . . to ward the king with all my strength . . . to give my blo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 d for his . . . I fought beside the White Bull and Prince Lewy
\f3 n of Dorne . . . beside 
\f1 Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Before I served your father, I helped shield King Aerys, and his father Jaehaerys
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 before him . . . three \
kings . . . \'94\
\'93And all of 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem dead,\'94 Littlefinger pointed out.\
\'93Your time is done,\'94 Cersei Lannister announced. \'93Joffrey requires men around him \
who are young and strong. The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as the Lor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Commander of Sworn Brothers of the White Swords.\'94 \
\'93The Kingslayer,\'94 Ser Barristan said, his voice hard with contempt. \'93The false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend.\'94 \
\'93Have a care for your words, ser,\'94 the queen warned
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93You are speaking of our beloved brother, your king\'92s own blood.\'94 \
Lord Varys spoke, ge
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 tler than the others. \'93We are not unmindful of your service, good ser. Lord Tywin Lannister has
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of Lannisport, beside the sea, with gol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  and men sufficient to build you 
\f3 a stout keep, and servants to
\f1  see to your every need.\'94 \
Ser Barristan looked up sharply. \'93A hall to die in, and men to bury me. I thank 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou, my lords . . . but I spit upon your pity.\'94 He reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor. His helmet dropped with a clang. \'93I am a knight,\'94 he told 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem. He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well. \'93I shall die a knight.\'94 \
\'93A naked knight, it would seem,\'94 
\f2\fs24 q
\f1\fs28 uipped Littlefinger. \
They all laughed then, Joffrey on his throne, and the lords standing attendance, Janos Slynt and Queen Cersei and Sandor Clegane and even the other men of the Kingsguard, the five who had been his brothers until a moment ago
\f3 . Surely
\f1  that must have hurt the most, Sansa thou
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht. Her heart went out to the gallant old man as he stood shamed and red-faced, too angry to speak. Finally he drew his sword. \
Sansa heard someone gasp. Ser Boros and S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Meryn moved forward to confront him, but Ser Barristan froze them in place with a look that dripped contempt. \'93Have no fear, sers, your king is safe . . . no thanks to you. Even now, I could cut through the five of you as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 easy as a dagger cuts cheese. If you would serve under the Kingslayer, not a one of you is fit to wear the white.\'94 He flung 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is sword at the foot of the Iron Throne. \'93Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others, if you
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 like. It will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these five. Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne.\'94 \
He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 took the long way out, his steps rin
\f3 ging l
\f1 oud against the f
\f3 loor and echoing off the bare stone walls. Lords and ladies parted to let h
\f1 im pass. Not until the pages had closed the gre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t oak-and-bronze doors behind him did Sansa hear sounds again: soft voices, uneasy
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 stirrings, the shuffle of papers from the council table. \'93He called me boy,\'94 Joffrey said peevishly, sounding younger than his years. \'93He talked about my uncle Stannis too.\'94 \
\'93Idle talk,\'94 said Varys the eunuch. \'93Without meaning . . . \'94\
\'93He could be making plots with my uncles.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 I want him seized and questioned.\'94 No one \
moved. Joffrey r
\f2\fs24 a
\f1 \cf3 ised his \cf2 vo\cf3 ice. \'93I said, I wa\cf2 nt\cf3  him 
\f2 \cf2 s
\f1 \cf3 eized!\'94\
\cf2 Ja\cf3 nos Slynt rose fro\cf2 m \cf3 the c
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38 uncil t
\f2\b0\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ble. \'93My gold cloaks will see to it, Your Grace.\'94 \
\'93Good,\'94 said King Joffrey. Lord Janos strode from the hall, his ugly sons double- stepping to keep up as they lugged the great metal shield with the arms of House Slynt. \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Littlefinger reminded the king. \'93If we might resume, the seven are now six. We find ourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard.\'94 \
Joffrey smiled. \'93Tell them, Mo
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her.\'94 \
\'93The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.\'94 \
\'93How do you like that, dog?\'94 King Joffrey asked. \
The Hound\'92s scarred face was hard to read. He took a
\f3  long moment 
\f1 to consider. \'93Why n
\f3 ot? I have no lands nor wif
\f1 e to forsake, and who\'92d care if I did?\'94 The burned
\f3  side of his 
\f1 mouth twisted. \'93But I
\f3  warn you, I\'92ll say no
\f1  k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ight\'92s vows.\'94 \
\'93The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights,\'94 Ser Boros said firmly. \'93Until now,\'94 the Hound said in his deep rasp, and Ser Boros fell silent. \
When the king\'92s herald moved forward
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Sansa realized the moment was almost at hand. She smoothed down the cloth of her skirt nervously. She was dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead king, but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful. Her gown was t
\f3 he i
\f1 vory silk that the queen had given her, the one Arya had 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 uined, but she\'92d had them dye it black and you couldn\'92t see the stain at all. She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain. \
The herald\'92s voice boomed out. \'93If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  speak now or go forth and hold his silence.\'94 \
Sansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then another. Lords and knights step
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ed aside silently to let her pass, and she \
felt the weight of their eyes on her. I must be as strong as my lady mother. \'93Your Grace,\'94 she called out in a soft, tremulous voice. \
The height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall. He was the first to see her. \'93Come forward, my lady,\'94 he called out, smiling. \
His smile emboldened her, made her feel beautiful and strong. He
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 does love me, he does. Sansa lifted her head and walked toward him, not too slow and not too fast. She must not let them see how nervous she was. \
\'93The Lady Sansa, of House Stark,\'94 the herald cried. \
She stopped under the throne, at the spot where Ser Barrista
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 \'92s white cloak lay puddled on the floor beside his helm and breastplate. \'93Do you have some business for king and council, Sansa?\'94 the queen asked from the council table. \
\'93I do.\'94 She knelt on the cloak, so as not to spoil her gown, and looked up at her prince on his fearsome black throne. \'93As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was the Hand of the King.\'94 She had practiced the words a hundred times. \
The queen sighed. \'93Sansa, you disappoint me. What did I tell you about traitor\'92s blood?\'94 \
\'93Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes, my lady,\'94 Grand Maester Pycelle intoned. \
\'93Ah, poor sad thing,\'94 sighed Varys. \'93She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is only a babe, my lords, she does not know what she asks.\'94 \
Sansa had eyes only for Joffrey. He must listen to me, he must, she thought. The king shifted on his seat, \'93Let her speak,\'94 he commanded. \'93I want to hear what she says.\'94 \
\'93Thank you, Your Grace.\'94 Sansa smiled, a shy secret smile, just for him. He was listening. She knew he would. \
\'93Treason is a noxious weed,\'94 Pycelle declared solemnly. \'93It must be torn up, root and stem and
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 seed, lest n
\f1 ew traitors sprout from every roadside.\'94 \
\'93Do you 
\f3 deny your father\'92s crime?\'94 Lord Baelish asked.\
\'93
\f1 No
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  my lords.\'94 Sansa knew better than that. \'93I know he must be punished. All I ask is \
mercy. I know my lord father must regret what he did. He was King Robert\'92s friend and he loved him, you all know he loved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or . . . or somebody, they must have lied, otherwise . . . \'94 \
King Joffrey 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eaned forward, hands grasping the arms of the throne. Broken sword points fanned out between his fingers. \'93He said I wasn\'92t the king. Why did he say that?\'94 \
\'93His leg was broken,\'94 Sansa replied eagerly. \'93It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ds. Otherwise he would never have said it.\'94 \
Varys said, \'93A child\'92s faith . . . such sweet innocence . . . and yet, they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.\'94 \
\'93Treason is treason,\'94 Pycelle replied at once. Joffrey rocked restlessly on the throne. \'93Mother?\'94 \
Cersei Lannister consi
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ered Sansa thoughtfully. \'93If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime,\'94 she said at last, \'93we would know he had repented his folly.\'94 \
Joffrey pushed himself to his feet. Please
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Sansa 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hought, please, please, be the king I know you are, good and kind and noble, please. \'93Do you have any more to say?\'94 he asked her. \
\'93Only . . . that as you love me, you do me this kindness, my prince,\'94 Sansa said. \
King Joff
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ey looked her up and down. \'93Your sweet words have moved me,\'94 he said gallantly, nodding, as if to say all would be well. \'93I shall do as you ask . . . but first your father has to confess. He has to confess and say that I\'92m the king, or there will be no mercy for him.\'94 \
\'93He will,\'94 Sansa said, heart soaring. \'93Oh, I know he will.\'94 \

EDDARD \
The straw on the floor stank of urine. There was no window, no bed, not even a slop bucket. He remembered walls of pale red stone festooned with patches of nitre, a grey door of splintered wood, four inches thick and studded with iron. He had seen them, briefly, a quick glimpse as they shoved him inside. Once the door had slammed shut, he had seen no more. The dark was absolute. He had as well been blind. \
Or dead. Buried with his king. \'93Ah, Robert,\'94 he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone wall, h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s leg throbbing with every motion. He remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of Winterfell, as the Kings of Winter looked on with cold stone eyes. The king eats, Robert had said, and the Hand takes the shit. How he had laughed. Yet he had gotten it wrong. The king dies, Ned Stark thought, and the Hand is buried. \
The dungeon was under the Red Keep, deeper than he dared imagine. He remembered the old st
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ries about Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle, so they might never reveal its secrets. \
He damned them all: Littlefinger, Janos Slynt and his gold cloaks, the queen, the Kingslayer, Pycelle and Varys and Ser Barristan, even Lord Renly, Robert\'92s own blood, who had run when he was needed most. Yet in the end he blamed himself. \'93Fool,\'94 he cried to the darkness, \'93thrice-damned blind fool.\'94 \
Cer
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ei Lannister\'92s face seemed to float before him in the darkness. Her hair was full of sunlight, but there was mockery in her smile. \'93When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,\'94 she whispered. Ned had played and lost, and his men had paid the
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 price of h
\f1 is folly with their life\'92s blood. \
When he thought of his daughters, he would have wept gladly,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 but the tears would not come. Even now, he was a Stark of Winterfell, and his 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 rief and his rage froze hard inside him. \
When he kept very still, his leg did not hurt so much, so he did his best to lie unmoving. For how long he could not say. There was no sun and no moon. He could not see to mark the walls. Ned closed his eyes and opened them; it made no difference. He slept and woke and slept again. He did not know which was more painful, the waking or the sleeping. When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing dreams of blood and broken \
promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but think, and his waking thoughts were worse than nightmares. The thought of Cat was as painful as a bed of nettl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s. He wondered where she was, what she was doing. He wondered whether he would ever see her again. \
Hours turned to days, or so it seemed. He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg, an itch beneath the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 plaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was hot to his fingers. The only sound was his breathing. After a time, he began to talk aloud, just to hear a voice. He made plans to keep himself sane, built castles o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  hope in the dark. Robert\'92s brothers were out in the world, raising armies at D
\f3 ragons
\f1 tone and Storm\'92s End. Alyn and Harwin would return to King\'92s Landing with the rest of his household guard once they had dealt with Ser Gregor. Catelyn would raise the north when the word reached her, and the lords of river and mountain and Vale would join her. \
He found himself thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as he had been in the flower
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of his youth, tall and handsome, his great antlered helm on his head, his warhammer in hand, sitting his horse like a horned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 god. He heard his laughter in the dark, saw his eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes. \'93Look at us, Ned,\'94 Robert said. \'93Gods, how did we come to this? You here, and me killed by a pig. We won a throne together . . . \'94 \
I failed you, Robert, Ned thought. He could not say the words. I lied to you, 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 id the truth. I let them kill you. \
The king heard him. \'93You stiff-necked fool,\'94 he mutt
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red, \'93too proud to listen. Can you eat pride, Stark? Will honor shield your children?\'94 Cracks ran down his 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace, fissures opening 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the flesh, and he reached up and ripped the mask away. It was not Robert at all; it was Littlefinger, grinning, mocking him. When he opened his mouth to speak, his lies turn
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d to pale grey moths and took wing. \
Ned was half-asleep when the footsteps came down the hall. At first he thought he dreamt them; it had been so long since he had heard anything but the sound of his own voice. Ned was feverish by then, his leg a dull agony, his lips parched and c
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 acked. When the heavy wooden door creaked open, the sudden light was painful to his eyes. \
A gaoler thrust a jug at him. The clay was cool and beaded with mois
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ure. 
\f3 Ned gr
\f1 asped it with both hands and gulped eagerly. Water ran from his mouth and dripped down through his beard. He drank until he thought he would be sick. \'93How long . . . 
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28 \'94 he asked weakly when he could drink no more. \
The gaoler was a scarecrow of a man with a rat\'92s face and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 frayed beard, clad in a mail shirt and a 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eather half cape. \'93No talking,\'94 he said as he wrenched the jug from Ned\'92s \
hands. \
\'93Please,\'94 Ned said, \'93my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 daughters . . . \'94 The door crashed shut. He blinked as the light vanished, lowered his head to his chest, and curled up on the straw. It no longer stank of urine and shit. It no longer smelled at all. \
He could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping. The memory came creeping upon him in the darkness, as vivid as a dream. It was the year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down from the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal. He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen on the wind. Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered Brandon\'92s laughter, and Robert\'92s berserk valor in the melee, the way h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  laughed as he unhorsed men left and right. He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king\'92s pavilion and making his vows
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to protect and defe
\f3 nd Ki
\f1 ng Aerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent helped Jaime to his feet, and the W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ite Bull himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders. All six White Swords were there to welcome their newest brother. \
Yet
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The crown prince wore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of sca
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 let silk streamed behind him when he rode, and it 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 eemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. \
Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion\'92s crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Pri
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ce Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse p
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 st his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty\'92s laurel in Lyanna\'92s lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost. \
Ned Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden. He felt them clawing at his skin, sharp and cruel, saw the slow trickle of blood run down his fingers, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 woke, trembling, in the dark. \
Promise me, Ned, his sister had whispered from her bed of blood. She had loved the scent of winter roses. \
\'93Gods save me,\'94 Ned wept. \'93I am going mad.\'94 The gods did not deign to answer. \
Each time the turnkey brought him water, he told himself another day had passed. At first he would beg the man for some word of his daughters and 
\f3 the w
\f1 orl
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  beyond his cell. Grunts and kicks were his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 only replies. Later, when the stomach cramps began, he begged for food instead. It made no matter; he was not fed. Perhaps the Lannisters meant for him to starve to death. \'93No,\'94 he told himself. If Cersei had wanted him dead, he would have been cut down in the throne room with his men. She wanted him alive. Weak, desperate, yet alive. Catelyn held her brother; she dare not kill him or the Imp\'92s life would be forfeit as well. \
From outside his cell came t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e rattle of iron chains. As the door cre
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ked open, Ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed himself toward the light. The glare of a torch made him squint. \'93Foo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 he croaked. \
\'93Wine,\'94 a voice an
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 wered. It was not the rat-faced man; this gaoler was stouter, shorter, though he wore the same leather half cape and spiked steel cap. \'93Drink, Lord Eddard.\'94 He thrust a wineskin into Ned\'92s hands. \
The voice was strangely familiar, yet it took Ned Stark a moment to place it. \'93Varys?\'94 he said groggily when it came. He touched the man\'92s face. \'93I\'92m not . . . not dreaming this. You\'92re here.\'94 The eunuch\'92s plump ch
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 eks were covered with a dark stubble of 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 eard. Ned felt the coarse hair with his fingers. Varys had transformed himself into a grizzled turnkey, reeking of sweat and sour wine. \'93How did you . . . what sort of magician are you?\'94 \
\'93A thirsty one,\'94 Varys said. \'93Drink, my lord.\'94\
Ned\'92s hands fumbled at the skin. \'93Is this the same poison they gave Robert?\'94 \
\'93You wrong me,\'94 Varys said sadly. \'93Truly, no one loves a eunuch. Give me the skin.\'94 He drank, a trickle of red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth. \'93Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney, but no more poisonous than most,\'94 he concluded, wiping his lips. \'93Here.\'94 \
Ned tried a swallow. \'93Dregs.\'94 He felt as though he were about to bring the wine back up. \
\'93All men must swallow the sour with the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 sweet. High lords and eunuchs alike. Your hour has come, my lord.\'94 \
\'93My daughters . . . \'94 \
\'93The younger girl e
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 caped 
\f3 Ser
\f1  Meryn and fled,\'94 Varys told him. \'93I have not been able to find her. Nor have the Lannisters. A kindness, there. Our new king loves her not. Your \
older girl is still betrothed to Joffrey. Cersei keeps her close. She came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared. A pity you couldn\'92t have been there, you would have been touched.\'94 He leaned forward intently.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93I trust you rea
\f3 lize t
\f1 hat you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?\'94 \
\'93The queen will not kill me,\'94 Ned said. His head swam; the wine was st
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ong, and it had been too long since he\'92d eaten. \'93Cat . . . Cat holds her brother . . . \'94 \
\'93The wrong brother,\'94 Varys sighed. \'93And lost to her, in any case. She let the Imp slip through her fingers. I expect he is dead by now, somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon.\'94 \
\'93If that is true, slit my throat and have done with it.\'94 He was dizzy from the wine, tired and heartsick. \
\'93Your blood is the last thing I desire.\'94 \
Ned frowned. \'93When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen and watched, and said not a word.\'94 \
\'93And would again. I seem to re
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 all that I was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister swords.\'94 The eunuch looked at him curiously, tilting his head. \'93When I was a young boy, before I was cut, I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities. They taught me that each man has a role to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 play, in life as well as mummery. So it is at court. The King\'92s Justice must be fearsome, the master of c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 in must be frugal, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiant . . . and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple. A courageous informer would be as useless as
\f3  a cowa
\f1 rdly knight.\'94 He took the wineskin back and drank. \
Ned stud
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed the eunuch\'92s face, searching for truth beneath the mummer\'92s scars and false stubble. He tried s
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 me more wine. This time it went down easier. \'93Can you free me from this pit?\'94 \
\'93I could . . . but will I? No. Questions would be asked, and the answers would lead back to me.\'94 \
Ned had expected no more. \'93You are blunt.\'94\
\'93A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, my lord.\'94 \'93Would you at least consent to carry a message out for
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me?\'94 \
\'93That would depend on the message. I will gladly provide you with paper and ink, if you like. And whe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  you have written what you will, I will take the letter and read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my own ends.\'94 \
\'93Your own en
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s. What ends are those, Lord Varys?\'94 \
\'93Peace,\'94 Varys replied without hesitation. \'93If there was one soul in Kin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 \'92
\f3 s 
\f1 Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.\'94 He sighed. \'93For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies, but I could not pro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ect him from his friends. What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey\'92s birth?\'94 \
\'93The madness of mercy,\'94 Ned admitted. \
\'93Ah,\'94 said Varys. \'93To be sure. You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard. Ofttimes I forget that. I have met so few of them in my life.\'94 He glanced around the cell. \'93When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand why.\'94 \
Ned Stark laid his head back against the damp stone wall and closed his eyes. His leg was throbbing. \'93The king\'92s wine . . . did you question Lancel?\'94 \
\'93Oh, indeed. Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Robert\'92s favorite vintage.\'94 The eunuch shrugged. \'93A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray . . . the forest is the abbatoir of the gods. It was not wine that killed the king. It was your mercy.\'94 \
Ned had feared as much. \'93Gods forgi
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 e me.\'94 \
\'93If there are gods,\'94 Varys
\f3  said, \'93I
\f1  expect 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1 \cf3 hey will.\cf2  T\cf3 he queen would not\cf2  h\cf3 ave w
\f2 \cf2 a
\f1 \cf3 ited long\cf2  i\cf3 n any case. Robert\cf2  w\cf3 as be
\f2 \cf2 c
\f0\b\fs38 oming un
\f2\b0\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 uly, and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers. They are quite a pair, Stannis and Renly. The iron gauntlet and the silk glove.\'94 He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \'93You have been foolish, my lord. You ought to have heeded Littlefinger when he urged you to support Joffrey\'92s succession.\'94 \
\'93How . . . how could you know of that?\'94 \
Varys sm
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 led. \'93I know, that\'92s all that need concern you. I also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit.\'94 \
Slowly Ned raised his eyes. \'93Why?\'94 \
\'93Cersei is frightened of you, my lord . . . but she has other enemies she fears even more. Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now. Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between her an
\f3 d the queen. In Dorne, the Martells 
\f1 still brood on the m
\f3 urder of Princess Elia and her babes. And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.\'94 \
\'93Robb is only a boy,\'94 Ned 
\f1 sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d, aghast. \
\'93A boy with an army,\'94 Varys said. \'93Yet only a boy, as you say. The king\'92s brothers are the ones giving Cersei sleepless nights . . . Lord Stannis in particular. His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth ha
\f3 lf so terrifying as a truly jus
\f1 t man. No one knows what Stannis h
\f3 as been doing on Dragonston
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , but I will wager you that he\'92s gathered more swords than seashells. So here is Cersei\'92s nightmare: while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim himself king, and lop off her son\'92s curly blond head . . . and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares more about the boy.\'94 \
\'93Stannis Baratheon is Robert\'92s tr
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 e heir,\'94 Ned said. \'93The throne is his by rights. I would welcome his ascent.\'94 \
Varys tsked. \'93Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you. Stannis may win the throne, but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unle
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 s you guard that tongue of yours. Sansa begged so sweetly, it would be a shame if you threw it all away. You are being given your life back, if you\'92ll take it. Cersei
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one.\'94 \
\'93You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my men, and crippled my son?\'94 Ned\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 voice was thick with disbelief. \
\'93I want you to serve the realm,\'94 Varys said. \'93Tell the queen that you wil
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  confess your vile treason, comm
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd your son to lay down his sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers. Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor. If you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 take the black
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s.\'94 \
The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep for words. If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him . . . pain shot through his broken 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 eg, beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast. He winced, his fingers opening and closing \
helplessly. \'93Is t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is your own scheme,\'94 he gasped out at Varys, \'93or are you 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n league with Littlefinger?\'94 \
That seemed to amuse the eunuch. \'93I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor. Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms. Oh, I feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that he thinks I am his . . . just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers.\'94 \
\'93And just as you let me believe that you were mine. Tell me, Lord Varys, who do you truly serve?\'94 \
Varys smiled thinly. \'93Why, the realm, my good lord, how ever could you doubt that? I swear it by my lost manhood. I serve the realm, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the realm needs peace.\'94 He finished the last swallow of wine, and tossed the empty skin aside. \'93So what is your answer, Lord Eddard? Give me your word that you\'92ll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.\'94 \
\'93If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor. My life
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is not so precious to me as that.\'94 \
\'93Pity.\'94 The eunuch stood. \'93And your daughter\'92s life, my lord? How precious is that?\'94 A chill pierced Ned\'92s heart. \'93My daughter . . . \'94 \
\'93Surely you d
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d not think I\'92d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my lord? The queen most certainly has not.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Ned pleaded, his voice cracking. \'93Varys, gods have mercy, do as you lik
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  with me, but leave my daughter out of your schemes. Sansa\'92s no more than a child.\'94 \
\'93Rhaenys was a child too. Prince Rhaegar\'92s daughter. A precious little thing, younger than your girls. She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know? I always wondered
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 what happened to him. Rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters tau
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 door.\'94 Varys gave a long weary sigh, the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack upon his 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 houlders. \'93The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. If that\'92s true, Lord Edda
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d, tell me . . . why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones? Pond
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r i
\f3 t, if
\f1  you would, while you wait upon the queen. And spare a thought for this as well: The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your pain . . . or he could bring you Sansa\'92s head. \
\'93The choice, my dear lord Han
\f3 d, 
\f1 is entirely yours.\'94 \

CATELYN \
As the host trooped down the causeway through the black bogs of the Neck and spilled out into the riverlands beyond, Catelyn\'92s apprehensions grew. She masked 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er fears behind a face kept still and stern, yet they were there all the same, growing with every league they crossed. Her days were anxious, her nights restless
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth. \
She feared for her lord father, and wondered at his ominous silence. She feared for her brother Edmure, and prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the Kings
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ayer in battle. She feared for Ned and her girls, and f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r the sweet sons she had left behind at Winterfell. And yet there was nothing she could do for any of them, and so she made herself put all thought of them aside. You must save your strength for Robb, she told herself. He is the only one you can hel
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 . You must be as fierce and hard as the north, Catelyn Tully. You must be a Stark for true now, like your son. \
Robb rode at the front of the column, beneath the flapping white banner of Winterfell. Each day he would ask one of his lords to join him, so they might confer as they marched; 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e honored every man in turn, showing no favorites, listenin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  as his lord father had listened, weighing the words of one against the other. He has learned so much from Ned, she thought as she watched him, but ha
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  he learned enough? \
The Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to sc
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 een their movements and scout the way. The reports Ser Brynden\'92s riders brought back did little to reassure her. Lord Tywin\'92s host was still many days to the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 south . . . but Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork. \
\'93Late again,\'94 Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all over, damn th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, yet here he sat. \
\'93Four thousand men,\'94 Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. \'93Lord Frey cann
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means to join his power to ours.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Does he?\'94 Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard sprea
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  out behind them, a slow-
\f3 movi
\f1 ng forest of \
lances and banners and spears. \'93I wonder. Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ill never be surprised.\'94 \
\'93He\'92s your father\'92s bannerman.\'94 \
\'93Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb. And Lord Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister\'92s sister. That means little of itself
\f3 , to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many
\f1  children over
\f3  the years, and they must needs 
\f1 marry someone. \
Still . . . \'94 \
\'93Do 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ou think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Robett Glover asked gravely. \
Catelyn sighed. \'93If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey inte
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ds to do. He has an old man\'92s caution and a young man\'92s ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.\'94 \
\'93We must have the Twins, Mother,\'94 Robb said heatedly. \'93There is no other way across the river. You know that.\'94 \
\'93Yes. And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that.\'94 \
That night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs, halfway between the kingsroad and the river. It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle. \'93Ser Brynden says to tell you he\'92s crossed swords with the Lannisters. There are a dozen scouts who won\'92t 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 e reporting back to Lord Tywin anytime soon. Or ever.\'94 He grinned. \'93Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and he\'92s pulling back south, burning as he goes. He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split.\'94 \
\'93Unless Lord Frey tells him,\'94 Catelyn said sharply. \'93Theon, when you return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with orders to 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ring down any raven they see leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my son\'92s movements to Lord Tywin.\'94 \
\'93Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,\'94 Theon replied with a cocky smile. \'93A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie. I\'92ll 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ave you their feathers for a hat.\'94 \
She ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her. \'93What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fiel
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 s and plunder their holdfasts?\'94 \
\'93There\'92s been some fighting between Ser Addam\'92s men and Lord Walder\'92s,\'94 Theon answered. \'93Not a day\'92s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up. Most of Lord Walder\'92s strength remains massed a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  the Twins, though.\'94 \
That bore Walder Frey\'92s seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold back, wait, watch, take no risk unless forced to it. \
\'93If he\'92s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows,\'94 Robb said. \
Catelyn was less encouraged. \'93Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin quite another.\'94 \
Robb turned back to Theon Greyjoy. \'93Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork?\'94 \
Theon shook his head. \'93The river\'92s running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can\'92t be forded, not this
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 far north.\'94 \
\'93I must have that crossing!\'94 Robb declared, fuming. \'93Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on thei
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  backs. We\'92d need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don\'92t have the trees for that. Or the time. Lord Tywin is marching north . . . \'94 He balled his hand into a fist. \
\'93Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,\'94 Theon Greyjoy said with his cus
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 omary easy confidence. \'93We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.\'94 \
\'93Not easily,\'94 Catelyn warned them, \'93and not in t
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 me. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rear.\'94 \
Robb glanced from her to Greyjoy, searching for an answer and finding none. For a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years, desp
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 te his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks. \'93What would
\f3  my 
\f1 lord father do?\'94 he asked her. \
\'93Find a way across,\'94 sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  told him. \'93Whatever it took.\'94 \
The next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them. He had put a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ide the heavy plate and helm he\'92d worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather- and-mail of an outrider, but his obsidian fish still fastened his cloak. \
Her uncle\'92s face was grave as he swung down off 
\f3 his horse
\f1 . \'93There has been a 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 attle under the walls of Riverrun,\'94 he said, his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mouth grim. \'93We had it from a Lannister outrider w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  took captive. The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure\'92s host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight.\'94 \
A cold hand clutched at Catelyn\'92
\f3 s heart. \'93And my brother?\'94 \
\'93W
\f1 ounded and taken prisoner,\'94 Ser Brynden said. \'93Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime\'92s host.\'94 \
Robb looked fretful. \'93We must get across this accursed river if we\'92re to have any hope of relieving them in time.\'94 \
\'93That will not be easily done,\'94 he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  uncle cautioned. \'93Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred.\'94 \
\'93Damn the man,\'94 Robb swore. \'93If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, he\'92ll leave me no choice but to storm his walls. I\'92ll pul
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  the Twins down aro
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 nd his ears if I have to, we\'92ll see how well he likes that!\'94 \
\'93You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,\'94 Catelyn said sharply. \'93A child sees an obstacle, and his first thou
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht is to run around it or knock it down. A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.\'94 \
Robb\'92s neck reddened at the rebuke. \'93Tell me what you mean, Mother,\'94 he said meekly. \
\'93The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll.\'94 \
\'93What toll? What does he want?\'94\
She smiled. \'93That is what we must discover.\'94 \'93And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in\
battle . . . or grow wings. I see no other choices.\'94 Catelyn put her heels to her horse and rode off, leaving her son to ponder her words. It would not do t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  make him feel as if his mother were usurping his place. Did you teach him wisdom as w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll as valor, Ned? she wondered. Did you teach him how to kneel? The graveyards of the Seven Kingdoms \
were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson. \
It was near midday when their vanguard came 
\f3 in 
\f1 sig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t of the Twins, where the Lords of the Crossing had their seat. \
The Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross. Their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide enough for two wagons to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pass abreast; the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding both road and river with its 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rrow slits,
\f3  mu
\f1 rder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three generations to complete their bridge; wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n they were done they\'92d thrown up stout timber keeps on either bank, so no one might cross wi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hout their leave. \
The timber had long since given way to stone. The Twins\'97two squat, ugly, formidable castles, identical in every respect, with the bridge arching between\'97had guarded the crossing for centuries. High curtain walls, deep moats, and heavy oak-and-iron gates protected the approaches, the bridge footings rose from within stout inner keeps, there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank, and the Water Tower defended th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  span itself. \
One glance was sufficient to tell Catelyn that the castle would not be tak
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n by storm. The battlements bristled with spears and swords and scorpions, there was an archer at every crenel and arrow slit, the drawbridge was up, the portcullis down, the gates closed and barred. \
The Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them. Lord Rickard Karstark glowered in silence. \'93That cannot be assaulted, my lords,\'94 Roose Bolton announced. \
\'93Nor can we take it by siege, witho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t an army on the far bank to invest the other castle,\'94 Helman Tallhart said gloomily. Across the deep-running green waters, the western twin stood like a refl
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ction of its eastern brother. \'93Even if we had the time. Which, to be sure, we do not.\'94 \
As the northern lords studie
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge slid across the moat, and a dozen knights rode forth to confront them, led by four of Lord Walder\'92s many sons. Their 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 nne
\f1 r bore twin towers, dark blue on a field of pale silver-grey. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder\'92s heir, spoke for them. The Freys all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, looked like an especially old and tired weasel, yet he was polite enough. \'93My lord father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.\'94 \
\'93I do.\'94 Robb spurred his horse forward. He was 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n his armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to his saddle and Grey Wind pa
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ding by his side. \
The old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his watery grey eyes, though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf. \'93My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here.\'94 \
His words crashed among the lords bannermen li
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e a great stone from a catapult. Not one of them approved. They cursed, argued, shouted down each other. \
\'93You must not do this, my lord,\'94 Galbart Glover pleaded with Robb. \'93Lord Walder is not to be trusted.\'94 \
Roose Bolton nodded. \'93Go in there alo
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e and you\'92re his. He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.\'94 \
\'93If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will all share his meat and mead,\'94 declared Ser Wendel Manderly. 
\f3 \
\'93
\f1 Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and ou
\f3 rs,
\f1 \'94 suggested his brother, Ser Wylis. \
Catelyn Stark shared all their doubts, but she had only to glance at Ser Stevron to see that he was not pleased by what he was hearing. A few more words and the chance would be lost. She had to act, and quickly. \'93
\f3 I w
\f1 ill go,\'94 she said loudly. \
\'93You, my lady?\'94 The Greatjon furrowed his br
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 w. \
\'93Mother, are you certain?\'94 Clearly, Robb was not. \

\f3 \'93Neve
\f1 r more,\'94 Catelyn lied glibly. \'93Lord Walder is my father\'92s bannerman. I have known him since I was a girl. He would never offer me any harm.\'94 Unless he saw some prof
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t in it, she added silently, but some truths did not bear saying, and some lies were necessary. \
\'93I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Cately
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 Ser Stevron said. \'93To vouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you.\'94 \
\'93He shall be our honored guest,\'94 said Robb. Ser Perwyn, the youngest of the four Freys in the party, dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother. \'93I require my lady mother\'92s return by evenfall, Ser Stevron,\'94 Robb went on. \'93It is not my intent to \
linger here long
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
Ser Stevron Frey gave a polite nod. \'93As you say, my 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ord.\'94 Catelyn spurred her horse forward and did not look back. Lord Walder\'92s sons and envoys fell in around her. \
Her father had once said of Walder Frey that he was the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches. When the Lord of the Crossing welcomed Catelyn in the great hall
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of the east castle, surrounded by twe
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ty living sons (minus Ser Perwyn, who would have made twenty-one), thirty-six grandsons, nineteen great-grandsons, and numerous d
\f3 aught
\f1 ers, granddaughters, bastards, and grandbastards, she understood just what he had meant. \
Lord Walder was ninety, a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head, too 
\f3 gout
\f1 y to stand unassisted. Hi
\f3 s n
\f1 ewest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked beside his litter when they carried him in. She was 
\f3 the 
\f1 eighth Lady Frey. \
\'93It is a great pleasure to s
\f3 ee yo
\f1 u again after so many years, my lord,\'94 Catelyn said. \
The old man squinted at her suspicious
\f3 ly. 
\f1 \'93Is it? I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 doubt that. Spare me your sweet words, Lady Catelyn, I am too old. Why are you here? Is your boy too proud to come before me himself? What am I to do with you?\'94 \
Catelyn had been a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 girl the last time she had visited the Twins, but even then Lord Walder had been irascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner. Age had made him worse than ever, it would seem. She would need to choose her words with care, and do her best to take no offense
\f3  fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  his. \
\'93Father,\'94 Ser Stevron said reproachfully, \'93you forget yourself. Lady Stark is h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re at your invitation.\'94 \
\'93Did I ask you? You are not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead? I\'92ll hear no instructions from you.\'94 \
\'93This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest, Father,\'94 one of his younger sons said. \
\'93Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy,\'94 Lord Walder complained. \'93I\'92ll speak any way I like, damn you. I\'92ve had three kings to guest in my life, and queens as well, do you think I require lessons from the likes of you, Ryger? Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed.\'94 He dismissed the red-faced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons. \'93Danwell, Whalen, help me to my chair.\'94 \
They shifted Lord Walder from his litter and carried him to the high seat of the Freys, a \
ta
\f3 ll chai
\f1 r of black oak whose back was 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 arved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge. His young wife crept up timidly and covered his legs with a blanket. When he was settled, the old man beckoned Catelyn forward and planted a papery dry kiss on her hand. \'93There,\'94 he announced. \'93Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. Why are you here?\'94 \
\'93To ask you to open your gates, my lord,\'94 Catelyn replied politely. \'93My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way.\'94 \
\'93To Riverrun?\'94 He sniggered. \'93Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I\'92m not blind yet. The old man can still read a map.\'94 \
\'93To Riverrun,\'94 Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. \'93Where I might have expected to find you, my lord. You are still my father\'92s bannerman, are you n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t?\'94 \
\'93Heh,\'94 said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt. \'93I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the walls. It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled. Well, to send my sons. I am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn.\'94 He looked around for likely confirmation a
\f3 nd 
\f1 pointed to a tall, stooped man of fifty years. \'93Tell her, Jared. Tell her that was my intent.\'94 \
\'93It was, my lady,\'94 said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second wife. \'93On my honor.\'94 \
\'93Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?\'94 He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her, as if challenging her to dispute his version of events. \'93I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. Why should my boys hurry south to die? All those who did go south are running north again.\'94 \
Catelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roast
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d him over a fire, but she had only till evenfall to open the bridge. Calmly, she said, \'93All the more reason that we 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ust reach Riverrun, and soon. Where can we go to talk, my lord?\'94 \
\'93We\'92re talking now,\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Lord Frey complained. The spotted pink head snapped around. \'93What are you all looking at?\'94 he shouted at his kin. \'93Get out of here. Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private. Might be she has designs on my fidelity, heh. Go, all of you, find something useful to do. Yes, you too, woman. Out, out, out.\'94 As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall, he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed, \'93They\'92re all waiting for me to die. 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 tevron\'92s been waiting for forty years, but I keep disappointing him. Heh. Why should I die just so he can be a lord? I ask you. I won\'92t do it.\'94 \
\'93I have every hope tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  you will live to be a hundred.\'94\
\'93That would boil them, to be sure. Oh, to be sure. Now, what do you want to sa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 \'93We wa
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t to cross,\'94 Catelyn told him.\
\'93Oh, do you? That\'92s blunt. Why should I let you?\'94 \
For a moment her anger flared. \'93If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 r walls.\'94 \
\'93They\'92ll be twen
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 y thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,\'94 the old man shot back. \'93Don\'92t you try and frighten me, my lady. Your husband\'92s in some traitor\'92s cell under the Red Keep, your father\'92s sick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister\'92s got your brother in chains. What do you have that I should fear? That son of yours? I\'92ll match you son for son, and I\'92ll still have eighteen when yours are all dead.\'94 \
\'93You swore an oath to my father,\'94 Catelyn rem
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nded him. \
He bobbed his head side to side, smiling. \'93Oh, yes, I said some words, but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me. Joffrey\'92s the king now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels. If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I\'92d help the Lannisters boil you all.\'94 \
\'93Why don\'92t you?\'94 she challenged him. \
Lord Walder snorted with disdain. \'93Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that one is, him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there. I\'92ll wager you, he eats too many beans,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he breaks wind just like me, but you\'92ll never hear him
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 admit it, oh, no. What\'92s he got to be so puffed up about anyway? Only two sons, and one of them\'92s a twisted little monster. I\'92ll match him son for son, and I\'92ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!\'94 He cackled. \'93If Lord Tywin wants my help, he can bloody well ask for it.\'94 \
That was all Catelyn needed to hear. \'93I am asking fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  your help, my lord,\'94 she said humbly. \'93And my father and my bro
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice.\'94 \
Lord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face. \'93Save your sweet words, my lady. Sweet words I get
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 from my wife. Did you see her? Sixteen she is, a little
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 flower, and her honey\'92s only for me. I wager she gives me a son by this time next year. Perhaps I\'92ll make him \
heir, wouldn\'92t that boil the rest of them?\'94 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 I\'92m certain she will give you many sons.\'94 \
His head bob
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ed up and down. \'93Your lord father did not come to the wedding. An insult, as I see it. Even if he is dying. He never came to my last wedding either. He calls me the Late Lord Frey, you know. Does he think I\'92m dead? I\'92m 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ot dead, and I promise you, I\'92ll outlive him as I outlived his father. Your family has always pissed on me,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 don\'92t deny it, don\'92t lie, you know it\'92s true. Years ago, I went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter. Why not? I had a daughter in mind, sweet girl, only a few yea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s older than Edmure, but if your brother didn\'92t warm to her, I had others he might have had, young ones, old ones, virgins, widows, whatever he wanted. No, Lord Hoster would not hear of it. Sweet words he gave me, excuses, but what I wanted was to get rid of a daughter. \
\'93And your sister, that
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 one, she\'92s full as bad. It was, oh, a year ago, no more, Jon Arryn was still the King\'92s Hand, and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney. Stevron and Jared are t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 o old for the lists now, but Danwell and Hosteen rode, Perwyn as well, and a couple of my bastards tried the melee. If I\'92d known how they\'92d shame me, I would never have troubled myself to make the journey. Why did I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp? I ask you. The boy\'92s half his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 age, Ser Daisy they call him, something like that. And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight! Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine. My third wife was a Crakehall, all of the Crakehall women are sluts. Well, never mind about that, she died before you were born, what do
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 you care? \
\'93I was speaking of your sister. I 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1 \cf3 roposed t\cf2 ha\cf3 t Lord and Lady Ar\cf2 ry\cf3 n fos
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3 er two of\cf2  m\cf3 y grandsons at cou\cf2 rt\cf3 , and
\f2 \cf2  
\f0\b\fs38 offe
\f2\b0\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed to take their own son to ward here at the Twins. 
\f3 Are 
\f1 my grandsons unworthy to
\f3  be 
\f1 seen at the king\'92s court? They are sweet boys, quiet and mannerly. Walder is Merrett\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  son, named after me, and the other one . . . heh, I don\'92t recall . . . he might have been another Walder, they\'92re always naming them Walder so I\'92ll favor them, but his father . . . which one was his father now?\'94 His face wrinkled up. \'93Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn\'92t have him, or the ot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er one, and I blame your lady sister for that. She frosted up as if I\'92d suggested selling her boy to a mummer\'92s show or making a eunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis Baratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies. What good are apologies? I ask you.\'94 \
Catelyn frowned, disquieted. \'93I had understood that Lysa\'92s boy was to be foster
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d with Lord Tywin at Casterly Rock.\'94 \
\'93No, it was Lord Stannis,\'94 Walder Frey sai
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  irritably. \'93Do you think I can\'92t tell Lord \
Stannis from Lord Tywin? They\'92re both bungholes who think they\'92re too noble to shit, but never mind about that, I know the difference. Or do you think I\'92m so old I can\'92t remember? I\'92m ninety and I remember very well. I remember what to do with a woman too. That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year, I\'92ll wager. Or a daughter, that can\'92t be helped. Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like as not she\'92ll want to name it Walder or Walda.\'94 \
Catelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child. \'93Jon Arryn 
\f3 was 
\f1 go
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng to foster his son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?\'94 \
\'93Yes, yes, yes,\'94 the old man said. \'93Only he died
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  so what does it matter? You say you want to cross the river?\'94 \
\'93We do.\'94 \
\'93Well, you can\'92t!\'94 Lord Walder announced crisply. \'93Not unless I allow it, and why s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ould I? The Tullys and the Starks have never been friends of mine.\'94 He pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms, smirking, waiting for her answer. \
The rest was only 
\f3 haggling.
\f1  \
A swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened. The drawbridge creaked down, the portcullis winched up, and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen. Behind her came Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, and Lord Walder\'92s bastard son Ronel Rivers
\f2\fs24 ,
\f3\fs28  leading a long 
\f1 column of pikemen, rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks. \
Robb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his stallion. \'93It\'92s done,\'94 she told him. \'93Lord Walder will grant yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  
\f3 your c
\f1 rossing. His swords are yours as well, less four hundred he means to keep back to hol
\f3 d the 
\f1 Twi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 s. I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of archers and swordsmen. He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison . . . but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust. Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.\'94 \
\'93As you say, Mother,\'94 Robb answered, gazing at the ranks of pikemen. \'93Perhaps . . . Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?\'94 \
\'93A fine choice.\'94\
\'93What . . . what did he want of us?\'94 \
\'93If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey\'92s grandsons north to Winterfell,\'94 she told him. \'93I have agreed to take them as wards. They are young boys, aged eight years and seven. It would seem they are both named Walder. Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age, I should think.\'94 \
\'93Is that all? Two fosterlings? That\'92s a small enough price to\'97\'94 \
\'93Lord Frey\'92s son Olyvar will be coming with us,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  she went on. \'93He is to serv
\f3 e as your personal
\f1  sq
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ire. His father would like to see him knighted, in good time.\'94 \
\'93A squire.\'94 He shrugged. \'93Fine, that\'92s fine, if he\'92s\'97\'94 \
\'93Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder\'92s youngest son, 
\f2\fs24 E
\f1\fs28 lmar, when the two of them come of age.\'94 \
Robb looked nonplussed. \'93Arya won\'92t like that one bit.\'94 \
\'93And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,\'94 she finished. \'93His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer. He has a number he thinks might be suitable.\'94 \
To his credit, Robb did not flinch. \'93I see.\'94 \'93Do you consent?\'94\
\'93Can I ref
\f2\fs24 u
\f3\fs28 se?\'94\
\'93Not if
\f1  yo
\f3 u wish to cros
\f1 s.\'94
\f3  \
\'93I consent,\'94 Robb sai
\f1 d solemnly. He had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment. Boys might play with swords, but it took a lord to make a marriage pact, knowing what it meant. \
They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard, into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank. \
Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle Ser Brynden and Ser S
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 vron
\f1  Frey. Behind followed nin
\f3 e tenths o
\f1 f their horse; knights, lancers, freeriders, \
and mounted bowmen. It took hours for th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m all to cross. Afterward, Catelyn would remember 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge, the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass, the glitter of eyes peering down throug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the Water Tower. \
The larger part of the northern host, pikes and archers and great masses o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  men-at-arms on foot, remained upon the east bank under the command of Roose Bolton. Robb had commanded him to continue the march south, to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin. \
For good or ill, her son had thrown the dice. \

JON \
Are you well, 
\f3 Snow?\'94 Lord Morm
\f1 ont asked, scowling.\
\'93Well,\'94 his raven squawk
\f3 ed. \'93
\f1 Well.\'94\
\'93I am, my lord,\'94 Jon lied . . .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 loudly, as if that could make it true. \'93And you?\'94 \
Mormont frowned. \'93A dead man tried to ki
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l me. How well could I be?\'94 He scratched under his chin. His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and he\'92d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy. \'93You do not look well. How is your hand?\'94 \
\'93Healing.\'94 Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he\'92d felt nothing; the agony had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers, big as roaches. \'93The maester says I\'92ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before.\'94 \
\'93A scarred hand is nothing. On the Wall, you\'92ll be wearing gloves often as not.\'94 \
\'93As you say, my lord.\'94 It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t. Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous. At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame, burning day and night. Only plunging it into basins of snow and sh
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 ved ice gave any relief at all.
\f1  Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed, whimpering from the pain. And when at last he did sleep, he dr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 amt, and that was even worse. In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his father\'92s face, but he dared not tell Mormont that. \
\'93Dywen and Hake returned last night,\'94 the Old Bear said. \'93They found no sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.\'94 \
\'93I know.\'94 Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, and the failure of the rangers\'92 search had been all the men had been talking of. \
\'93You know,\'94 Mormont grumbled. \'93How is it that eve
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 yone knows everything around here?\'94 He did not seem to expect an answer. \'93It would seem there were only the two of . . . of those creatures, whatever they were, I will not call them men. And thank the gods for that. Any more and . . . well, that doesn\'92t bear thinking of. There will be more, though. I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon agrees. The cold winds are rising. Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen.\'94 \
Winter is 
\f3 coming. The Stark words had never s
\f1 ou
\f3 nded so grim or omi
\f1 nous to Jon as they did now. \'93My lord,\'94 he asked hesitantly, \'93it\'92s said there was a bird last night . . . \'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93There was. Wha
\f3 t of 
\f1 it?\'94\
\'93I had hoped for some word of my father.\'94 \
\'93Father,\'94 taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont\'92s shoulders. \'93Father.\'94 \
The Lord Commander reach
\f3 ed up 
\f1 to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his 
\f3 head, flut
\f1 tered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window. \'93Grief and noise,\'94 Mormont grumbled. \'93That\'92s all they\'92re good for, ravens. Why
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 I
\f3  put up 
\f1 with that pestilential bird . . 
\f3 . if the
\f1 re 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as news of Lord Eddard, don\'92t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you\'92re still his blood. The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy. It seems he\'92s been removed from the Kingsguard. They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now Selmy\'92s wanted for treason. The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he slew two of them and escaped.\'94 Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men who\'92d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold. \'93We have whi
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,\'94 he said in disgust. \
The raven laughed shrilly. \'93Boy, boy, boy, boy.\'94 \
Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear\'92s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, wh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t chance was there that Mormont\'92s letter would be heeded? He curled his hand into a fist. Pain shot through his burned fingers. \'93What of my sisters?\'94 \
\'93The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.\'94 He gave an irritated shrug. \'93Perhaps they nev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r got my letter. Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did not deign to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 reply. It would not be the first time, nor the last. I fear we count for less than nothing in King\'92s Landing. They tell us what they want us to know, and that\'92s little enough
\f2\fs24 .
\f3\fs28 \'94 \
And you tell me
\f1  what you want me to know, and that\'92s less, 
\f3 Jon thought resentfully. His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet
\f1  no word of that had been breathed to him . . . save by Samwell Tarly, who\'92d read the letter 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all the time saying how he shouldn\'92t.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Doubtless they thought his brother\'92s war was none of his concern. It troubled him more
\f3  tha
\f1 n he could say. Robb 
\f3 was 
\f1 mar
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hing and he was not. No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven. \
\'93Corn,\'94 the raven was crying. \'93Corn, corn.\'94\
\'93Oh, be quiet,\'94 the Old Bear told it. \'93
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 now, how soon does Maester Aemon say you\'92ll \
have use of that hand back?\'94 \'93Soon,\'94 Jon replied. \
\'93Good.\'94 On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver. \'93Here. You\'92ll be ready for this, then.\'94 \
The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutti
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g toward the sword, head cocked curiously
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Jon hesitated. He had no inkling what this meant. \'93My lord?\'94 \
\'93The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip. Well, dry leather and old woo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , what could you expect? The blade, now . . . you
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 d need a fire a hundred time
\f3 s as 
\f1 hot to harm the blade.\'94 Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks. \'93I had the rest made anew. Take it.\'94 \
\'93Take it,\'94 echoed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his raven, preening. \'93Take it, take it.\'94\
Awkwar
\f3 dly, 
\f1 Jon took the sword in hand. His left hand; his bandaged right was still too \
raw and clumsy. Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes. \
The pomme
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  
\f3 was 
\f1 a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e long blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf\'92s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two- handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a \'93bastard sword.\'94 Yet the wolf swor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. \'93This is Val
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 rian steel, my lord,\'94 he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel. \
\'93It is,\'94 the Old Bear told him. \'93It was my father\'92s swor
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 , and his father
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.\'94 \
He is giving me his son\'92s sword. Jon could scarcely believe
\f3  it
\f1 . The blade was exquisitely balanced. The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light. \'93Your son\'97\'94 \
\'93My son brought dishonor to Hou
\f3 se Mo
\f1 rmont, but at least he had the grace to leave
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the sword behind when he fled. My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah\'92s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber. The original pommel was a bear\'92s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable. For you, I thought a white wolf more apt. One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.\'94 \
When Jon had been Bran\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\'92s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even then he had known it was only a child\'92s folly; no bastard could ever hope t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  wield a father\'92s swo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 d. Even the memory shamed him. What kind of man stole his own brother\'92s birthright? I have no right to this, he thought, no more than to Ice. He twitched his burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep unde
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  the skin. \'93My lord, you honor me, but\'97\'94 \
\'93Spa
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e me your but\'92s, boy,\'94 Lord Mormont interrupted. \'93I would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours. You fought bravely . . . and more
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to the point, you thought quickly. Fire! Yes, damn it. We ought to have known. We ought to have remembered. The Long Night has come before. Oh, eight thousand
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 years
\f3  is a
\f1  good while, to be sure . . . yet if the Night\'92s Watc
\f3 h doe
\f1 s not 
\f3 remem
\f1 ber, w
\f3 ho wi
\f1 ll?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93Who will,\'94 chimed the talkative raven. \'93Who will.\'94 \
Truly, the gods had heard Jon\'92s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man\'92s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the face t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath. \
W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 atever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone. Yet in his nightmare he faced it again . . . and this time the burning corpse wore \
Lord Eddard\'92s features. It was his father\'92s skin that burst and blackened, his fa
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her\'92s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears. Jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say. \
\'93A sword\'92s small payment for a life,\'94 Mormont concluded. \'93Take it, I\'92ll hear no more of it, is that understood?\'94 \
\'93Yes, my lord.\'94 The soft leather gave beneath Jon\'92s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already. He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet . . . \
He is not my father. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\'92s mind. Lord Eddard Stark 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me. Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man\'92s sword he dreamt of . . . \
\'93I want no courtesies either,\'94 Mormont said, \'93so thank me no thanks. Honor the steel with deeds, not words.\'94 \
Jon nodded. \'93Does it have a name, my lord?\'94 \'93It did, once. Longclaw, it was called.\'94 \'93Claw,\'94 the raven cried. \'93Claw.\'94 \
\'93Longclaw is an apt name.\'94 Jon tried a practice cut. He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of its own. \'93Wolves have claws, as much as bears.\'94 \
The Old Bear seemed pleased by that. \'93I suppose they do. You\'92ll want to wear that over the shoulder, I imagine. It\'92s too long for the hip, at least until you\'92ve put on a few inches. And you\'92ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well. Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.\'94 \
\'93Ser 
\f2\fs24 E
\f1\fs28 ndrew?\'94 Jon did not know the name. \
\'93Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man. He\'92s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of master-at-arms. Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\'94 \
Jon lowered the sword. \'93Why?\'94 he said, stupidly. \
Mormont snorted. \'93Because I sent him, why do you think? He\'92s bringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowe
\f3 rs\'92s wrist. I ha
\f1 ve commanded h
\f3 im to take ship to \
King\'92s Landing and lay it before this boy king. That sh
\f1 ou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d get young Joffrey\'92s attention, I\'92d think . . . and Ser Alliser\'92s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.\'94 \
\'93Crow.\'94 Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant. \
\'93As well,\'94 the Lord Commander continued, ignoring
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the bird\'92s protest, \'93it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.\'94 He jabbed a finger up at Jon\'92s face. \'93And don\'92t think this means I approve of that nonsense in the common hall. Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but you\'92re not a boy anymore, however many years you\'92ve seen. That\'92s a man\'92s sword you have there, and it will
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 take a man to wield her. I\'92ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.\'94 \
\'93Yes, my lord.\'94 Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard. If not the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d freeing him from Alliser Thorne\'92s malignance was nobler still. \
The Old Bear
\f3  scr
\f1 atched at his chin. \'93I had forgotten how m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ch a n
\f3 ew be
\f1 ard itches,\'94 he said. \'93Well, no help for that. Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?\'94 \
\'93Yes, my lord.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93Good. The night will be cold, I\'92ll want hot spice wine. Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don\'92t skimp on the spices. And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton agai
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  I\'92m like to boil him. That last haunch was grey. Even the bird wouldn\'92t touch it.\'94 He stroked the raven\'92s head with his thumb, and the bird made a contented quorking sound. \'93Away with you. I\'92ve work to do.\'94 \
The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand. \'93Sweet steel,\'94 one man said. \'93You earned that, Snow,\'94 another told him. Jon made himself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it. He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it. His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was angry with or why. \
A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King\'92s Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence. They\'92d hung a target on the granary doors, so they coul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  seem to be honing their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them. No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called out, \'93Well, come about, let\'92s have a look.\'94 \
\'93At what?\'94 Jon said. \
Toad sidled close. \'93Your rosy butt che
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ks, what else?\'94 \'93The sword,\'94 Grenn stated. \'93We want to see the sword.\'94 Jon raked them with an accusing look. \'93You knew.\'94\
Pyp grinned. \'93We\'92re not all as dumb as Grenn.\'94 \
\'93You are so,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  insisted Grenn. \'93You\'92re dumber.\'94 \
Halder gave an apologetic shrug. \'93I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,\'94 the builder said, \'93and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole\'92s Town.\'94 \
\'93We knew even before that, though,\'94 Grenn said. \'93Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge. He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.\'94 \
\'93The sword!\'94 Matt insisted. The others took up the chant. \'93The sword, the sword, the sw
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rd.\'94 \
Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it. The bastard 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 lade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly. \'93Valyrian steel,\'94 he declared solemnly, tr
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ing to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt. \
\'93I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,\'94 declared Toad. \'93He cut his head off trying t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  shave.\'94 \
Py
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  grinned. \'93The Night\'92s Wat
\f3 ch i
\f1 s thousands of years old,\'94 he said, \'93but I\'92ll wager Lord Snow\'92s the first brother ever ho
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ored for burning down the Lord Commander\'92s Tower.\'94 \
The others laughed, and even Jon had to smile. The fire he\'92d started had not, in truth, burned do
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n that formidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two fl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ors, where the Old Bear had his chambers. No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor\'92s murderous corpse. \
The other wight, the one-handed thin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers, had also been destroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords . . . but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men. Ser Jaremy had finish
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it 
\f3 in his bowels. Strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead; ev
\f1 en arms and armor offered small protection. \
That grim thought soured Jon\'92s fragile mood. \'93I need to see Hobb
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 about the Old Bear\'92s supper,\'94 he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard. His friends meant well, but they did not understand. It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers. Nor did they know of the fighting in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  riverlands. How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and strode off, sullen. Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind. \
They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin\'92s Tower after the fire, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d it was there he returned. Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon\'92s boots. The direwolf\'92s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men. Jon knelt, scratched his ear, and showed him the pommel of the sword. \'93Look. It\'92s you.\'94 \
Ghost sniffed 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t his carved stone likeness and tried a lick. Jon smiled. \'93You\'92re the one deserves an honor,\'94 he told the wolf . . . and suddenly he found himself remembering how he\'92d found him, that day in the late summer snow. The
\f3 y had
\f1  been riding off with 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and turned back, and there he was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts. He was all alone, he thought, apart from the others in the litter. He was different, so they drove him out. \
\'93Jon?\'94 He looked up. Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels. His cheeks were red, and 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation. \
\'93Sam.\'94 Jon stood. \'93What is it? Do you want to see the sword?\'94 If the others had known, no doubt Sam did too. \
The fat boy shook his head. \'93I was heir to 
\f3 my f
\f1 ather\'92s blade once,\'94 he said mourn
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ully. \'93Heartsbane. Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always scared me. It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I\'92d hurt one of my sisters. Dickon will have it now.\'94 He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak. \'93I a
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  . . . Maester Aemon wants to see 
\f3 you.\'94 
\f1 \
It was not time for his bandages to be changed. Jon frowned suspiciously. \'93Why?\'94 he demanded. Sam looked miserable. That was answer enough. \'93You told him, didn\'92t you?\'94 Jon said angrily. \'93You told him that you told me.\'94 \
\'93I . . . he . . . Jon, I didn\'92t want to . . . he asked . . . I mean I think he knew, he sees things no one else sees . . . \'94 \
\'93He\'92s blind,\'94 Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted. \'93I can find the way mys
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lf.\'94 He left Sam standing there, openmouthed and quivering. \
He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery, feeding the ravens. Clydas was with him, carrying a bucket 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f cho
\f3 pped m
\f1 eat as they shuffled from cage to cage. \'93Sam said you wanted me?\'94 \
The maester n
\f3 odded. 
\f1 \'93I did i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 deed. Clydas, give Jon the bucket. Perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me.\'94 The hunched, pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder. \'93Toss the meat into the cages,\'94 Aemon instructed him. \'93The birds will do the rest. \'93 \
Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits. The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the metal with night-black wings. The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint. He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter. Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece. Quickly Jon gra
\f3 bbed
\f1  a second handful and threw it in after th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  first. \'93Lord Mormont\'92s raven likes fruit and corn.\'94 \
\'93He is a rare bird,\'94 the maester said. \'93Most ravens will eat
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 grain, but they prefer flesh. It makes them strong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood. In that they are like\
men . . . and like men, not all ravens are alike.\'94 \
J
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n had nothing to say to that. He threw meat, wondering why he\'92d been summoned. No doubt the old man would tell him, in his own good time. Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried. \
\'93Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,\'94 the maester went on, \'93though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawks . . . yet ravens a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e black, and 
\f3 they eat t
\f1 he dead, so some godly men abhor 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem. Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with doves, did you know?\'94 The maester turn
\f3 ed hi
\f1 s w
\f3 hi
\f1 te eyes on Jon, smiling. \'93The Night\'92s Watch prefers ravens.\'94 \
Jon\'92s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist. \'93Dywen says the wildli
\f2\fs24 n
\f1 \cf3 gs call u\cf2 s \cf3 crows,\'94 he said un\cf2 ce\cf3 rtain
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3 y. \
\'93The\cf2  c\cf3 row is the raven\'92s\cf2  p\cf3 oor c
\f2 \cf2 o
\f0\b\fs38 usin. The
\f2\b0\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.\'94 \
Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, a
\f3 nd wh
\f1 y. What did he care about ravens and doves? If the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 old man had something to say to him, why couldn\'92t he \
just say it? \
\'93Jon, did you ever wo
\f3 nder wh
\f1 y the men of the Night\'92s Watch take no wives and father no children?\'94 Maester Aemon asked. \
Jon shrugged. \'93No.\'94 He scattered more meat. The fingers of his left hand we
\f3 re slimy wi
\f1 th blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket. \
\'93So they will not love,\'94 the old man answered, \'93for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.\'94 \
That did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing. The maester was a hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night\'92s Watch; it was not his place
\f3  to cont
\f1 ra
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ict him. \
The old man seemed to sense his doubts. \'93Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the oth
\f3 er, what 
\f1 would he do?\'94 \
Jon hesitated. He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor himsel
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 , not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he will not even say her name. \'93He would do whatever was right,\'94 he said . . . ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. \'93
\f3 No matter
\f1  what.\'94 \
\'93Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman\'92s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms . . . or the memory of a brother\'92s smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great traged
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 . \
\'93The men who formed the Night\'92s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the dark
\f3 ness to the
\f1  north. They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve. So they vowed they would have no wives nor children. \
\'93Yet brothers they had, and sisters. Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names. They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change, but men do not. So they pledged as well that the Night\'92s Watch would take n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  part in the battles of the realms it guarded. \
\'93They kept their pledge. When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren\'92s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  with ten thousand swords to hand. He did not march. In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a \
generation passed that three or four of them were not at war. The Watch took no part. When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts. So it has always been, for years beyond counting. Such is the price of honor. \
\'93A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear. And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it. How easy i
\f3 t see
\f1 ms then, to walk the path of honor. Yet soon or late in every man\'92s life comes a day w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en it is not easy, a day when he must choose.\'94 \
Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangli
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g from their beaks. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rest seemed to be watching him. Jon could feel the weight of all those
\f3  tiny 
\f1 black eyes. \'93And this is my day . . . is that what you\'92re say
\f3 ing?\'94
\f1  \
Maester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes. It was as if he were seeing right into his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 heart. Jon felt naked and exposed. He took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars. Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens. They took to the air, shrieking wildly. The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped the
\f3 m down gr
\f1 eedily. Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor. \
The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder. \'93It hurts, boy,\'94 he said softly. \'93Oh, yes. Choosing . . . it has always hurt. And always will. I know.\'94 \
\'93You don\'92t know,\'94 Jon said bitterly. \'93No one knows. Even if I am his bastard, he\'92s still my father
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . . \'94 \
Maester Aemon sighed. \'93Have you heard nothing I\'92ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?\'94 He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. \'93Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and 
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28 nce when I had grown old. By
\f1  then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would bring the news from the south, words d
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. What could I hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28  done,
\f1  old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother\'92s poor grandson, and his son, an
\f3 d even the li
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 tle children . . . \'94 \
Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears
\f1  i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the old man\'92s 
\f3 eyes.
\f1  \'93Who are you?\'94 he asked quietly, almost in dread. \
A toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips. \'93Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night\'92s Watch. In my order, we put aside our house \
names when we take our vows and don the collar.\'94 The old man touched the maester\'92s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless nec
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 . \'93My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe. 
\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 e
\f3 mon, he 
\f1 called me . . . \'94 \
\'93Aemon . . . Targaryen?\'94 Jon could scarcely believe it. \
\'93Once,\'94 the old m
\f3 an sa
\f1 id. \'93Once. So you see
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Jon, I do know . . . and knowing, I will not tell you stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and l
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ve with it all the rest of your days. As I have.\'94 His voice fell to a whisper. \'93As I have . . . \'94 \

\f1  \
When the battle was done, Dan
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  rode her silver through the fields of the dead. Her handmaids and the men of her khas came after, smiling and jesting among themselves. \
Dothraki hooves had torn 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground, whil
\f3 e arakhs
\f1  and arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood. Dy
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng horses lifted their heads and screamed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at her as she rode past. Wounded men moaned and prayed. Jaqqa rhan moved among them, the mercy men with their heavy axes,
\f3  taking 
\f1 a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike
\f3 . Aft
\f1 er
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them would scurry a flock of small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets. Last of all the dogs
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 w
\f3 ould come sn
\f1 iffing, lean and hungry, the feral pack that was never far behind the khalasar. \
The sheep had been dead long
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 st. There seemed to be thousands of them,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 black with flies, arrow shafts bristling from each carcass. Khal Ogo\'92s riders had done that, Dany
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 knew; no man of Drogo\'92s khalasar wo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ld be such a fool as to waste his arrows on she
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p when there were shepherds yet to kill. \
The town was afire, black plumes of sm
\f3 oke ro
\f1 iling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky. Beneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging their long whips as they herded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and children of Ogo\'92s khalasar walked with a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; they were slaves now, but they seemed not to fear it.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them; she remembered what terror felt like. Mothers stumbled along with blank, dead faces, pulling sobbing children by the hand. There were only a few men among them, cripples and cowards and grandfathers. \
Ser Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki called them haesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for they had the same copper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked al
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 en to her, squat and flat-faced, their black hair cropped unnaturally short. They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo said they belonged south of the river bend. The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep. \
Dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river. A rider cut him off and
\f3  turned him
\f1 , and the others boxed him in, cracking their whips in his face, running him this way and that. \
One galloped behind him, lashing him across the buttocks u
\f3 ntil 
\f1 his thighs ran red with blood. Another snared his ankle with a lash and sent him sprawling. Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through his back. \
Ser Jorah met her outside the shattered gate. He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail. His gauntlets, greaves, and greath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lm were dark grey steel. The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he donned his armor, but the knight h
\f3 ad sp
\f1 it insults right back in their tee
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h, tem
\f3 pers had
\f1  flared, longsword had clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death. \
Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up. \'93Your lord husband awaits you within the town.\'94 \
\'93Drogo took no ha
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 m?\'94 \
\'93A few cuts,\'94 Ser Jorah answered, \'93nothing of consequence. He slew two khals this day. Khal Ogo first, and then the son, Fogo, who became khal when Ogo fell. His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, and now Khal Drogo\'92s every step rings louder than before.\'94 \
Ogo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast where Viserys had bee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  crowned, but that was in Vaes Dothrak, beneath the Mother of Mountains, where every rider was a brother and 
\f3 all 
\f1 quarrels were put aside. It was diffe
\f3 rent o
\f1 ut in the grass. Ogo\'92s khalasar had been attacking the town when Khal Drogo caught him. She wondered what the Lamb Men had thou
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ht, when they first saw the dust
\f3  of th
\f1 eir horses from atop those cracked-mud walls. Perhaps a few, the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the prayers of desperate men, took it for deliverance. \
Across t
\f3 he road,
\f1  a girl no
\f3  olde
\f1 r than Dany was so
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 bing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a pile of corpses, facedown, and thrust himself inside 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er. Other riders dismounted to take their turns. That was the sort of deliverance the Dothraki brought the Lamb Men. \
I am the blood of the dragon, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself as she turned h
\f3 er fa
\f1 ce away. She pressed her lips togeth
\f3 er an
\f1 d hardened her heart and 
\f3 rode on t
\f1 oward the gate. \
\'93Most of Ogo\'92s riders fled,\'94 Ser Jorah was saying. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Still, there may be as many as ten thousand captives.\'94 \
Slaves, Dany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\'92s Bay. She wanted
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This
\f3  is w
\f1 ar, \
this is what it looks like, this is the price of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Iron Throne. \
\'93I\'92ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen,\'94 Ser Jorah said. \'93They\'92ll pay a better price than he\'92d ge
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  from a slaving caravan. Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year, so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls, and triple for boys under ten. If enough children survive the journe
\f3 y, the go
\f1 ld will buy us all the ships 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e need, and hire men to sail them.\'94 \
Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobb
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng wail that went on and on and on. Dany\'92s hand clenched hard around the reins, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd she turned the silver\'92s head. \'93Make t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em stop,\'94 she commanded Ser Jorah. \
\'93Khaleesi?\'94 The knight sounded perplexed.\
\'93You heard my words,\'94 she said. \'93Stop them.\'94 She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents \
of Dothraki. \'93Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape.\'94 The warriors exchanged a baffled look. \
Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer. \'93Princess,\'94 he sai
\f3 d, \'93you 
\f1 have a gentle heart, but you do not understand. This is how it has always been. Those men have shed blood for the khal. Now
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 they claim their reward.\'94 \
Across the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to Dany\'92s ears. The first man was
\f3  done wit
\f1 h her now, and a second had taken his place. \
\'93She is a lamb girl,\'94 Quaro said in Dothraki. \'93She is nothing, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. The Lamb Men 
\f3 lay 
\f1 wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  shee
\f3 p, it
\f1  is known.\'94 \
\'93It is known,\'94
\f3  her han
\f1 dmaid Irri echoed. \
\'93It is known,\'94 agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him. \'93If he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  wailing offends your ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue.\'94 He drew his arakh. \
\'93I will not have her harmed,\'94 Dany said. \'93I claim her. Do as I command you, or Khal Drog
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  will know the reason why.\'94 \
\'93Ai, Khaleesi,\'94 Jhogo replied, kicking his horse. Quaro and the others followed his lead, the bells in their hair chiming. \
\'93Go with them,\'94 she commanded Ser Jorah. \
\'93As you command.\'94 The knight gave her a curious l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ok. \'93You are your brother\'92s sister, in truth.\'94 \
\'93Viserys?\'94 She did not understand. \
\'93No,\'94 h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  answered. \'93Rhaegar.\'94 He galloped off. \
Dany heard Jhogo shout. The rapers laughed at him. One man shouted back. Jhogo\'92s a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 akh f
\f3 lashe
\f1 d, and the man\'92s head went tumbling from his shoulders. Laughter turned to curses as the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 horsemen reached for weapons, but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there. She saw Aggo point across the road to where she sat upon her silver. The riders loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ed at her with cold black eyes. One spat. The others scattered to their mounts, muttering. \
All the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 , so intent on his pleasure that he seemed unaware of what was going on around him. Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched him off with a mailed hand. The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Dothraki went sprawling in the 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ud, bounced up with a knife in hand, and died with Aggo\'92s a
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 r
\f3 ow th
\f1 rough his throat. Mormont pulled
\f3  the 
\f1 girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in his blood- spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. \'93What do you
\f3  want 
\f1 done with her?\'94 \
The girl was trembling, her eyes wide and vague. Her hair was matted with blood. \'93Doreah, see to her hurts. You do not have a rider\'92s look, perhaps she will not fear you. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  rest, with me.\'94 She urged the silver 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hrough the broken wooden gate. \
It was worse inside the town. Many of th
\f3 e hous
\f1 es were afire, and the jaqqa rha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  had been about their grisly work. Headless corpses filled the narrow, twisty lanes. They passed
\f3  other
\f1  women being raped. Each time Dany reined up, sent her khas 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave. One of them, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany haltingly in the Common Tongue, but from the others she got only flat black stares. They were suspicious of her, she realized with sadness; afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate. \
\'93You cannot claim them all, child,\'94 Ser Jorah said, the fourth time they stopped, while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her. \
\'93I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon,\'94 Dany reminded him. \'93It is not for you to tell me what I cannot do.\'94 Across the city, a building collapsed in a great gou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  of fire and smoke, and she heard distant
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 screams and the wailing of frightened children. \
They found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and a bulbous dome like some immense brown onion. Beside him was a pi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e of heads taller than he was. One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his up
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 er arm, and blood covered the left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint. H
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s three bloodriders were with him. \
Jhiqui helped Dany dismount; she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier. She knelt before t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e khal. \'93My sun-and-stars is wou
\f3 nded
\f1 .\'94 The arakh cut was wide but shallow; his left nipple was gone, and a flap of blood
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag. \
\'93Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo
\f3 ,\'94 Kh
\f1 al Drogo said in the Common Tongue. \'93I kill him for it, and Ogo too.\'94 He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly. \'93
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 s Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.\'94 \
\'93No man can stand before the sun of my life,\'94 Dany said, \'93the fath
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r of the stallion who mounts the worl
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 .\'94 \
A mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle. He spoke to Haggo, a stream of angry Dothraki too fast for Dan
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  to understand. The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ok before he turned to his khal \'93This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo. He says the khaleesi has taken his spoils, a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount.\'94 \
Khal Drogo\'92s
\f3  face 
\f1 was still and hard, but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany. \'93Tell me the truth of this, moon of my life,\'94 he commanded in Dothraki. \
Dany told him what she had done, in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better, her words simple and direct. \
When she was done, Drogo was fro
\f3 wning
\f1 . \'93This is the way of war. These women are our slaves now, to do with as we please.\'94 \
\'93It pleases 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e to hold them safe,\'94 Dany said, wondering if she had dared too much. \'93If your warriors would mount these women, let them take them gently and keep them for wives. Give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons.\'94 \
Qotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders. It was he who laughed. \'93Does the horse breed with the sheep?\'94 \
Something in his tone reminded her of Viserys. Dany turned on him angrily. \'93The \
dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.\'94 \
Khal Drogo smiled. \'93See how fierce she grows!\'94 he said. \'93It is my son inside her, the stallion 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ho mounts the world, filling her with his fire. Ride slowly
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Qotho . . . if the mother does not burn you where you sit, the son will trample y
\f3 ou in
\f1 to the mud. And you, Mago, hold your tongue and find another lamb to mount. The
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e belong to my khaleesi.\'94 He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, but as he lifted his arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head. \
Dany could a
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 most feel his agony. The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led her to believe. \'93Where are the healers?\'94 she demanded. The khalasar had two sorts: barren women and eunuch slaves. The herbwomen dealt in potions and spells, the eunuchs in knife, needle, and fire. \'93Why do they not attend the khal?\'94 \
\'93The khal sent the hairless men away, Khaleesi,\'94 old Cohollo assured her. Dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself; a deep gash in his left shoulder. \
\'93Many riders are hurt,\'94 Khal Drogo said stubbornly. \'93Let them be healed first. This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly, this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son.\'94 \
Dany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away. A trickle of blood
\f3  ran 
\f1 from the arrow that pierced his arm. \'93It is not for Khal Drogo to wait,\'94 she proclaimed. \'93Jhogo, seek out these eunuchs and bring them here at once.\'94 \
\'93Silver Lady,\'94 a woman\'92s voice said behind her, \'93I can help the Great Rider with his hurts.\'94 \
Dany turned her head. The speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed, the heavy, flat- nosed woman who had blessed her. \
\'93The khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep,\'94 barked Qotho. \'93Aggo, cut out her tongue.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 A
\f1\fs28 ggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat. Dany lifted a hand. \'93No. She is mine. Let
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her speak.\'94 Aggo looked from her to Qotho. He lowered his knife. \
\'93I meant no wrong, fierce riders.\'94 The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes she wore h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d once
\f3  bee
\f1 n the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, but now they \
were mud-caked and bloody and ri
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ped. She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. \'93I have some small skill 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the healing arts.\'94 \
\'93Who are you?\'94 Dany asked her. \
\'93I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I am godswife of this t
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 mple.\'94 \
\'93Maegi,\'94 grunted Haggo, fingering his arakh. His look was dark. Dany remembered
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the word from a terrifying story that Jhiqui had told her one night by the cookfire. A maegi was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came to men 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n the dark of night
\f3  and 
\f1 sucked life and strength from their bodies. \
\'93I am a healer,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur said. \
\'93A healer o
\f3 f she
\f1 eps,\'94 sne
\f3 ered 
\f1 Qotho. \'93Blood of my bl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 od, I say kill this maegi and wait for the hairless men.\'94 \
Dany ignored the bloodrider\'92s outburst. This old, homely, t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1 \cf3 ickbodied\cf2  w\cf3 oman did not look \cf2 li\cf3 ke a 
\f2 \cf2 m
\f1 \cf3 aegi to h\cf2 er\cf3 . \'93Where did you l\cf2 ea\cf3 rn yo

\f0\b\fs38 r heali
\f2\b0\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g, Mirri Maz Duur?\'94 \
\'93My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the Great Shepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry. When I was younger and more fair, I went in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow, to learn from their mages. Ships fr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 m many lands come to Asshai, so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distant peoples. A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin.\'94 \
Ser Jorah Mormont spoke up. \'93A maester?\'94 \
\'93Marwyn, he named himself,\'94 the woman replied in the Common Tongue. \'93From the sea. Beyond the sea. The Seve
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where men are iron and dragons rule. He taught me this speech.\'94 \
\'93A maester in Asshai,\'94 Ser Jorah mused. \'93Tell me, Godswife, what did this Marwyn wear a
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 out his neck?\'94 \
\'93A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many metals.\'94 \
The knight looked at Dany. \'93Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown wears such a chain,\'94 he said, \'93and such men do know much of healing.\'94 \
\'93Why should you want to help my khal?\'94\
\'93All men are one flock, o
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  so we are taught,\'94 replied Mirri Maz Duur. \'93The Great \
Shepherd sent me to earth to heal his lambs, wherever I might find them.\'94 Qotho gave her a stinging slap. \'93We are no sheep, maegi.\'94\
\'93Stop it,\'94 Dany said angrily. \'93She is mine. I wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l not have her harmed.\'94 Khal Drogo grunted. \'93The ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ow must come out, Qotho.\'94 \
\'93Yes, Great Rider,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur answered, touching her bruised face. \'93And your breast must b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  washed and sewn, lest the wound fester.\'94 \
\'93Do it, then,\'94 Khal Drogo commanded. \
\'93Great Rider,\'94 the woma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  said, \'93my tools and potions are inside the god\'92s house, where the healing powers are strongest.\'94 \
\'93I will carry you, blood of my blood,\'94 Haggo offered. \
Khal Drogo waved him away. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 I need no man\'92s help,\'94 he said, in a voice proud and hard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo\'92s arakh had cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly to his side. \'93I am no man,\'94 she whispered, \'93so you may lean on me.\'94 Drogo put a huge
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as they walked toward the great mud temple. Th
\f3 e th
\f1 ree bloodriders followed. Dany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f her khas to guard the entrance and make certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. \
They passed through a series of anterooms, into the high 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 entral chamber under the onion. Faint light shone down through hidden windows above. A few torches burnt smokily from sconces on the walls. Sheepskins were scattered across
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the mud floor. \'93There,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur said, pointing to the altar, a massive blue-veined stone carved with images 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f shepherds and their flocks. Khal Drogo lay upon it. The old woman threw a handful of dried leaves onto a brazier, filling the chamber with fragrant smoke. \'93Best if you wait outside,\'94 she told the rest of them. \
\'93We are blood of his blood,\'94 Cohollo said. \'93Here we wait.\'94 \
Qotho stepped close to Mirri Maz Duur. \'93Know this, wife of the Lamb God. Harm the khal and you suffer the same.\'94 He dr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w his skinning knife and showed her the blade.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93She will do no harm.\'94 Dany felt she could trust this old, plainfaced woman with her flat nose; she had saved her from the hard hands of her rapers, after all. \
\'93If you must stay, then help,\'94 Mirri told the bloodriders. \'93The Great Rider is too strong for me. Hold him still while I draw the arrow from his flesh.\'94 She let the rags of her gown fall to her waist as she opened a carved chest, and busied herself with bottles and boxes, knives and needles. When she was ready, she broke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the sing
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ong tongue of the Lhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over his wounds. Khal Drogo cursed her, but he did not move. She bound the ar
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing it with a pale green paste 
\f3 before 
\f1 she pulled the flap of skin back in place. The khal ground his teeth together and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 swallowed a scream. The godswife took out a silver needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh. When she was done she painted the skin with red ointment, covered it with more leaves, and bound the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 breast in a ragged piece of lambskin. \'93You must say the prayers I give you and keep the lambskin in place for te
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  days and ten nights,\'94 she said. \'93There will be fever, and itching, and a great scar when the heali
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g is done.\'94 \
Khal Drogo sat, bells ringing. \'93I sing of my scars, sheep woman.\'94 He flexed his arm and scowled. \
\'93Drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy,\'94 she cautioned him.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Pain you will have, but you must keep your body strong to fight the poison spirits.\'94 \
\'93I am khal,\'94 Drogo said. \'93I spit on pain and drink what I like. Cohollo, bring my vest.\'94 The older man hastened off. \
\'93Before,\'94 Dany said to the ugly Lhazareen woman, \'93I heard you speak
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of birthing songs . . . \'94 \
\'93I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur replied. \
\'93My time is near,\'94 Dany said. \'93I would have you attend me when he comes, if you would.\'94 \
Khal Drogo laughed. \'93Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her. She will do as you command.\'94 He jumped down from the altar. \'93Come, my blood. The stallions call, this place is ashes. It is time to ride.\'94 \
Haggo followed the khal from the temple, but Qotho lingered long enough to favor Mirri Maz Duur with a stare. \'93Remember, maegi, as the khal fares, so shall you.\'94 \
\'93As you say, rider,\'94 the woman answered him, gathering up her jars and bottles. \'93The Great Shepherd guards the flock.\'94 \

TYRION \
On a hill overlooking the kingsroad, a long trestle table of rough-hewn pine had been erected beneath an elm tree and covered with a golden cloth.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal with his chief knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike. \
Tyrion arrived late, saddlesore, and sour, all too vividly aware of how amusing he must look as he wa
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 dled up the slope to his father. The day\'92s march had been long and tiring. He thought he
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 might get quite drunk tonight. It was twilight, and the air was alive with drifting fireflies. \
The cooks were serving the meat course: five suckling pigs, skin seared and crackling, a different fruit in every mouth. The smell made his mouth water. \'93My pardons,\'94 he began, taking his p
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ace on the bench beside his uncle. \
\'93Perhaps I\'92d best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion,\'94 Lord Tywin said. \'93If you are as late to battle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive.\'94 \
\'93Oh, surely you can save me a peasant or two, Father,\'94 Tyrion replied. \'93Not too many, I wouldn\'92t want to be greedy.\'94 He filled his wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig. The crisp skin crackled under his knife, and hot juice ran from the meat. It was the loveliest sight Tyrion had seen in ages. \
\'93Ser Addam\'92s outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins,\'94 his father reported as his trencher was filled with slic
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s of pork. \'93Lord Frey\'92s levies have joined them. They 
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 re li
\f1 kely no more t
\f3 han a day\'92s march north of u
\f1 s.\'94 \
\'93Please, Father,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93I\'92m about to eat.\'94 \
\'93Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you, Tyrion? Your brother Jaime would be eager to come to grips with him.\'94 \
\'93I\'92d sooner come to grips with that pig. Robb Stark is not half so tender, and he never smelled as good.\'94 \
Lord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies, leaned forward. \'93I hope your savages do not share your reluct
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nce, else we\'92ve wasted our good steel on them.\'94 \
\'93My savages will put your steel to excellent use, my lord,\'94 Tyrion replied. When he had told Lefford he needed arms and armor to equip the three hundred men Ulf had fetched d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wn out of the foothills, you would have thought he\'92d asked the man to turn his virgin daughters over to their pleasure. \
Lord Lefford frowned. \'93I saw th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t great hairy one today, the one who insisted that he must have two battle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades.\'94 \
\'93S
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 agga likes to kill with either hand,\'94 Tyrion said as a trencher of steaming pork was laid in front of him. \
\'93He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28 \'94 \
\'93Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two.\'94 Tyrion reached a thumb and forefinger into the salt dish, and sprinkled a healthy pinch over his meat. \
Ser Kevan leaned forward. \'93We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 vanguard when we come to battle.\'94 \
Ser Kevan seldom \'93had a thought\'94 that Lord Tywin had not had first. Tyrion had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his 
\f3 mouth
\f1 . Now he lowered it. \'93The vanguard?\'94 he repeated dubiously. Either his lord father had a new respect for Tyrion\'92s abilities, or he\'92d decided to rid himself of h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s embarrassing get for good. Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 They seem ferocious enough,\'94 Ser Kevan said. \
\'93Ferocious?\'94 Tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird. His father watched, judging him, weighing every word. \'93Let me tell you how ferocious they are. Last night, a Moon Brot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened his throat for him. Perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back, I 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ouldn\'92t say. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man\'92s cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay.\'94 \
\'93When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander,\'94 his father said. His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly, and die for \
him if need be. Tyrion lacked that gift. He bought loyalty with gold, and compell
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d obedience with his name. \'93A bigger man would be able to put the fear in them, is that what you\'92re saying, my lord?\'94 \
Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother. \'93If my son\'92s men will not obey his commands, perhaps the vanguard is not the place
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 for him. No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear, guarding our baggage train.\'94 \
\'93Do me no kindnesses, Father,\'94 he said angrily. \'93If you have no other command to offer me, I\'92ll lead your van.\'94 \
Lord Tywin studied h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s dwarf son. \'93I said nothing about command. You will serve under Ser Gregor.\'94 \
Tyrion took one bite of pork, chewed a moment, and spit it out angrily. \'93I find I am not hungry after all,\'94 he said
\f3 , cli
\f1 mbing awkwardly off the bench
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93Pray excuse me, my lords.\'94 \
Lord Tywin inclined his head, dismissing him. Tyrion turned and walked away. He was conscious of their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill. A great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but he did not look back. He hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs. \
Dusk had settled, turning all the banners black. The Lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river and the kingsr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ad. In amongst the men and the horses and the trees, it was easy to get lost, and Tyrion did. He passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires. Fireflies drifted among
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t the tents like wandering stars. He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so tempting it made his empty stomach growl. Aw
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y in the distance, he heard voices raised in some bawdy song. A giggling woman raced past him, naked beneath a dark cloak, her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on, two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f a stream, practicing their thrust-and-parry in the fading light, their chests bare and slick with sweat. \
No one looked at him. No one spoke to him. No one paid him any mind. He was surrounded by men sworn to House Lannister, a vast host twent
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  thousand strong, and yet he was alone. \
When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga\'92s laughter booming through the dark, he followed it to the Ston
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Crows in their small corner of the night. Conn son of Coratt waved a tankard of ale
\f3 . \'93Tyrion Halfm
\f1 an! Co
\f3 me, sit by our f
\f1 ire
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  share meat with the Stone Crows. We have an ox.\'94 \
\'93I can see that, Conn son of Coratt.\'94 The huge red carcass was su
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 pended over a roaring \
fire, skewered on a spit the size of a small tree. No doubt it was a small tree. Blood and grease drip
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ed down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the meat. \'93I thank you. Send for me when the ox is cooked.\'94 From 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he look of it, that might even be before the battle. He walked on. \
Each clan had its own cook
\f3 fire;
\f1  Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, Stone Crows did not eat with Moon Brothers
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and no one ate with Burned Men. The modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford\'92s stores had been erected in the cente
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  of the four fires. Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the new servants. Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a body servant to see to his needs, and even insisted he take a squire. They were seated 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 round the embers of a small
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cookfire. A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired, 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 o more than eighteen by the look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 fore he spied fishbones in the ashes. \'93What did you eat?\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93Trout, m\'92lord,\'94 said his groom. \'93Bronn caug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t them.\'94 \
Trout, he thought. Suckling pig. Damn my father. He stared mournfully at the bones, his belly rumbling.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
His squire, a boy with the unfortunate name
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of Podrick Payne, swallowed whatever he had been about to say. The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ily
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  Payne, the king\'92s headsman . . . and almost as quiet, although not for want of a tongue. Tyrion had made him stick it out once, just to be certain. \'93Definitely a tongue,\'94 he had said. \'93Someday you must learn to use it.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
At the moment, he did not have the patience to try
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl. \'93Is this he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 he asked Bronn. \
She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more. \'93It is, m\'92lord, and she can speak for herse
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 f, if it please you.\'94 \
He cocked his head to one side. \'93I am Tyrion, of House Lannister. Men call me the Imp.\'94 \'93My
\f3  mother named me 
\f1 Shae. Men call me . . . often.\'94 \
Bronn laughed, and Tyrion had to smile. \'93Into the tent, Shae, if you would be so kind.\'94 He lifted the flap and held it for her. Inside, he knelt to light a candle. \
The life of a so
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 dier was not without certain compensations. Wherever you 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ave a camp, you are certain to have camp followers. At the end of the day\'92s march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore. \'93I would prefer one who is reasonably young, \
with as pretty a face as you can find,\'94 he had said. \'93If she has washed sometime this year, I shall be glad. If she hasn\'92t, 
\f3 wash her. Be cert
\f1 ain that y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u tell her who I am, and warn her of what I am.\'94 Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they\'92d been hired to \
pleasure . . . a took that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again. \
He lifted the candle and looked her over. Bronn had done well enough; she was doe-eyed and slim, wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked. He liked that. \'93Shall I take my gown off, m\'92lord?\'94 she asked. \
\'93In good time. Are you a maiden,
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 Shae?
\f1 \'94\
\'93If it please you, m
\f3 \'92lord,\'94 she said 
\f1 de
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 urely.\
\'93What would please me would be the truth of you, girl.\'94 \'93Aye, but that will cost you double.\'94 \
Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly. \'93I am a Lannister. Gold I hav
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  in plenty, and you\'92ll find me generous . . . but I\'92ll want more from you than what you\'92ve got between your legs, though I\'92ll want that too. You\'92ll share my tent, pour my wine, laugh at my jests, rub the ache from my legs after each day\'92s ride . . . and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed.\'94 \
\'93Fair enough.\'94 She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion, tossing it aside. There was nothing underneath but Shae. \'93If he don\'92t put down that candle, m\'92lord will burn his fingers.\'94 \
Tyrion put
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 down the candle, took her hand in his, and pulled her gently to him. She bent to kiss him. He
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  mouth tasted of honey and cloves, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  her fingers 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ere deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of his clothes. \
When he entered her, she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small, shuddering gasps of pleasure. Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned, but she did it so well that it did not matter. That much truth he did not crave. \
He had needed her, Tyrion realized afterward, as she lay quietly in his arms. Her or someone like her. It had been nigh on a year since he\'92d lain with a woman, since before he had set out for Winterfell in company with his brother and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 King Robert. He could well die on the morrow or the day after, and if he did, he would sooner go to his grave thinking of Shae than of his lord father, Lysa Arryn, or the Lady Catelyn Stark. \
He could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she lay beside him. That was a good feeling. A song filled his head. Softly, quietly, he began to whistle. \
\'93What\'92s that, m\'92lord?\'94 Shae murmured against him.\
\'93Nothing,\'94 he told her. \'93A song I learned as a boy, that\'92s all. Go to sleep, sweetling.\'94 \
When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently, so as not to disturb her sleep. Naked, he crawled outside, stepped over hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  squire, and walked around behind his tent to make water. \
Bronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree, near where they\'92d tied the horses. He was honing the edge of his sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men. \'93Where did you find her?\'94 Tyrion asked him as he pissed. \
\'93I took her from a knight. The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed his thinking somewhat . . . that, and my dirk at his throat.\'94 \
\'93Splendid,\'94 Tyrion said dryly, s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 aking off the last drops. \'93I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not make me an enemy.\'94 \
\'93The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 pretty ones were all claimed,\'94 Bronn said. \'93I\'92ll be pleased to take her back if you\'92d prefer a toothless drab.\'94 \
Tyrion limped closer to where he sat. \'93My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the mines for impertinence.\'94 \
\'93Good for me you\'92re not your father,\'94 Bronn replied. \'93I saw one with boils all over her nose. Would you like her?\'94 \
\'93What, and break your heart?\'94 Tyrion shot back. \'93I shall keep Shae. Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  I\'92d rather not have him beside me in the battle.\'94 \
Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand. \'93You\'92ll have me beside you in the battle, dwarf.\'94 \
Tyrion nodded. The night air was warm on his bare skin. \'93See that I survive this battle, and you can name your reward.\'94 \
Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left, and tried a cut. \'93Who\'92d want \
to kill the likes of you?\'94 \
\'93My lord father, for 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ne. He\'92s put me in the van.\'94 \
\'93I\'92d do the same. A small man with a big shield. You\'92ll give the archers fits.\'94 \
\'93I find you oddly cheering,\'94 Tyrion said. \'93I must be mad.\'94 \
Bronn sheathed his sword. \'93Beyond a doubt.\'94 \
When Tyrion returned to his tent, Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily, \'93I woke and m\'92lord was gone.\'94 \
\'93M\'92lord is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back now.\'94 He slid in beside her. \
Her hand went between his stunted legs, and found him hard. \'93Yes he is,\'94 she whispered, stroking him. \
He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling. \'93You need not fear his like, m\'92lord,\'94 the girl said, her fingers busy at his cock. \'93He is a small man.\'94 \
\'93And what am I, pray?\'94 Tyrion asked her. \'93A giant?\'94 \
\'93Oh, yes,\'94 she purred, \'93my giant of Lannister.\'94 She mounted him then, and for a time, she almost made him believe it.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Tyrion went to sleep smiling . . . \
. . . and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets. Shae was shaking him by the shoulder. \'93M\'92lord,\'94 she whispered. \'93Wake up, m\'92lord. I\'92m frightened.\'94 \
Groggy, he sat up and threw back the blanket. The horns called through the night, wild and urgent, a cry that said hurry hurry hurry. He heard shouts, the clatter of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing yet that spoke to him of fighting. \'93My lord fat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er\'92s trumpets,\'94 he said. \'93Battle assembly. I thought Stark was yet a day\'92s march away.\'94 \
Shae shook her head, lost. Her eyes were wide and white. \
Groaning, Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside, shouting for his squire. Wisps of pale fog drifted through the night, long white fingers off the river. Men and horses blundered through the predawn chill; saddles were being cinched, wagons loaded, fires extinguished. The 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 rumpets blew again: hurry hurry hurry. Knights \
vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as they ran. When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly. Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe. \'93My armor,\'94 he said, \'93an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  be quick about it.\'94 Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and ahorse, wearing his battered halfhelm. \'93Do you know what\'92s happened?\'94 Tyrion asked him. \
\'93The Stark boy stole a march on us,\'94 Bronn said. \'93He crept down the kingsroad in the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 night, and now his host is less than a mile north
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of here, forming up in battle array.\'94 \
Hurry, the trumpets called, hurry hurry hurry. \
\'93See t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at the clansmen are ready to ride.\'94 Tyrion ducked back inside his tent. \'93Where are my clothes?\'94 he barked at
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Shae. \'93There. No, the leather, damn it. Yes. Bring me my boots.\'94 \
By the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was. Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate, expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body. Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not. He had to make do with oddments assembled from Lord Lefford\'92s wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead knight\'92s gorget, lobstered greaves and g
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 untlets and pointed steel boots. Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it matched, or fit as it should. His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found a huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike. \
Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps. \'93If I die, weep for me,\'94 Tyrion told the whore. \
\'93How will you know? You\'92ll be dead.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ll know.\'94 \
\'93I believe you would.\'94 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 hae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and Pod fastened it to his gorget. Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ight of shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formi
\f3 dable br
\f1 own courser armored as heavily as he was. He needed help to mount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of heavy ir
\f3 onwood banded with steel. 
\f1 La
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tly they gave him his battle-axe. Shae stepped back and looked him over. \'93M\'92lord looks fearsome.\'94 \
\'93M\'92lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor,\'94 Tyrion answered sourly, \'93but I thank you for the kindness. Podrick, should the battle go against us, see the lady safely home.\'94 He saluted her with his axe, wheeled his horse about, and trotted off. His stomach was a \
hard knot, so tight it pained him. Behind, his servants hurriedly began to strike his tent. Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun broke over the horizon. The western sky was a deep purple, speckled with stars. Tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise he would ever see . . . and whether wondering was a mark of cowardice. Did his brother Jaime ever contemplate death before a battle? \
A warhorn sounded in the far distance, a deep mournful note that chilled the soul. The clansmen climbed onto their scrawny mountain horses, shouting cur
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 es and rude jokes. Several appeared to be drunk. The rising sun was burning off the drifting tendrils of fog as Tyrion led them off. What grass the horses had left was heavy with dew, as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth. The mountain men fell in behind him, each clan arrayed behind its own leaders. \
In the dawn light, the army of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron rose, thorns gleaming. \
His uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines, to east and west of the road, and stood calmly s
\f2\fs24 t
\f3\fs28 ringing their bows. Between them
\f1 , pikemen formed squares; behind were rank on rank of men-at-arms with spear and sword and axe. Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser Kevan and the lords bannermen Lefford, Lydden, and Serrett with all their sworn retainers. \
The right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the weigh
\f3 t of
\f1  their armor. More than three quarters of the knights were there, massed together like a great steel fist. Ser Addam Marbrand had the command. Tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange and smoke. Behind him flew Ser Fle
\f3 ment\'92s purple unic
\f1 orn, the brindled
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 boar of Crakehal
\f3 l, the bantam rooster of Sw
\f1 yft, and more. \
His lord father took his 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 lace on the hill where he had slept. Around him, the reserve assembled; a
\f3  huge force, half mounted a
\f1 nd half foot, five thousand strong. Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the reserve; he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him, committing his forces when and where th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 y were needed most. \
Even from afar, his lord father was resplendent. Tywin Lannister\'92s battle armor put his son Jaime\'92s gilded suit to shame. His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth- of-gold, so heavy that it barely stirred even when he charged, so large that its drape covered most of his stallion\'92s hindquarters when he took the saddle. No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight, so the greatcloak was held in place b
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  a matched pair of miniatur
\f3 e lionesses crouching on his shoulders,
\f1  as if poised to spring. Their mate, a male \
with a magnificent mane, reclined atop Lord Tywin\'92s greathelm, one paw raking the air as he roared. All three lions were wrought in gold, with ruby eyes. His armor was heavy steel plate, enameled in a dark crimson, greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork. His rondels were golden sunbursts, all his fastenings were gilded, and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone like fire in the light of the rising sun. \
Tyrion
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 could hear the rumble of the foemen\'92s drums now. He remembered Robb Stark as he had last seen him, in his father\'92s high seat in the Great Hall of Winterfell, a sword naked and shining in his hands. He remembered how the direwolves had come at him out of the shadows, and suddenly he could see them again, snarling and snapping, teeth bared in his face. Would the boy bring his wolves to war with him? The thought made him uneasy. \
The northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march. Tyrion wondered what the boy had been thinking. Did he think to take them unawares while they slept? Small chance of that; whatever else might be said of him, Tywin Lannister was no man\'92s fool. \
The van was massing on the left. He saw the standard first, three black dogs on a yellow field. Ser Gregor sat beneath it, mounted on the biggest horse Tyrion had ever seen. Bronn 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ook one look at him and grinned. \'93Always follow a big man into battle.\'94 \
Tyrion threw him a hard look. \'93And why is that?\'94 \
\'93They make such splendid targets. That one, he\'92ll draw t
\f3 he eye
\f1 s of every bowman on the field.\'94 \
Laughing, Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes. \'93I confess, I had not considered it in that light.\'94 \
Clegane had no splendor about him; his armor was steel plate, dull grey, scarred by hard use and showing neither sigil nor ornament. He was pointing men into position with his blade, a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a les
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 er man might wave a dagger. \'93Any man runs, I\'92ll cut him down myself,\'94 he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion. \'93Imp! Take the left. Hold the river. If you can.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 The left of the left. To turn their flank, the Starks would need horses that could run on water. Tyrion led his men toward the riverbank. \'93Look,\'94 he shouted, pointing with his axe. \'93The river.\'94 A blanket of pale mist still clung to the surface of the water, the murky green current swirling past underneath. The shallows were muddy and choked with reeds. \'93That river is ou
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s. Whatever happens, keep close to the water. Never lose sight of \
it. Let no enemy come between us and our river. If they dirty our waters, hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes.\'94 \
Shagga had an axe in either hand. He smashed them together and made them ring. \'93Halfman!\'94 he shouted. Other Stone Crows picked up the cry, and the Black Ears and Moon Brothers as well. The Burned Men did not shout, but they rattled their sword
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and spears. \'93Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!\'94 \
Tyrion turned his courser in a circle to look o
\f3 ver t
\f1 he field. The ground was rolling and uneven here; soft and muddy near the river, rising in a gentle slope toward the kingsroad, stony and broken beyond it, to the cast. A few trees spotted the hillsides, but most of the land had been cleared and planted. His heart pounded in his chest in time to the drums, and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with sweat. He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line, shouting and gesticulating. This wing too was all cavalry, but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers, the vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west: mounted ar
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 hers in leather jerkins, a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords, fieldhands on plow horses armed with scythes and their fathers\'92 rusted swords, half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport . . . and Tyrion
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and his mountain clansmen. \
\'93Crow food,\'94 Bronn muttered beside him, giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid. He could only nod. Had his lord father taken leave of his senses? No pikes, too few bowmen, a bare handful of knights, the ill-armed and unarmored, commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage . . . how could his father expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left? \
He had no time to think about it. The drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his hands to twitching. Bronn drew his longsword, and suddenly the enemy was there before them, boiling over the tops of the hills, advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes. \
Gods be damned, look at them all, Tyrion
\f3  tho
\f1 ught, though he knew his father had more men on the field. Their captains led them on armored warhorses, standard-bearers riding alongside with their banners. He glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn\'92s battle-axe, and the mailed fist of the Glovers . . . and the twin towers of Frey, blue on grey. So mu
\f3 ch f
\f1 or his father\'92s certainty that 
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 ord Walder would not bestir himself. The white of 
\f3 House S
\f1 tark was seen everywh
\f3 ere, the grey direwolves s
\f1 eeming to run and leap as the banners swirled and streamed fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  the high staffs. Where is the boy? Tyrion wondered. \
A warhorn blew. Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo, it cried, its voice as long and low and \
chilling as a cold wind from the north. The Lannister trumpets answered, da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA, brazen and defiant, yet it seemed to Tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller, more anxious. He could feel a fluttering in his
\f3  bowel
\f1 s, a queasy liquid feeling; he hoped he was not going to die sick. \
As the horns died away, a hissing filled the air; a vast flight of arrows arched up from his right, where the archers stood flanking the road. The northerners broke into a run, shouting as they came, but the Lannister arrows fell on them like hail, hundreds of arrows, thous
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 nds
\f1 , and shouts turned to screams as men stumbled and went down. By then a second flight was in the air, and the archers were fitting a third arrow to their bowstrings. \
Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  trumpets blared again, da-DAAA da-DAAA da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAA. Ser Gregor waved his huge sword and bellowed a command, and a thousand other voices screamed back at him. Tyrion put his spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony, and the van surged forward. \'93The riv
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r!\'94 he shouted at his clansmen as they rode. \'93Remember, hew to the river.\'94 He was still leading when they broke a canter, until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and galloped past him, and Shagga howled and followed. The clansmen charged after them, leaving Tyrion in their dust. \
A crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead, a double hedgehog bristling with steel, waiting behind tall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of Karstark. Gregor 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 legane was the first to reach them, lead
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng a wedge of armored veterans. Half the horses shied at the last second, breaking their charge before the row of spears. The others died, sharp steel points ripping through their chests. Tyrion saw a dozen men go down. The Mountain\'92s stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed spearhead raked across his neck. Madden
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d, the beast lunged into the ranks. Spears thrust at him from every side, but the shield wall broke beneath his weight. The northerners stumbled away from the animal\'92s death throes. As his horse fell, snorting blood and biting with his last red breath, the Mountain rose untouched, laying about him with his two-handed greatsword. \
Shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close, other Stone Crows hard behind him. Tyrion shouted, \'93Burned Men! Moon Brothers! After me!\'94 but most of them were ahead of him. He glimpsed Timett son of Timett vault free as his mount died under him in full stride, saw a Moon Brother impaled on a Karstark spear, watched Conn\'92s horse shatter a man\'92s ribs with a kick. A flight of arrows descended on t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em; where they came from he could not say, but they fell on Stark and Lannister al
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ke, rattling off armor or finding flesh. Tyrion lifted his shield and hid beneath it. \
The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 hedgehog was crumbling, the northerners reeling bac
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  under the impact of the mounted assault. Tyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came \
on at a run, saw his axe shear through mail and leather and muscle and lungs. The man was dead on his feet, the axehead lodged in his breast, 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 et Shagga rode on, cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right. Finally the dead man slid off. Shagga smashed the two axes together and roared. \
By then the enemy was on him, and Tyrion\'92s battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around his horse. A man-at-arms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out, knocking the spear aside. The man danc
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d back for another try, but Tyrion spurred his horse and rode right over him. Bronn was surrounded by three foes, but he lopped the head off the first spear that came at him, and raked his blade across a second man\'92s face on his backslash. \
A thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield with a woody chunk. He wheeled and raced after the thrower, but the man raised his own shield over his head. Tyrion circled around him, raining axe blows down on the wood. Chips of oak went flying, until the northerner lost his feet and slipped, failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him. He was below the reach of Tyrion\'92s axe and it was too much bother to dismount, so he left him there and rode after another man, taking him from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up his arm. That won him a moment\'92s respite. Reining up, he looked for the river. There it was, off to the right. Somehow he had gotten turned around. \
A Burned Man rode past, slumped against his horse. A spear had entered his belly and come out through his back. He was past any help, but when Tyrion saw one of the northerners run up and make a grab for his 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 eins, he charged. \
His quarry met him sword in hand. He was tall and spare, wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel, but he\'92d lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead. Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face, but the tall man slammed it aside. \'93Dwarf,\'94 he screamed. \'93Die.\'94 He tur
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ed in a circle as Tyrion rode around him, hacking at his head and shoulders. Steel rang on steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was. Where in the seven hells was Bron
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ? \'93Die,\'94 the man grunted, chopping at him savagely. Tyrion barely got his shield up in ti
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow. The shattered pieces fell away from his arm. \'93Die!\'94 the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the temple so hard his head rang. The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the steel. The tall man grinned . . . until Tyrion\'92s destrier 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 it, quick as a snake, laying his cheek bare to the bone. Then he screamed. Tyrion buried his axe in his 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ead. \'93You die,\'94 he told him, and he did. \
As he wrenched the blade free, he heard a shout. \'91Eddard!\'94 a voice rang out. \'93For Eddard and Winterfell!
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  The knight came thundering down on him, swinging the spiked \
ball of a morningstar around his head. Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion cou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d so much as open his mouth to shout for Bronn. His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint. His ax
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  was gone, as fast as that. He clawed for his sword, but the morningstar was circling again, coming at his face. A sickening crunch, and he was falling. He did not recall hitting the ground, but w
\f3 hen he loo
\f1 ked up there was only sk
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  above him. He rolle
\f3 d onto his 
\f1 side and tried to find his feet, but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed. The knight who had felled him drew up above him. \'93Tyrion the Imp,\'94 he boomed down. \'93You are mine. Do you yield, Lannister?\'94 \
Yes, Tyrion thought, but the word caught in his throat. He made a croaking sound and fought his way to his knees, fumbling for a weapon. His sword, his dirk, anything . . . \
\'93Do you yield?\'94 The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse. Man and horse both seemed immense. The spiked ball swung in a lazy circle. Tyrion\'92s hands were numb,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his vision blurred, his scabbard 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 mpty. \'93Yield or die,\'94 the knight declared, his flail whirling faster and faster. \
Tyrion lurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse\'92s belly. The an
\f2\fs24 i
\f3\fs28 mal gave a 
\f1 hideous scream and re
\f3 ared. It tried to twist away fr
\f1 om the agony, a shower of blood and viscera poured d
\f2\fs24 o
\f1 \cf3 wn over T\cf2 yr\cf3 ion\'92s face, and th\cf2 e \cf3 horse
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 fell like\cf2  a\cf3 n avalanche. The n\cf2 ex\cf3 t he 
\f2 \cf2 k
\f1\fs28 new, his visor was packed with mu
\f2\fs24 d
\f0\b\fs38  and som
\f2\b0\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 thing was crushing his foot. He wriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. \'93 . . . yield . . . \'94 he managed to croak faintly. \
\'93Yes,\'94 a voice moaned, thick with pain. \
Tyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again. The horse had fallen away from him, onto its rider. The knight\'92s leg was trapped, the arm he\'92d used to break his fall twisted at 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  grotesque angle. \'93Yield,\'94 he repeated. Fumbling at his belt with his good hand, he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion\'92s feet. \'93I yield, my lord.\'94 \
Dazed, the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade. Pain hammered through his elbow when he moved his arm. The battle seemed to have moved beyond him. No one remained on his part of the field save a large number of corpses. Ravens were already circling and landing to feed. He saw that Ser Kevan had brought up his center in support of the van; his huge mass of pikemen had pus
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ed the northerners back against the hills. They were struggling on the slopes, pikes thrusting against another wall of shields, these oval and reinforced with iron studs. As he watched, the air filled with arrows again, and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire. \'93I believe you are losin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 , ser,\'94 he told the knight under the horse. The man made no reply. \
The sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl, though he could scarcely \
lift the sword he held for the agony in his elbow. Brorm reined up and looked down on him. \
\'93Small use you turned out to be,\'94 Tyrion told him. \
\'93It would seem you did well enough on your own,\'94 Bronn answered. \'93You\'92ve lost the spike off your helm, though.\'94 \
Tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm. The spike had snapped off clean. \'93I haven\'92t lost it. I know just where it is. Do you see my horse?\'94 \
By the time they found it, the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin\'92s reserve came sweeping up along 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he river. Tyrion watched his father fly past, the crimson-and- gold banner of Lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across the field. Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 oints of their lances. The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their charge. \
With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrio
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  made no attempt to join the slaughter. He and Bronn went looking for his men. Many he found among the dead. Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood, his arm gone at the elbow, a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him. Shagga was slump
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, Conn\'92s head in his lap. Tyrion thought they were both dead, but as he dismounted, Shagga opened his eyes and said, \'93They have killed Conn son of Coratt.\'94 Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast, where the spear thrust had killed him. When Bronn pulled Shagga
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to his feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time. He plucked them out one by one, cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather, and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh. Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they discovered looting the bodies of t
\f2\fs24 h
\f3\fs28 e slain with his Bu
\f1 rned Men. Of the three
\f3  hundred clansmen who had ridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister, perhaps half had survived. \
He left the living to look after the dea
\f1 d, sent Bronn to take charge of his captive knight, and went alone in search of his father. Lord Tywin was seated by the river, sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tenings on his breastplate. \'93A fine victory,\'94 Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion.
\f3  \'93Your wild men
\f1  fought well.\'94 \
His father\'92s eyes were on him, pale green flecked with gold, so cool they gave Tyrion a chill. \'93Did that surprise you, Father?\'94 he asked. \'93Did it upset your plans? We were supposed to be butchered, were we not?\'94 \
Lord Tywin drained his cup, his face expressionless. \'93I put the least disciplined men on \
the left, yes. I anticipated that they would break. Robb Stark is a green boy, more like to be brave than wise. I\'92d hoped that if he saw our left collapse
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  he might plunge into the gap, eager for
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a rout. Once he was fully committed, Ser Kevan\'92s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank, driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve.\'94 \
\'93And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage, yet keep me ignorant of your plans.\'94 \
\'93A feigned rout
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 is less convincing,\'94 his father said, \'93and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages.\'94 \
\'93A pity my savages r
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ined your da
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ce.\'94 Tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet and let it fall to the ground, wincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm. \
\'93The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years,\'94 Lord Tywin admitted, \'93but a victory is a victory. You appear to be wounded.\'94 \
Tyrion\'92s right arm was soaked with blood. \'93Good of you to notice, Father,\'94 he said through clenched teeth. \'93Might I trouble you to send for your maesters? Unless you relish the notion of having a one-armed dwarf for a son . . . \'94 \
An urgent shout of \'93Lord Tywin!\'94 turned his 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ather\'92s head before he could reply. Tywin Lannister rose to his feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his courser. The horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth. Ser Addam dropped to one knee, a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders, armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate. \'93My liege, we have taken some of their commanders. Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, four Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us.\'94 \
\'93And the boy?\'94 Lord Tywin asked. \
Ser Addam he
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 itated. \'93The Stark boy was not with them, my lord. They say he crossed at the Twin
\f2\fs24 s
\f3\fs28  with the great part of his ho
\f1 rse, riding hard for Riverrun.\'94 \
A green boy, Tyrion remembered, more like to be brave than wise. He would have laughed, if he hadn\'92t hurt so much. \

Moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley. Beneath the trees, warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist, leafy ground, while men made nervous jests in hushed voices. Now and again, she heard the chink of spears, the faint metallic slither of chain mail, but even those sounds were muffled. \
\'93It should not be long now, my lady,\'94 Hallis Mollen said. He had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come; it was his right, as Winterfell\'92s captain of guards, and Robb had not refused it to him. She had thirty men around her, charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if the fighting went against them. Robb had wanted fifty; Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough, that he would need every sword for the fig
\f2\fs24 h
\f3\fs28 t. They made their peac
\f1 e at thirty, nei
\f3 ther happy with it. \
\'93It will come when it comes,\'94 
\f2\fs24 C
\f1\fs28 atelyn told him. When it came, she knew it would mean death. Hal\'92s death perhaps . . . o
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  hers, or Robb\'92s. No one was safe. No life was certain. Catelyn was content to wait, to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook, to feel the warm wind in her hair. \
She was no stranger to waiting, after all. Her men 
\f2\fs24 h
\f3\fs28 ad always made 
\f1 her wait. \'93Watch for me, little cat,\'94 her father would always tell her, when he rode off to court or fai
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  or battle. And she would, s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 anding patiently on the battlements of Riverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by. He did not always come when he said he would, and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil, peering out between crenels and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hrough arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding, trotting along the rivershore toward the landing. \'93Did you watch for me?\'94 he\'92d ask when he bent to bug her. \'93Did you, little cat?\'94 \
Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well. \'93I shall not be long, my lady,\'94 he had vowed. \'93We will be wed on my return.\'94 Yet when the day came at last, it was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the sept. \
Ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with promis
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s on his lips. At least he had left her with more than words; he had \
given her a son. Nine moons had waxed and waned, and Robb had been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south. She had brough
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  him forth in blood and pain, not knowing whether Ned would ever see him. Her son. He had been so small . . . \
And now it was for Robb that she waited . . . for Robb, and for Jaime Lannister, the gilded knigh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  who men said had never learned to wait at all. \'93The Kingslayer is restless, and quick to anger,\'94 her 
\f3 uncl
\f1 e Brynden had told Robb. And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said. \
If Robb was frightened, he gave no si
\f2\fs24 g
\f3\fs28 n of 
\f1 it. Catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men, touching one on the shoulder, sharing a jest with another, helping a third to gentle an anxious horse. His armor clinked softly when he moved. 
\f2\fs24 O
\f3\fs28 nly h
\f1 is head was bare. Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair, so like her own, and wondered wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 n her
\f1  son had grown so big. Fifteen, and near as tall as she was. \
Let him grow tal
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 er, she asked the gods. Let him know sixteen, and twenty, and fifty. Let him grow as tall
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as his father, and hold his own son in his arm
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 . Please, please, please. As she watched him, this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels, all she could see was the babe they had laid at her breast at Riverrun, so long ago. \
The night was warm
\f3 , but the thought of Riverrun was
\f1  enough to make
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 her shiver. Where are they? s
\f1 he wondered. Could her uncle have been wrong? So much rested on the truth of what he had told them. Robb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men, and sent them ahead to screen his march. \'93Jaime does not know,\'94 Ser Brynden said when he rode back. \'93I\'92ll stake my life on that. No bird has reached him, my archers have seen to that. We\'92ve seen a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 few of his outriders, but those that saw us did not live to tell of it. He ought to have sent out more. He does not know.\'94 \
\'93How large is his host?\'94 her son asked. \
\'93Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between,\'94 her uncle said, with the craggy smile she remembered so well. \'93There is no other way
\f3  to besiege
\f1  Riverrun, yet still, that will be their undoing. Two or three thousand horse.\'94 \
\'93The Kingslayer has us three 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o one,\'94 said Galbart Glover.\
\'91True enough,\'94 Ser Brynden said, \'93yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks.\'94 \'93Yes?\'94 Robb asked. \
\'93Patience.\'94 \
Their host was greater than it had been when they left the Twins. Lord Jason Mallister had brought his power out from Seagard to join them as they swept around the headwaters of the Blue Fork and galloped south, and others had crept forth
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as well, hedge knights and small lords and masterless men-at-arms who had fled north when her brother Edmure\'92s army was shattered beneath the walls of Riverrun. They had driven their horses as hard as they dared to reach this place before Jaime Lannister had word of their coming, and now the hour was at hand. \
Catelyn watched her son mount up. Olyvar Frey held his horse for him, Lord Walder\'92s son, two years o
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 der than Robb, and ten years younger and more anxious. He strapped Robb
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s shield in place and handed up his helm. When he lowered it over the face she loved so well, a tall young knight
\f3  sat o
\f1 n his grey stallion where her son had been. It was dark among the trees, where the moon did not reach. When Robb turned his head to look at her, she could see only black inside his visor. \'93I must ride down the line, Mother,\'94 he told her. \'93Father says you should let the men see you before a battle.\'94 \
\'91Go, then,\'94 she said. \'93Let them see you.\'94 \'91It will give them courage,\'94 Robb said. \
And who will give 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e courage? she wondered, yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him. Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing his steps. Behind him his battle guard formed up. When he\'92d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors, she had insisted that he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed. Many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as they had taken to calling him. Torrhen Karstark and his brother E
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 dard were among his thirty, and Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than five of Walder Frey\'92s vast brood, along w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint. One of his companions was even a woman: Dacey Mormont, Lady Maege\'92s eldest daughter and heir to Bear Island, a lanky six-footer who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls. Some of the other lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints. \'93This is not about the honor of your houses,\'94 she told them. \'93This is abo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t keeping my son alive and whole.\'94 \
And if it comes to that, she wondered, will thirty be enough? Will six thousand be enough? \
A bird called faintly in t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e distance, a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand on \
Catelyn\'92s neck. Another bird answered; a third, a fourth. She knew their call well enough, from her years at Winterfell. Snow shrikes. Sometimes you saw them in the deep of winter, when the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 godswood was white and still. They were northern birds. \
They are coming, Catelyn thought.\
\'93They\'92re coming, my lady,\'94 Hal Mollen whispered. He was always a man for stating the \
obvious. \'93Gods be with us.\'94 \
She nodded as the woods grew still around 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem. In the quiet she could hear them, far off yet moving closer; the tread of many horses, the rattle of swords and spears and armor, the m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rmur of human voices, with here a laugh
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and there a curse. \
Eons seem
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d to come and go. The sounds grew louder. She heard more lau
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 hter, a shouted command, splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream. A horse snorted. A man swore. And then at last she saw him . . . only for an 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nstant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor, yet she knew it 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 as him. Even at a distance, Ser Jaime Lannister was unmistakable. The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and turned his
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 crimson cloak to black. He was not wearing a helm. \
He was there and he was gone again, his silver
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  armor obscured by the trees once more. Others came behin
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  him, long columns of them, knights and sworn swords and freeriders, three quarters of the Lannister horse. \
\'93He 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenter
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  build siege towers,\'94 Ser Brynden had promised. \'93He has ridden out with his k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ights thrice already, to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast.\'94 \
Nodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him. Ned had taught him to read maps. \'93Raid him here,\'94 he said, pointing. \'93A f
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w hu
\f3 ndred me
\f1 n, no more. Tully banners. When he comes after you, we will be waiting\'94\'97his finger moved an inch to the left\'97\'93here.\'94 \
Here was a hush in the night, moonlight and shadows, a thick carpet of dead
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 leaves underfoot, densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed, the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away. \
Here was her son on his stallion, glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute. \
Here was the call of Maege Mormont\'92s warhorn, a long low blast that rolled down the \
valley from the east, to tell them that the last of Jaime\'92s riders had enter
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the
\f3  trap
\f1 . \
And Grey Wind threw back his head and howled. \
The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark, and she found herself shivering. It was a terrible sound, a frightening sound, yet there was music in it too. For a second she felt something like pity for the Lannisters below. So this is what death sounds like, she thought. \
HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came th
\f3 e an
\f1 swer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded his own horn. To east and west, the trumpets of the Mallisters and Freys b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ew vengeance. North, where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow, Lord Kar
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tark\'92s warhorns added their own deep, mour
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ful voices to the dark chorus. Men were sho
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ting and horses rearing in the stream below. \
The whispering wood let out its breath all at once, as the bow
\f2\fs24 m
\f1 \cf3 en Robb h\cf2 ad\cf3  hidden in the bra\cf2 nc\cf3 hes o
\f2 \cf2 f
\f1 \cf3  the tree\cf2 s \cf3 let fly their arro\cf2 ws\cf3  and 
\f2 \cf2 t
\f0\b\fs38 he night 
\f2\b0\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rupted with the screams of men and horses. All around her, the riders raised their lances, and the dirt and leaves that ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel. \'93Winterfell!\'94 she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again. He moved away from her at a trot, leading his men downhill. \
Catelyn sat on her horse, unmoving, with Hal Mollen and her guard around her, and she waited as she had 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 aited before, for Brando
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  and Ned and her father. She was high on the ridge, and the trees hid most of what
\f3  was going
\f1  on beneath her. A heartbeat, two, four, and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone in the wood. The rest were melted away into the green. \
Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon\'92s riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees. They were in a long line, an endless line, and as they burst from the wood there was an instant, the smallest part of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the point
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  of their lances, as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame. \
Then she blinked, and they were only men, rushing down to kill o
\f3 r die
\f1 . \
Afterward, she could not claim she had seen the battle. Yet she could hear, and the valley rang with echoes. The crack of a broken lance, the clash of swords, the cries of \'93Lannister\'94 and \'93Winterfell\'94 and \'93Tully! Riverrun and Tully!\'94 When she realized there was no more to see, she closed her eyes and listened. The battle cam
\f3 e ali
\f1 ve around her. She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, the hiss of arrows, the thunder of \
drums, the terri
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ied screaming of a thousand horses. Men shouted curses and begged for mercy, and got it (or not), and lived (or died). The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound. Once she heard Robb\'92s voice, as clear as if he\'92d been standing at her side, calling, \'93To me! To me!\'94 And she heard his direwolf, snarling and growling, heard the snap of those long teeth, the tearing of flesh, shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike. Was there only one wolf? It was hard to be certain. \
Little by little, the sounds dwindled and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 died, until at last there was only the wolf. As a red
\f3  daw
\f1 n broke in the east, Grey Wind began to howl again. \
Robb came back to her on a different horse, riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion he had taken down into the valley
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  The wolf\'92s head on his shield was slashed half to pieces, raw wood showing where deep gouges had been hacked i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  the oak, but Robb himself seemed unhurt. Yet when he came closer, Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with b
\f3 lood.
\f1  \'93You\'92re hurt,\'94 she said. \
Robb lifted his hand, 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 pened and closed his fingers. \'93No,\'94 he said. \'93This is . . . Torrhen\'92s blood, perhaps, or . . . \'94 He shook his head. \'93I do not know.\'94 \
A mob of men followed him up the slo
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 e, dirty and dented and grinning, with Theon and the Greatjon at their head. Between them they dragged Ser
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Jaime Lannister. They threw him down in front of her horse. \'93The Kingslayer,\'94 Hal announced, unnecessarily. \
Lannister raised his head. \'93Lady Stark,\'94 he said from his knees. Blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp, but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair. \'93I 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ould
\f3  off
\f1 er you my sword, but I seem to have mislaid it.\'94 \
\'93It is not your sword I want, ser,\'94 she told him. \'93Give me my father and my brother Edmure. Give me my daughters. Give me my lord husband.\'94 \
\'93I have mislaid them as wel
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 , I fear.\'94 \
\'93A pity,\'94 Catelyn said coldly. \
\'93Kill him, Robb,\'94 Theon Greyjo
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  urged. \'93Take his head off.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 her son answered, peeling off his bloody glove. \'93He\'92s more use alive th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n dead. And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle.\'94 \
\'93A wise m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n,\'94 Jaime Lannister said, \'93and honorable.\'94 \'93Take him away and put him in irons,\'94 Catelyn said. \
\'93Do as my
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 lady mother says,\'94 Robb commanded, \'93and make certain there\'92s a s
\f3 trong gu
\f1 ard
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 around him. Lord Karstark will want his head on a pike.\'94 \
\'93That he will,\'94 the Greatjon agreed, gesturing. Lannister was led away to be bandaged and chained. \
\'93Why shoul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  Lord Karstark want him dead?\'94 Catel
\f3 yn a
\f1 sked. \
Robb looked away into the woods, with the
\f3  same br
\f1 ooding look tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  Ned often got. \'93He . . . he killed them . . . \'94 \
\'93Lord Karstark\'92s sons,\'94 Galbart Glover explained. \
\'93Both of them,\'94 said Robb. \'93Torrhen and Eddard. And Dar
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 n Hornwood as well.\'94 \
\'93No one can fault Lannister on h
\f3 is co
\f1 urage,\'94 Glover said. \'93When he saw 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat he was lost, he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley, ho
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ing to reach Lord Robb and cut him down. And almost did.\'94 \
\'93He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark\'92s neck, after he took Torrhen\'92s hand off and split Daryn Hornwood\'92s skull open,\'94 Robb said. \'93All the time he was shouting for me. If they hadn\'92t tried to stop him\'97\'94 \
\'93\'97I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark,\'94 Catelyn said. \'93Your men did what they were sworn to do, Robb. They died protecting their liege lord. Grieve for them. Honor them for their valor. But not now. You have no time for grief. You may have lopped the head off the snake, but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my father\'92s castle. We have won a battle, not a war.\'94 \
\'93But such a battle!\'94 said Theon Greyjoy eagerly. \'93My lady, the realm
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 has not seen such a victory since the Field of Fire. I vow, the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell. We\'92ve taken close to a hundred knights captive, and a dozen lords bannermen. Lord Westerling, Lord Banefort, Ser Garth Greenfield, Lord Estren, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishman . . . 
\f3 and t
\f1 hree Lannisters besides Jaime, Lord Tywin\'92s own nephews, two of his sister\'92s sons and one of his dead 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 rother\'92s . . . \'94 \
\'93And Lord Tywin?\'94 Catelyn interrupted. \'93Have you perc
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ance taken Lord Tywin, 
\f3 Theon
\f1 ?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Greyjoy answered, brought up short. \
\'93Until you do, this war is far from done.\'94 \
Robb raised his head and pushed his hair back out
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 f his ey

DAENERYS 
\f1 \
The flies circled Khal Drogo slowly, their wings buzzing, a low thrum at the edge of hearing t
\f3 hat f
\f1 illed Dany with dread. \
The sun was high and pitiless. Heat shimmered in waves off the ston
\f3 y out
\f1 crops of low hills. A thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between Dany\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  swollen breasts. The only sounds were the steady clop of their horses\'92 hooves, the rhyt
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 mic tingle of the bells in Drogo\'92s hair, and the distant voices behind them. \
Dany watched the flies. \
They we
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e as large as bees, gross, purplish, glistening. The Dothraki called them bloodflies. They lived in marshes and stagnant pools, sucked blood from man and horse alike, and laid their eggs in the dead and dying. Drogo hated them. Whenever one came near him, his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around it. She had never seen him miss. He would 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 old the fly inside his huge fist l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng enough to hear its frantic buzzing. Then his fingers would tighten, and when he opened his hand again, the fly would be only a red smear on his palm. \
Now one crept across the rump of his stallion, and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it away. The others flitted about Drogo, closer and closer. The khal did not react. His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills, the reins loose in his hands. Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  wound on his breast. The herbwomen had made it for him. Mirri Maz Duur\'92s p
\f3 oultice 
\f1 had itched and burned, and he had torn it off six days ago,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 cursing her for a maegi. The mud plaster was more soothing, and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well. He\'92d been drinking it heavily these past three days; when 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 t was not poppy wine, it was fermented mare\'92s milk or pepper beer. \
Yet he scarcely touched his food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night. Dany could see how drawn his face had become. Rhaego was restless in her belly, kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir Drogo\'92s interest as it had. Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep. An
\f3 d now th
\f1 is silence. It was making her afraid. Since they had moun
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed up at dawn, he had said not a word. When she spoke, she got no answer but
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a grunt, and not even that much since midday. \
One of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khal
\f2\fs24 \'92
\f1\fs28 s shoulder. Another, circling, touched down on his neck and crept up toward his mouth. Khal Drogo swayed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the saddle, bells ringing, as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace. \
Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer. \'93My lord,\'94 she said softly. \'93Drogo. My sun-and-stars.\'94 \
He did not seem to hear. The bloodfly crawled up under
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his drooping mustache and settled on his cheek, in the crease beside his nose. Dany gasped, \'93Drogo.\'94 Clumsily she reached over and touched his arm. \
Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from his horse. The flies scattered for a heartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him wher
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  he lay. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany said, reining up. Heedless of her belly for once, she sc
\f3 ra
\f1 mbled off her silver and ran to him. \
The grass beneath him was brown and dry. Drogo cr
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ed out in pain as Dany
\f3  knel
\f1 t beside him. His breath rat
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 led harshly in his thr
\f3 oat, an
\f1 d he looked at her without recognition. \'93My horse,\'94 he gasped. Dany brushed the flies off his chest, smashing one as he would have. His skin bu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ned beneath her fingers. \
The k
\f3 hal\'92s blo
\f1 odriders had been following just behind them. She heard Haggo shout as they galloped up. Cohollo vaulted from his horse. \'93Blood of my blood,\'94 he said as he dropped to his knees. The oth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r two kept to their mounts. \
\'93No,\'94 Khal 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 rogo groaned, struggling in Dany\'92s arms. \'93Must ride. Ride. No.\'94 \
\'93He fell from his horse,\'94 Haggo said, staring down. His broad face was impassive, but his voice was leaden. \
\'93You must not say that,\'94 Dany told him. \'93We 
\f3 have
\f1  ridden far enough today. W
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  will camp here.\'94 \
\'93Here?\'94 Haggo looked around them. The land was brown and sere, inhospitable. \'93This is no camping ground.\'94 \
\'93It is not for a woman to bid us halt,\'94 said Qoth
\f3 o, \'93not 
\f1 even a khaleesi.\'94 \
\'93We camp here,\'94
\f3  Dany
\f1  repeated. \'93Haggo, t
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll them Khal Drogo commanded the halt. If any ask why, say to them that my time is near and I could not continue. Cohollo, bring \
up the slaves, they must put up the khal\'92s tent at once.
\f3  Qot
\f1 ho\'97\'94 \'93You do not command me, Khalee
\f3 si,\'94 Qoth
\f1 o said. \
\'93Find Mirri Maz Duur,\'94 she told him. The godswife would be walking among the other Lamb Men, in the long column of slaves. \'93Bring her to me, with he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  chest.\'94 \
Qotho glared do
\f3 wn a
\f1 t her, his eyes hard as flint. \'93The maegi.\'94 He spat. \'93This I wi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l not do.\'94 \
\'93You will,\'94 Dany said, \'93or when Drogo wakes, he will hear why you defied me.\'94 \
Furious, Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger . . . but Dany k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ew he would return with Mirri Maz Duur, however little he might like it. The slaves ere
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 ted Khal Drogo\'92s tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun. Even so, it was stifling under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside. Thick patterned carpets had been laid down over 
\f3 the g
\f1 round, and pillows scattered in the corners. Eroe
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 , the timid girl Dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the La
\f3 mb M
\f1 en, set up a brazier. They stretched Drogo out on a woven mat. \'93No,\'94 he muttered in the Common Tongue. \'93No, no.\'94 It was all he said, all he seemed capable of saying. \
Doreah unhooked
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings, while Jhiqui knelt by his feet to undo the laces of his riding sandals. Irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze, but Dany forbade it. She would not have any see Drogo this way, in delirium and weakness. When her khas came up, she posted them outside at g
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ard. \'93Admit no one without my leave,\'94 she told Jhogo. \'93No one.\'94 \
Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay. \'93He dies,\'94 she w
\f3 hispered
\f1 . \
Dany slapped her. \'93The khal cannot die. He is the father of the stallion who mounts the world. His hair has never been cut. He still wears the bells his father gave him.\'94 \
\'93Khaleesi, \'93 Jhiqui said, \'93he fell from his horse.\'94 \
Trembling, her eyes full of sudden tears, Dany turned away from them. He fell from his horse! It was so, she had seen it, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the bloodriders, and no doubt her handmaids and the men of her khas as well. An
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  how many more? They
\f3  coul
\f1 d not keep it secret, and Dany knew what that meant. A khal who could not ride could not rule, and Drogo had fallen from his horse. \
\'93We m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 s
\f3 t bathe 
\f1 him,\'94 she said st
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 bbornly. She must not allow herself to despair. \'93Irri, \
have t
\f3 he tu
\f1 b brought at once. Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, he\'92s so hot.\'94 He was a fire in human skin. \
The slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent. When Doreah brought the first jar of water, Dany wet a length of silk to lay across Drogo\'92s brow, over the burning skin. His eyes looked at her, but he did not see. When his lips opened, no words escaped them, only a moan. \'93Where is Mirri Maz Duur?\'94 she demanded, her patien
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e rubbed raw with fear. \
\'93Qotho will find her,
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Irri said. \
Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening it with jars
\f3  o
\f1 f bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves. While the bath w
\f3 as be
\f1 ing prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly besi
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 e her lord husband, her belly great with their child within. She undid his braid with a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 xious fingers, as she had on the night he\'92d tak
\f3 en her f
\f1 or the first time, beneath the stars. His bells she laid aside carefully, one by one. He would
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 want them again when he was well, she told herself. \
A breat
\f3 h of air
\f1  entered the tent as Aggo poked h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s head through the si
\f3 lk. 
\f1 \'93Khaleesi, \'93 he said, \'93the Andal is come, and be
\f3 gs leave
\f1  to enter.\'94 \
\'93The Andal\'94 was what the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Dothraki c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lled Ser Jorah. \'93Yes,\'94 she said, rising clumsily, \'93send him in.\'94 She trusted the knight. He would know what to do if anyone did. \
Ser Jorah Mormont ducked through the 
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 oor flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dimness. In the fierce heat of the south, he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed rid
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng sandals that laced up to his knee. His scabbard hung f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om a twisted horsehair belt. Under a bleached white vest, he was bare-chested, skin reddened by th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  sun. \'93Talk goes from mouth to ear, all over the khalasa
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 he said. \'93It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse.\'94 \
\'93Help him,\'94 Dany pleaded. \'93For the love you say you bear me, help him now.\'94 \
The knight knelt beside her. He looked at Drogo long and hard, and
\f3  the
\f1 n at Dany. \'93Send your maids away.\'94 \
Wordlessly, her throat tight with fear, Dany made a gesture. Irri herded
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the other girls from the tent. \
When they were alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delic
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 cy surprising in such a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 d from Drogo\'92s chest. The plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the Lamb Men, and like \
those walls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry mud with his knife, pried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul, sweet smell rose from t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were crusted with blood and pus, Dro
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 o\'92s breast black and glistening with corruption. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks. \'93No, please, gods hear me, no.\'94 Khal Drogo thrashed, fighting some unseen enemy. Black blood ran slow and thick from \
his open wound.\
\'93Your khal is good as dead, Princess.\'94 \
\'93No, he can\'92t die, he mustn\'92t, it was only a cut.\'94 Dany to
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 k his large callused hand in her own small ones, and held it tight between them. \'93I will not let him die . . . \'94 \
Ser Jorah gave a bitter laugh. \'93Khaleesi or queen, that command is beyond your power. Save your tears, child. Weep for him tomorrow, or a year from now. We do not have time for grief. We must go, and quickly, before he dies.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 Dany was lost. \'93Go? Where should we go?\'94 \
\'93Ass
\f3 hai, I
\f1  would s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 y. It lies far to the south, at the end
\f3  of th
\f1 e known world, yet men say it is a grea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  port. We will find a shi
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28  to take us 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ack to Pentos. It will be a hard jo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 rney, make no mistake. Do you trust your khas? Will they come with us?\'94 \
\'93Khal Drogo comman
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ed them to keep me safe,\'94 Dany replied uncertainly, \'93but if he dies . . . \'94 She touched the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 well of her belly. \'93I don\'92t understand. Why should we flee? I am khaleesi. I carry Drogo\'92s heir
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  He will be khal after Drogo . . . \'94 \
Ser Jorah frowned. \'93Princess, hear me. The Dothraki will not follow a suckling babe. Drogo\'92s strength was what they bowed to, and only that. When he is gone, Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos will fight for his place, and this khalasa
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  will devour itself. The winner will want no mor
\f3 e rivals
\f1 . The boy will be taken from your breas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  the
\f3  momen
\f1 t he is born. They will give him to the dogs . . . \'94 \
Dany hugged herself. \'93But why?\'94 she cried plaintively. \'93Why should they kill a little baby?\'94 \
\'93He is 
\f2\fs24 D
\f1\fs28 rogo\'92s son, and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world. It was prophe
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ied. Better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood.\'94 \
The child kicked inside her, as if he had heard. Dany remembered the story Viserys had \
told her, of what the Usurper\'92s dogs had done to Rhaegar\'92s ch
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ldren. His son had been a babe as well, yet they had ripped him from his mother\'92s breast and dashe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  his head against a wall. That was
\f3  the 
\f1 way of men. \'93They must not hurt my son!\'94 she cried. \'93I will order my khas to keep him safe, and Drogo\'92s bloodriders will\'97\'94 \
Ser Jorah held her by the shoulders. \'93A bloo
\f3 drider d
\f1 ies with his khal. You know that, child. They will take you to
\f3  Vaes
\f1  Do
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hrak, to the crones, that is
\f3  the
\f1  last duty they owe him in life . . . when it is done, they will
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 join D
\f3 rogo in 
\f1 the night lands.\'94 \
Dany did not want to go back to Vaes Dothrak and live the rest of her life among those terrible old women, yet she knew that the knight spoke the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 truth. Drogo had been more than her sun-and-stars; he had been the shield that kept her safe. \'93I 
\f3 will 
\f1 not leave him,\'94 she said stubbornly, miserably. She took his hand again. \'93I will not.\'94 \
A stirring at the tent flap made Dany turn her head. Mirri Maz Duur entered, bowing low. Days on the march, trailing behind the khalasar, had left her limping and haggard, with blistered and bleeding feet and hollows under her eye
\f3 s. Beh
\f1 ind her came Qotho and Haggo, carrying the godswife\'92s chest between them. When the bloodriders caught sight of Drogo\'92s wound, the chest slipped from Haggo\'92s fingers and crashed to the flo
\f3 or of
\f1  the tent, and Qotho swore an oath so foul it seared the air. \
Mirri Maz Duur studied Drogo, her face still and dead. \'93The wound has festered.\'94 \
\'93This is your work,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 maegi,\'94 Qotho said. Haggo laid his fist across Mirri\'92s cheek with a meaty smack that drove her to the ground. Then he kicked her 
\f3 where she la
\f1 y. \
\'93Stop it!\'94 Dany screamed. \
Qotho pulled Haggo away, saying, \'93Kicks are too merciful for a maegi. Take he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  outside. We will stake her to the earth, to be the mount of every passing man. And when they are done with her, the dogs will use her as well. Weasels will tear out her entrail
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  and carrion crows feast upon her eyes. The flies off the river shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts . . . \'94 He dug
\f3  iron
\f1 -hard fingers into the soft, wobbly flesh under the godswife\'92s arm and hauled her to her feet. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany said. \'93I will not have her harmed.\'94 \
Qotho\'92s li
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 s skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile. \'93No? You say me no? Better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi. You did this, as much as the other.\'94 \
Ser Jorah stepped between them, loosening his longsword in its scabbard. \'93Rein in your \
tongue, bloo
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 rider. The princess is still your khaleesi. \'93\
\'93Only while the blood-of-my-blood still lives,\'94 Qotho told the knight. \'93W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en he dies, she \
is nothing.\'94\
Dany felt a tightness inside her. \'93Before I was khaleesi, I was the blood of the dragon. \
Ser Jorah, summon my khas.\'94\
\'93No,\'94 said Qotho. \'93W
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  will go. For now . . . Khaleesi. \'93 Haggo followed him from the tent, \
scowling. \
\'93That one means you no good, Princess,\'94 Mormont said. \'93The Do
\f3 thraki say a man and
\f1  his bloodriders share one life, and Qotho sees it e
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ding. A dead man is beyond fear.\'94 \
\'93No one has died,\'94 Dany said. \'93S
\f3 er Jorah,
\f1  I may have need of your blade. Best go don your armor.\'94 She was more frightened than she dared admit, even to herself. \
The knight bowed. \'93As you say.\'94 He strode from the tent. \
Dany turned back to Mirri Maz Duur. The woman\'92s eyes were wary. \'93So you have saved me once more.\'94 \
\'93And now you must save him,\'94 Dany said. \'93Please . . . \'94 \
\'93You do not ask a slave,\'94 Mirri replied sharply, \'93you tell her.\'94 She went to Drogo burning on his mat, and gazed long at his wound. \'93Ask or tell, it makes no matter. He is beyond a healer\'92s skills.\'94 The khal\'92s eyes were closed. She opened one with her f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ngers. \'93He has been d
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 lling the hurt with milk of the poppy.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Dany admitted.\
\'93I made him a poultice of firepod and sti
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g-me-not and bound it in a lambskin.\'94 \
\'93It burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen made him a new one, wet and soothing.\'94 \
\'93It burned, yes
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  There is great healing magic in fire, even your hairless men know that.\'94 \'93Make him another poultice,\'94 Dany begged. \'93This time I will make certain he wears it.\'94 \'93The time for that is past, my lady,\'94 Mirri said. \'93All I can do now is ease the dark road \
before him,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 so he might ride painless to the night lands. He will be gone by morning.\'94 \
Her words were a knife
\f3  through Da
\f1 ny\'92s breast. What ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  she ever done to make the gods so cruel? She had finally found a safe place, had finally tasted love and hope. She was finally going home. And now to lose it all 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . . \'93
\f3 No,\'94 
\f1 she pleaded. \'93Save 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 i
\f3 m, an
\f1 d I will free you, I swear it. You must know a way . . . some magic, some . . . \'94 \
Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied Daenerys through eyes as black as night.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93There is a spe
\f3 ll.\'94 
\f1 Her voice was quiet, scarcely more than a whisper. \'93But it is h
\f3 ard, l
\f1 ady, and dark. Some wou
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for the lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.\'94 \
Dany went cold all over. \'93Then you truly are a maegi . . . \'94 \
\'93Am I?
\f3 \'94 Mi
\f1 rri Maz Duur s
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 iled. \'93Only a maegi can save your rider now, Silver Lady.\'94 \
\'93Is there no other way?\'94 \
\'93No other.\'94 \
Khal Drogo gave a shuddering gasp. \
\'93Do it,\'94 Dany blurt
\f3 ed. Sh
\f1 e must not be afraid; she was the blood of the dragon. \'93Save him.\'94 \
\'93There is a price,\'94 the godswife warned her. \'93You\'92ll have gold, horses, whatever you like.\'94 \
\'93It is not a matter of gold or
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 horses. This is bloodmagic, lady
\f3 . Only de
\f1 ath may pay for life.\'94 \
\'93Death?\'94 Dany wrapped her arms around herself protec
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ively, rocked back and forth
\f3  on he
\f1 r heels. \'93My death?\'94 She told herself she would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would not be afraid. Her brother Rhaegar had died for the woman he loved. \
\'93No,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur promised. \'93Not your death, Khaleesi.\'94 Dany trembled with relief. \'93Do it.\'94 \
The maegi nodded solemnly. \'93As you speak, so it shall be done. Call your serva
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ts.\'94 Khal Drogo writhed
\f3  feebl
\f1 y as Rakharo and Quaro lowered him into the bath. \'93No,\'94 he \
muttered, \'93no. Must ride.\'94 Once in the water, all the strength seemed to leak out of him. \
\'93Bring his horse,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur commanded, and so it was done
\f3 . Jhogo
\f1  led the great red stallion into the tent. When the animal caught the scent of death, he screamed and reared, rolling his eyes. It took three men to subdue him. \
\'93What do you mean to do?\'94 Dany asked her.\
\'93We need the blood,\'94 Mirri answered. \'93That is the way.\'94 \
Jhogo edged back, his hand on his arakh. He was a youth of sixteen years, whip-thin, fearless, quick to laugh, with the faint shadow of his first mustachio on his upper lip. He
\f3  fell 
\f1 to his knees before her. \'93Khaleesi, \'93 he pleaded, \'93you must not do this thing. Let me kill this maegi.\'94 \
\'93Kill her and you kill your khal,\'94 Dany said. \'93This is bloodmagic,\'94 he said. \'93It i
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  forbidden.\'94 \
\'93I am khaleesi, and I say it is not forbidden. In Vaes Dothrak, Khal Drogo slew a stallion and I ate his h
\f3 eart, 
\f1 to give our son strength and courage. This is the sa
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e. The same.\'94 \
The stallion kicked and reared as Rakharo, Quaro, and Aggo pulled him close to the tub where the khal floated like one already dead, pus and blood seeping from his wound to stain the bathwaters. Mirri Maz Duur chanted words in a tongue that Dany did not know, and a knife appeared in 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er hand. Dany never saw where it came from. It looked old; hammered red bronze, leaf-shaped, its blade covered with ancient glyphs. The maegi drew it across the stallion\'92s throat, under the noble
\f3  head,
\f1  and the hors
\f3 e scre
\f1 amed and shuddered as the blood poured out of him in a red rush. He would have collapsed, but the men of her khas held him up. \'93Strength of the mount, go into the rider,\'94 Mirri sang as horse blood swirled int
\f3 o the 
\f1 waters of Drogo\'92s bath. \'93Strength of the beast, go into the man.\'94 \
Jhogo looked terrified as he struggled with the stallion\'92s weight, afraid to touch the dead flesh, yet afraid to let go as well. Only a horse, Dany thought. If she could buy Drogo\'92s life with the death of a horse, she would pay a thousand times over. \
When they let the stallion fall, the bath was a dark red, and nothing showed of Drogo but his face. Mirri Maz Duur had no use for the carcass. \'93Burn it,\'94 Dany told them. It was \
what they did, she knew. When a man died, his mount was killed and placed beneath him on the funeral pyre, to c
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rry him to the night lands. The men of her khas dragged the carcass from the tent. The blood had gone everywhere. Even the sandsilk walls were spotted with red, and the rugs underfoot were black and wet. \
Braziers were lit. Mirri Maz Duur tossed 
\f3 a red po
\f1 wder onto the coals. It gave the smoke a spicy scent, a pleasant enough smell, yet Eroeh fled sobbing, and Dany was filled with fear. But she had gone too far to turn back now. She sent her handmaids away. \'93Go with them, Silver Lady,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur told her. \
\'93I will stay,\'94 Dany said. \'93The man took me under th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  stars and gave life to the child inside me. I will not leave him.\'94 \
\'93You must. Once I
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 begin to sing, no one must enter this tent. My song will wake powers old and dark. The dead will dance here this night. No living man must look on them.\'94 \
Dany bowed her head, he
\f3 lpless. \'93No one will ent
\f1 er.\'94 She bent over the tub, over Drogo in his bath of blood, and kissed him lightly on the brow. \'93Bring him back to me,\'94 she whispered to Mirri Maz Duur before she fled. \
Outside, the sun was low on the horizon, the sky a bruised red. The khalasar h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d made camp. Tents and sleeping mats were scattered as far as the eye could see. A hot wind blew. Jhogo and Aggo were digging a firep
\f3 it to
\f1  burn the dead stallion. A crowd had gathered to stare
\f3  at D
\f1 any
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with hard black eyes, th
\f3 eir faces like masks of b
\f1 eaten copper. She saw Ser Jorah Mormont, wearing mail and leather now, sweat beading on his broad, balding forehead. He pushed his way through the Dothraki to Dany\'92s side. When he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the ground, the color seemed to drain from his face. \'93What have you done, you little fool?\'94 he asked hoarsely. \
\'93I had to save him.\'94 \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 We could have fled,\'94 he said. \'93I would have seen you safe to Asshai, Princess. There was no nee
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  . . . \'94 \
\'93Am I truly your princess?\'94 sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28  a
\f1 sked him. \'93You know you are, gods save us both.\'94\
\'93Then help me now.\'94\
Ser Jorah grimaced. \'93Would that I knew how.\'94 \
Mirri Maz Duur\'92s voice rose to a high, ululating wail that sent a shive
\f3 r down Dan
\f1 y\'92s back. Some of the Dothraki began to mutter and back away. The tent was agl
\f3 ow with the 
\f1 light of brazi
\f3 ers within. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 rough the blood-spattered sandsilk, she
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 glimpsed \cf2 sh\cf3 adows moving. \
Mi\cf2 rr\cf3 i Maz
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 Duur was \cf2 da\cf3 ncing, and not alo\cf2 ne\cf3 .\
Da
\f2 \cf2 n
\f0\b\fs38 y saw
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 naked fear on the faces of the Dothraki. \'93This must not be,\'94 Qotho thundered. \
She had not seen the bloodrider return. Haggo and Cohollo were with him. They had brought the hairless men, the eunuchs who healed with knife and needle and fire. \
\'93This will be,\'94 Dany replied. \
\'93Maegi, \'93 Haggo growled. And old Cohollo\'97Cohollo who had bound h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s life to Drogo\'92s on the day of his birth, Cohollo who had always been kind to her\'97Cohollo spat full in her face. \
\'93You will die, maegi,\'94 Qotho promised, \'93but the other must die first.\'94 He drew his arakh and made for the tent. \
\'93No,\'94 she shouted, \'93you mustn\'92t.\'94 She caught him by the shoulde
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 , but Qotho shoved her aside. Dany fell to
\f3  her
\f1  k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ees, crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within. \'93Stop him,\'94 she commanded her khas, \'93kill him.\'94 \
Rakharo and Quaro stood beside the tent flap. Quaro took a step forward, reaching for the ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 dle of his whip, but Qotho spun graceful as a dancer, the curved arakh rising. It caught Quaro low under the arm, the bright sharp steel biting up through leather and skin, through muscle and rib bone. Blood fountained as the young rider reeled backward, gasping. \
Qotho wrenched the blade fr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 e. \'93Horselord,\'94 Ser Jorah Mormont called. \'93Try me.\'94 His longsword slid from its scabbard. \
Qot
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 o whirled, cursing. The arakh moved so fast that Quaro\'92s blood flew from it in a fine spray, like ra
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 n in a hot wind. The longsword caught it a foot from S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Jorah\'92s face, and held it quivering for an instant as Qotho howled in fury. The knight was clad in chainmail, with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and a heavy gorget around his throat, but he had
\f3  not t
\f1 hought to don his helm. \
Qotho danced backward, arakh whirling around his head in a shining blur, flickering out like lightning as the knight came on in a rush. Ser Jorah parried as best he could, but the \
slashes came so fast that it seemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms. 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 he heard the crunch of sword on mai
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 , saw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet. Suddenly it was Mormont stumbling backward, and Qotho leaping to the attack. The left side of the knight\'92s face ran red with blood, and a cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping. Qotho screamed taunts at him, calling him a craven, a milk man, a eunuch in an iron suit. \'93You die now!\'94 he promised, arakh shivering through the red twilight. Inside Dany\'92s womb, her son kicked wildly. The curved blade slipped past the straight one and bit deep into the knight\'92s hip where the mail gaped open. \
Mormont grunted, stumbled. Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly, a wetness on her thighs. Qotho shrieked triumph, but his arakh had found bone, and for half a heartbeat it caught. \
It was enough. Ser Jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left him, through flesh
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and muscle and bone, and Qotho\'92s forearm dangled loose, flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew. The knight\'92s next cut was at the Dothraki\'92s ear, so savage that Qotho\'92s face seemed alm
\f3 ost to
\f1  explode. \
The Dothraki were shouting, Mirri Maz Duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human, Quaro pleading for water as he died. Dany cried out for help, but no one heard. Rakharo was fighting Haggo, ara
\f3 kh danc
\f1 ing with arakh until Jhogo\'92s whip cracked, loud as thunder, the lash coiling around Haggo\'92s throat. A yank, and the bloodrider stumbled backward, losing his feet and his sword. Ra
\f3 kharo 
\f1 sprang forward, howling, swinging his arakh down with both hands through the t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 p of Haggo\'92s head. The point caught between his eyes, red and quivering. Someone threw a stone, and when Dany looked, her shoulder was torn and bloody. \'93No,\'94 she wept, \'93no, please, stop it, it\'92s too high, the price is too high.\'94 More stones came flying. She tried to crawl toward the tent, but Cohollo caug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t her. Fingers in her hair, he pulled her head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat. \'93My baby,\'94 she screamed, and perhaps the gods heard, for as quick as that, Cohollo was dead. Aggo\'92s arrow took him under the arm, to pierce his lungs and heart. \
When at last Daenerys found the strength to raise her head, she saw the crowd dispersing, the Dothraki stealing silently
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back to their tents and sleeping mats. Some were saddling horses and riding off. The sun had set. Fires burned throughout the khalasar, great orange blazes that crackled with fury and spit embers at the sky. She tried to rise, and agony seized her and squeezed her like a giant\'92s fist. The breath went out of her; it was all she could do to gasp. The sound of Mirri Maz Duur\'92s voice was like a funeral dirge. Inside the tent, the shadows whirled. \
An arm went under her waist, and then Ser Jorah was lifting her off her feet. His face \
was sticky with blood, and Dany saw that half his ear was gone. She convulsed in his arms as the pain took her again, and heard
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the knight shouting for her handmaids to help him. Are they all so afraid? She knew the answer. Another pain grasped her, and Dany bit back a scream. It felt as if her son had a knife in each hand, as if he were hacking
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 at her to cut his way out. \'93Doreah, curse you,\'94 Ser Jorah roared. \'93Come here. Fetch the birthing women.\'94 \
\'93They will not come. They say she is accursed.\'94\
\'93They\'92ll come or I\'92ll have their heads.\'94\
Doreah wept. \'93They are gone, my lord.\'94\
\'93The maegi,\'94 someone else said. Was that Aggo? \'93Take her to the maegi.\'94 \
No, Dany wanted to say, no, not that, you mustn\'92t, but when
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she opened her mouth, a long wail of pain escaped, and the sweat broke over her skin. What was wrong with them, couldn\'92t they see? Inside the tent the shapes were dancing, circling the brazier and the bloody bath, dark against the sandsilk, and some did not look human. She glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf, and another like a man wreathed in flames. \
\'93The Lamb Woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed,\'94 Irri said. \'93She said so, I heard her.\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Doreah agreed, \'93I heard her too.\'94 \
No, she shouted, or perhaps she only thought it, for no whisper of sound escaped her lips. She was being carried. Her eyes opened to gaz
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  up at a flat dead sky, black and bleak and starless. Please, no. The sound of Mirri Maz Duur\'92s voice grew louder, until it filled the world. The shapes! she screamed. The dancers! \
Ser Jorah carried her inside the tent. \

ARYA \
The scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the Street of Flour was sweeter than any perfume Arya had ever smelled. She took a deep breath and stepp
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d closer to the pigeon. It was a plump one, speckled brown, busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones, but when Arya\'92s shadow touched it, it took to the air. \
Her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground, and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers. She was on it in the blink of an eye, grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered. It pecked at her hand. She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap. \
Compared with catching cats, pigeons were easy. \
A passing septon was looking at her askance. \'93Here\'92s the best place to find pigeon,\'94 Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword. \'93They come for the crumbs.\'94 He hurried away. \
She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street. A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberri
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s and lemons and apricots. Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise. \'93Could I have one?\'94 she heard herself say. \'93A lemon, or . . . or any kind.\'94 \
The pushcart man looked her up and down. Plainly he did not like what he saw. \'93Three coppers.\'94 \
Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot. \'93I\'92ll trade you a fat pigeon,\'94 she said. \
\'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Others take your pigeon,\'94 the pushcart man said. \
The tarts were still warm from the oven. The smells were ma
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ing her mouth water, but she did not have three coppers . . . or one. She gave the pushcart man a look, remembering what Syrio had told her about seeing. He was short, with a little round belly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little. She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said, \'93You be keepin\'92 your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving \
little gutter rats, that 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hey do.\'94 \
Arya glanced warily behind her. Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley. Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; their mail and boots and gloves were black. One wore a longsword at his hip, the other an iron cudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, Arya edged back from the cart and hurried off. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention, but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots. Arya had bee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  staying as far from the castle as she could get, yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king\'92s council. \
She had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been
\f3  slain
\f1  in turn by Lord Renly. Others insisted that Renly had killed the king i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  a drunken quarrel between brothers. Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief? One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that he\'92d died eating
\f3  a bo
\f1 ar, stuffing himself so full that he\'92d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had been the queen who poisoned him. No, he had died of a pox. No, he had choked on a fish bone. \
One thing all the sto
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ies agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide. They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king, a tanner\'92s boy told Arya. \
All she wanted was to go home, but leaving King\'92s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped. Talk of war was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on . . . well, her, for one. She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever she could find a place to lie down, and it hadn\'92t taken her long to learn that the district was well named. \
Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 even city gates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Those who w
\f3 ere allowe
\f1 d to leave left by the King\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Gate or
\f3  the Iron 
\f1 Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion- crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying dow
\f3 n from the 
\f1 roof of an inn by the King\'92s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open the
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 r saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot. \
Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous. She ha
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  no coin to pay a f
\f1 erryman or take passage on 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  ship. \
Her lord father had taught her never to steal, but it was growing harder to remember why. If she did not get out soon, she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks. She hadn\'92t gone hung
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 y much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword, but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick. A couple she\'92d eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom. \
In the Bottom there were pot-
\f3 sho
\f1 ps along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for 
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 ears, and you could trade half your bir
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  for a heel of yesterday\'92s bread and a \'93bowl o\'92 brown,\'94 and they\'92d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  up for you, so long as you plucked the feathers yourself. Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake, but the brown wasn\'92t so bad. It usually had barley in it, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, and sometimes even apple, with a film of grease swimming on top. Mostly she tried not to think about the meat. Once she had gotten a piece of fish. \
The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down her food, Arya could feel them watching. Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were thinking. With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn\'92t know what they were thinking, and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hat scared her even more. A couple times, 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her. \
The silver bracelet she\'92d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the cas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 le, along with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword . . . and Needle. She\'92d been lying on top of Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then Arya had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her hip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybod
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  could see it, to scare off robbers, b
\f3 ut th
\f1 ere were men in the pot-shops who wouldn\'92t have been scared off if she\'92d had a battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her tas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 e for pigeon and stale bread. Often as not
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares. \
Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits. In the city, the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs. The potshops \
would give you a fistful of coppers for a 
\f3 litt
\f1 er of pups, she\'92d heard, but she didn\'92t like 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o think about that. \
Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets. Arya scrambled through the crowds, trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the center of the street. Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them coming. If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn\'92t help but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met.
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 \
A whoopi
\f1 ng gang of small children went running pas
\f3 t, chasing a rolling hoop. Arya s
\f1 tared at them with resentment, remembering the times she\'92d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon. She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her \'93
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ittle sister\'94 and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. She\'92d seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn\'92t think hair got any more mussed than hers. \
She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something. The
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn\'92t answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack o
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding. \
A 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 ull wheeled overhead as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t it was well beyond the reach of her st
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ck. It made her think of the sea. Ma
\f3 ybe t
\f1 hat was the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 n trad
\f1 ing galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to vi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 it the riverfront. It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn\'92t checked that one today. \
The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish mark
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 t, but they never so much as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the king\'92s war g
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river. \
When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell\'92s colors brought tears
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to her eyes. Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her \
moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on the hull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braav
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 si, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve. \'93Please,\'94 she said, \'93what ship is this?\'94 \
\'93She\'92s the Wind Witch, out of Myr,\'94 the man said. \
\'93She\'92s still here,\'94 Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walk
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d away. Arya ran toward the pier. The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home . . . still waiting! She\'92d imagined it had sailed ages ago. \
Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 eyes her eyes, why did . . . \
Loo
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  with your eyes, she heard Syrio whisper. \
Arya looked. She knew all of her father\'92s men. The three in the grey cloaks were strangers. \'93You,\'94 the one walking rounds called out. \'93What do you want here, boy?\'94 The other two looked up from their dice. \
It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but she knew that if she did, they would be after her at once. She made herself walk closer. They were looking for a girl, but h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  thought she was a boy. She\'92d be a boy, then. \'93Want to buy a pigeon?\'94 She showed him the dead bird. \
\'93Get out of here,\'94 the guardsman said. \
Arya did as he told her. She did not have to pretend to be frightened. Beh
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nd her, the men went back to their dice. \
She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner\'92s sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses. Arya wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a whiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone. It must have slipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and she\'92d never noticed. For a moment she wanted to cry again. She\'92d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find anoth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r one that plump. \
Far across the city, bells began to ring. \
Arya glanced up, listening, wondering what the ringing meant this time. \'93What\'92s this now?\'94 a fat man called from the pot-shop.\
\'93The bells again, gods ha\'92mercy
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 wailed an old woman. \
A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window. \'93Is it the boy king that\'92s died now?\'94 she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \'93Ah, tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 \'92s a boy for you, they never last long.\'94 As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around he
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift. \
\'93Stupid slut,\'94 the fat man shout
\f3 ed up
\f1 . \'93The 
\f3 king\'92s 
\f1 not dead, that\'92s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring 
\f3 every bell in the cit
\f1 y.\'94 \
\'93Here, quit your biting, or I\'92ll ring your bells,\'94 the woman in the wi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 dow said to the man behind her, pushing him off with an elbow. \'93So who is it died, if not the king?\'94 \
\'93It\'92s a summoning,\'94 the fat man repeated. \
Two boys close to Arya\'92s age scampered past, splashing through a puddle. The old woman cursed 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h
\f3 em
\f1 , but they kept right on going. Other people were moving too, heading up the hill to see what the noise was about. Arya ran after the slower boy. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Where you going?\'94 she shouted when she was right behind him. \'93What\'92s happening?\'94 \
He glanced back without slowing. \'93The gold cloaks is carryin\'92 him to the sept.\'94 \'93Who?\'94 she yelled, running hard.\
\'93The Hand! They\'92ll be taking his head off, Buu says.\'94 \
A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street. The boy leapt over, but Arya never saw it. She tripped and fell, face first, scraping her knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle tangled between her legs. She sobbed as she struggled
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to her knees. The thumb of her left hand was covered with blood. When she sucked on it, she saw that half the thumbnail was gone, ripped off in her fall. Her hands throbbed, and her knee was all bloody too. \
\'93Make way!\'94 someone shouted from the cross street. \'93Make way for my lords of Redwyne!\'94 It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop. T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ey wore checked cloaks, blue- and-burgundy. Behind them, two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut \
mares alike as peas in a pod. Arya had se
\f3 en them in the bailey a hun
\f1 dred times; th
\f3 e Redwyne twins, Ser Horas an
\f1 d 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Hobber, homely youths with orange hair and square, freckled faces. Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and giggle whenever they caught sight of them. They did not look funny now. \
Everyone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about. The bells seemed louder now, clanging, calling. Arya joined the stream of people. Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 broken that it was all she could do not to cry. She bit her lip as she limped along, l
\f3 isten
\f1 ing to the excited voices around her. \
\'93\'97the King\'92s Hand, Lord Stark. They\'92re carrying him up to Baelor\'92s Sept.\'94 \
\'93I heard he was dead.\'94 \
\'93Soon enough, soon enough. Here, I got me a silver stag says they 
\f3 lop hi
\f1 s head off.\'94 \
\'93Past time, the traitor.\'94 The man spat. \
Arya struggled to find a voice. \'93He never\'97\'94 she started, but she was only a child and they talked right over her. \
\'93Fool! They ain\'92t neither going to lop him. Since w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en do they knick traitors 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n the steps of the Great Sept?\'94 \
\'93Well, they don\'92t mean to anoint him no knight. I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert. Slit his throat in the woods, and when they found him, he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace.\'94 \
\'93Ah, that\'92s not true, it was his own brother did him, that Renly, him with his gold antlers.\'94 \
\'93You shut your lying mouth, woman. You don\'92t know what you\'92re saying, his lordship\'92s a fine true man.\'94 \
By the time they reached the Street of the Sisters, they w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re packed in shoulder to shoulder. Arya let the human current carry her along, up to the top of Visenya\'92s Hill. The white marble plaza was a solid mass of people, all yammering excitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the Great Sept of Baelor. The bells were very loud here. \
Arya squirmed through the press, ducking between the legs 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f horses and clutching tight to her sword stick. From the middle of the crowd, all she could see were arms and legs \
and stomachs, and the seven slender towers of the sept looming overhe
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 d. She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where she might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at them and drove them off with a crack of his whip. \
Arya grew frantic. Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, she was shoved up against the sto
\f3 ne of a
\f1  plinth. She looked up at Baelor the Blessed, the septon king. Sliding her stick sword through her belt, Arya began to climb. Her broken thumbnail l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ft smears of blood on the painted marble, but she made it up, and wedged herself in between the king\'92s feet. \
That was when she saw her father. \
Lord Eddard stood on the High Septon\'92s pulpit outside the doors
\f3  of
\f1  the sept, supp
\f3 orted betwee
\f1 n two of the gold cloaks. He was dressed in a ri
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 h grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads, and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur, but he was thinner than Arya had ever seen him, his long face drawn with pain. He was not standing so much as being held up; the cast over his broken leg was grey and rotten. \
The High Septon himself stood behind 
\f3 him, a squa
\f1 t man, grey with age and pondero
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 sly fat, wearing long white robes and an
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows whenever he
\f3  mo
\f1 ved. \
Clustered around the doors of the sept, in f
\f3 ront o
\f1 f the raised marble pulpit, were a knot of knights and high lords. Joffrey was prominent among them, his raiment all crimson,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring l
\f3 io
\f1 ns, a gold crown on his head. His queen mothe
\f3 r s
\f1 too
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  beside him in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized the Hound, wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him. She saw Varys the eun
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for Mother. \

\f3 And 
\f1 there in th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ir midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists. Arya scowled, wondering what her sister wa
\f3 s doing here, why she looked 
\f1 so happy. \
A long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd, commanded by a stout man in elaborate ar
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 or, all black lacquer and gold filigree. His cloak had the metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold. \
When the bell
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settle
\f3 d a
\f1 cross the great plaza, and her
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 father \
lifted his head and began
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to speak, his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out. People behind her began to shout out, \'93What?\'94 and \'93Louder!\'94 The man in the black-a
\f3 nd-gol
\f1 d armor stepped up behind Father and prodded him sharply. You leave him alone
\f2\fs24 !
\f1 \cf3  Arya wan\cf2 te\cf3 d to shout, but sh\cf2 e \cf3 knew 
\f2 \cf2 n
\f1 \cf3 o one wou\cf2 ld\cf3  listen. She chewe\cf2 d \cf3 her l
\f2 \cf2 i
\f0\b\fs38 p. \

\f2\b0\fs24 H
\f1\fs28 er father raised his voice and began again. \'93I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King,\'94 he said more loudly, his voice carryi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g across the plaza, \'93and I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and men.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Arya whimpered. Below her, the crowd began to scream and shout. Taunts and 
\f3 obscen
\f1 ities filled the air. Sansa had hidden her fa
\f3 ce in he
\f1 r hands. \
Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. \'93I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert,\'94 he shouted. \'93I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was cold, I plotted to dep
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 se and murder his son and seize the throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Barathe
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\'94 \
A stone came sailing out of the crowd. Arya cried out as she saw her father hit. The gold cloaks kept him from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead. More stones followed. One struck the guard to Father\'92s left. Another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the black-and-gold armor. Two of the Kingsguard stepped in front of Joffrey and the q
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 een, protecting them with their shields. \
Her hand slid beneath her cloak and found Needle in its sheath. She tightened her fingers around the grip, squeezing as hard as she had ever squeezed anything. Please, gods, keep him safe, she prayed. Don\'92t let them hurt my father. \
The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. \'93As we sin, so do we suffer,\'94 he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than Father\'92s. \'93Th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and men, here in this holy place.\'94 Rainbows danced around his head as he 
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ifted his hands in entreaty. \'93The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor taught us that they are also merciful.
\f3  What
\f1  shall be done with this traitor, Your Grace?\'94 \
A thousand voices were screaming, but Arya never heard them. Prince Joffrey . . . no, King Joffrey . . . stepped out from behind the shields of his Kingsguard. \'93My mother 
\f3 bids
\f1  me let Lord Eddard take the b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ack, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.\'94 He looked straight at Sansa then, and smiled, and for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the crowd and said, \'93But they have
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your king, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser \
Ilyn, bring me his head!\'94 \
The crowd roared, and Arya felt the statue of Baelor rock as they surged against it. The High Septon clutched at the king\'92s cape, and Varys cam
\f3 e r
\f1 ushing over waving his arms, and even the queen was saying something to 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 im, but Joffrey shook his head. Lords and knights moved aside as he stepped through, tall and fleshless, a skeleton in iron mail, the King\'92s Justice. Dimly, as if from far off, Arya heard her sister scream. Sansa had fallen to her knees, sobbing 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ysterically. Ser Ilyn Payne climbed the steps of th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  pulpit. \
Arya wriggled between Baelor\'92s feet and threw herself into the crowd, drawing Needle. She landed on a man in a butcher\'92s apron, knocking him to the ground
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Immediately someone slammed into her back and she almost went down herself. Bodies closed in around her, stumbling and pus
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ing, trampling on the poor butcher. Arya slashed at them with Needle. \
High atop the pulpit, Ser Ilyn Payne gestured and the knight in black-and-gold gave a command. The gold cloaks flung Lord Eddard to the marble, with his head and chest out over the edge. \
\'93Here, you!\'94 an angry voice shouted at Arya, but she bowled past, s
\f3 hovi
\f1 ng people aside, squirming between them, slamming into anyone in her way. A hand fumbled at her leg and she hacked at it, kicked at shins. A woman stumbled and Arya ran up her b
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ck, cutting to both sides, but it was no good, no
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 good, there were too many people, no sooner did she make a hole than it closed again. Someone 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 uffeted her aside. She could still hear Sansa screaming. \
Ser Ilyn drew a two-ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ded greatsword from the scabbard on his back. As he lifted the blade above his head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor. Ice, she thought, he has Ice! Her tears streamed down her face, blinding her. \
And then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like a wolf trap, so hard that Needle went flying from her hand. Arya was wr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nched off her feet. She would have fallen if he hadn\'92t held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A face pressed close to hers, long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. \'93Don\'92t look!\'94 a thick voice snarled at her. \
\'93I . . . I . . . I . . . 
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  Arya sobbed. \
The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. \'93Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy.\'94 Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a . . . a noise . . . a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their brea
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h at once. The old man\'92s fingers dug into her arm, \
stiff as iron. \'93Look at me. Yes, that\'92s the way of it, at me.\'94 Sour wine perfumed his breath. \'93Remember, boy?\'94 \
It was the smell that did it. Arya saw the matted greasy hair, the patched, dusty black cloak that covered his twisted shoulders, the hard black eyes squinting at her. And she remembered the black brother who had come to visit her father. \
\'93Know me now, do you? There\'92s a bright boy.\'94 He spat. \'93They\'92re done here. You\'92ll be coming with me, and you\'92ll be keeping your mouth shut.\'94 When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. \'93Shu
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , I said.\'94 \
The plaza was beginning to empty. The press dissolved around t
\f3 hem as
\f1  people drifted back to their lives. But Arya\'92s life was gone. Numb, she trailed along beside . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . Yoren, yes, his name is Yoren. She did not recall him finding Needle, until he handed the sword back to her. \'93Hope you can use that, boy.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not\'97\'94 she started.\
He shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave it a twist, \
yanking her head back. \'93\'97not a smart boy, that what you mean to say?\'94 \
He had a knife in his other hand. \
As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kickin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 calp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears. \

BRAN \
The oldest were men grown, seventeen and eighteen years from the day of their naming. One was past twenty. Most were younger, sixteen or less. \
Bran watched them from the balcony of Maester Luwin\'92s turret, listening to them grunt and strain and curse as they swung their staves and wooden swords. The yard was alive to the clack of wood on wood, punctuated all too often by thwacks and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh. Ser Rodrik strode am
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng the boys, face reddening
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beneath his white whiskers, muttering at them one and all. Bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce. \'93No,\'94 he kept saying. \'93No. No. No.\'94 \
\'93They don\'92t fight very well,\'94 Bran said dubiously. He scratched Summer idly behind the ears as the direwolf tore at a haunch of meat. Bones crunched between his teeth.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93For a certainty,\'94 Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measurin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28  shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky. \'93Yet given time . . . Ser Rodrik has the truth of it, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father took the cream of his guard to King\'92s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely lads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their places.\'94 \
Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below. \'93If I still had my legs, I could beat them all.\'94 He remembered the last time he\'92d held a sword in his hand, when the king had come to Winterfell. It was only a wooden sword, yet he\'92d knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times. \'93Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe. If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs. We could be a knight together.\'94 \
\'93I think that . . . unlikely,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \'93Bran, when a man fights, his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one.\'94 \
Below in the yard, Ser Rodrik was yelling. \'93You fight like a goose. He pecks you and you peck him harder. Parry! Block the blow. Goose fighting will not suffice. If those were real swords, the first peck would take your arm off!\'94 One of the other boys laughed, and the old knight rounded on him. \'93You laugh. You. Now that is gall. You fight like a hedgehog . . . \'94 \
\'93There was a knight once who couldn\'92t see,\'94 Bran said stubbornly, as Ser Rodrik went on below. \'93Old Nan told me about him. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.\'94 \
\'93Symeon Star-Eyes,\'94 Luwin said as he marked numbers
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in a book. \'93When he lost his eyes, h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim. Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian the Fool. A fable from the Age of Heroes.\'94 The maester tsked. \'93You must put these dreams aside, they will only break your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 heart.\'94 \
The mention of dreams reminded him. \'93I dreamed abou
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  the crow again last night. The one with three eyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did. We w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt down to the crypts. Father was there, and we talked. He was sad.\'94 \
\'93And why was t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at?\'94 Luwin peered through his tube. \
\'93It was something to do about Jon, I thi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 k.\'94 The dream had been deeply disturbing, more so than any of the other crow dreams. \'93Hodor won\'92t go down into the crypts.\'94 \
The maester had only been half listening, Bran could tell. He lifted his eye from the tube, blinking. \'93Hodor won\'92t . . . \'94 \
\'93Go down into the crypts. When
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 I woke, I told him to take me down, to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 see if Father was truly there. At first he didn\'92t know what I was saying, but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there, only then he wouldn\'92t go down. He just stood on the top step and said \'91Hodor,\'92 like he was scared of the dark, but I had a torch. It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always doing.\'94 He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added, \'93I didn\'92t, thoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 .
\f3 \'94 \
\'93Go
\f1 od. Hodor is a ma
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , not a mule to be beaten.\'94 \
\'93In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can\'92t do that when I\'92m awake,\'94 Bran explained. \
\'93Why would you want to go down to the crypts?\'94 \'93I told you. To look for Father.\'94 \
The maester tugged at the chain around his neck, as he often did when he was uncomfortable. \'93Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his father\'92s father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the\
North . . . but that will not be for m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ny years, gods be good. Your father is a prisoner of the queen in King\'92s Landing. You will not find him in the crypts.\'94 \
\'93He was there last night. I talked to him.\'94\
\'93Stubborn boy,\'94 the maester sighed, setting his book aside. \'93Would you like to go see?\'94 \'93I can\'92t. Ho
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 or won\'92t go, and the steps are too narrow and twi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ty for Dancer.\'94\
\'93I believe I can solve that difficulty.\'94 \
In place of Hodor, the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wildling woman Osha was 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ummoned. She was tall and tough and uncomplaining, willing to go wherever she was commanded. \'93I lived my lif
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won\'92t fret me none, m\'92lords,\'94 she said. \
\'93Summer, come,\'94 Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms. The direwolf left his bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth. Maester Luwin went ahead with a torch. Bran di
\f3 d not
\f1  even mind\'97too
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 badly\'97that she carried him in her arms and not on h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha\'92s chain struck off, since she had served faithfully and well since she had been at W
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nterfell. She still wore the heavy iron shackles around her ankles\'97a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted\'97but they did not hinder her sure strides
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 down the steps. \
Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been before, for certain. When he was little, he used to play down here with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Robb and Jon and his sisters. \
He wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary. Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maest
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r\'92s to
\f3 rch. Even
\f1  Osha, hard as old iron, seemed uncomfortable. \'93Grim folk, by the look of them,\'94 she said as she eyed the l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ng row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93They were the Kings of Winter,\'94 Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place. \
Osha smiled. \'93Winter\'92s got no king. If you\'92d seen i
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , you\'92d know that, summer
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 boy.\'94 \
\'93They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,\'94 Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps. \'93Hard men for a hard time. Come.\'94 He strode briskly down the vault, past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures. A tongue of flame trailed back from the \
upraised torch as he went. \
The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him once that there were other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker whe
\f3 re the 
\f1 older kings were buried. It would not do to lose the light. Summer r
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 fused to move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her arms. \
\'93Do you recall your history, Bran?\'94 the maester said as they walked. \'93Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can.\'94 \
He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. \'93That one is Jon Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father\'92s father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter. Theon Stark\'92s the real t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 in one with the l
\f3 ong
\f1  hair and the skinny beard. They called him the \'91Hungry Wolf,\'92 because he was always at war. That\'92s a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy f
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ce, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the sea. His tomb is empty. He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again. His son was 
\f2\fs24 B
\f1\fs28 randon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his father\'92s ships in grief. There\'92s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts. And that\'92s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. He was the last King
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror. Oh, there, he\'92s Cregan Stark. He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he\'92d never faced a finer swordsman.\'94 They were almost at the end no
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 , and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. \'93And there\'92s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys. His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him. Not me, another Brandon, my father\'92s brother. They\'92re not supposed to have statues, that\'92s only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done.\'94 \
\'93The maid\'92s a fair one,\'94 Osha said. \
\'93Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her,\'94 Bran explained. \'93Robert fought a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 ut Lyanna died and he never got her back at all.\'94 \
\'93A sad tale,\'94 said Osha, \'93but those empty hol
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s are sadder.\'94 \
\'93Lord Eddard\'92s tomb, for when his time comes,\'94 Maester Luwin s
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 id. \'93Is this where you saw your father in your dream, Bran?\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 The memory made him shiver. He looked around the vault uneasily, the hairs on \
the back of his neck bristling. Had he heard a noise? Was there someone here? \
Maester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre, torch in hand. \'93As you see, he\'92s not here. Nor will he be, for many a year. Dreams are only dreams, child.\'94 He thrust 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is arm into the blackness inside the tomb, as into the mouth of some great beast. \'93Do you see? It\'92s quite empt\'97\'94 \
The darknes
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  sprang at him, snarling. \
Bran saw eyes like green fire, a flash of teeth, fur as black as the pit around them. 
\f2\fs24 M
\f1\fs28 aester Luwin yelled and threw up his hands. The torch went flying from his fin
\f3 gers
\f1 , caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark, and tumbled to the statue\'92s feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, they saw Luwin struggling with the direwol
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 , beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other. \
\'93Summer!\'94 Bran screamed. \
And Summer came, shooting from the dimness behind them, a leaping shadow. He slammed into Shaggydog and knocked him back, and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur, snapping and biting at each other, while Maester Luwin struggled to his knees, his arm torn and bloody. Osh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  propped Bran up against Lord Rickard\'92s stone wolf as she hurried to assist the maester. In the light of the guttering torch, shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought on the wall and roof. \
\'93Shaggy,\'94 a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little brother was standing in the mouth of Father\'92s tomb. With one final snap at Summer\'92s face, Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon\'92s side. \'93You let my father be,\'94 Rickon warned Luwin. \'93You let 
\f3 him be.\'94 
\f1 \
\'93Rickon,\'94 Bran said softly. \'93Father\'92s not here.\'94 \
\'93Yes he is. I saw him.\'94 Tears glistened on Rickon\'92s face. \'93I saw him last night.\'94 \
\'93In your drea
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  . . . ?\'94 \
Rickon nodded. \'93You leave him. You leave him be. He\'92s coming home now, like he promised. He\'92s coming home.\'94 \
Bran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before. Blood dripped down his arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath. \'93Osha, the torch,\'94 he said, biting through his pain, and she snatched it up before it went out. Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle\'92s likeness. \'93That . . . that beast,\'94 Luwin went \
on, \'93is supposed to be chained up in the kennels.\'94 \
Rickon patted Shaggydog\'92s muzzle, damp with blood. \'93I let him loose. He doesn\'92t like chains.\'94 He licked at his fingers. \
\'93Rickon,\'94 Bran said, \'93would you like to come with m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ?\'94 \'93No. I like it here.\'94\
\'93It\'92s dark here. And cold.\'94\
\'93I\'92m not afraid. I have to wait for Father.\'94 \
\'93You can wait with me,\'94 Bran said. \'93We\'92ll wait together, you and me and our wolves.\'94 Both of the direwolves were licking wounds now, and would bear close watching. \
\'93Bran,\'94 the maester said firmly, \'93I know you mean well, but Shaggydog is too wild to run loose. I\'92m th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  third man he\'92s savaged. Give him the freedom of the castle and it\'92s only a question of time before he kills someone. The truth is hard, but the wolf has to be chained, or . . . &rdquo He hesitated \
. . . or killed, Bran thought, but what he said was, \'93He was not made for chains. We will wait in your tower, all of us.\'94 \
\'93That is quite impossible,\'94 Maester Luwin said. \
Osha grinned. \'93The boy\'92s the lordling here, as I recall.\'94 She handed 
\f2\fs24 L
\f1\fs28 uwin back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again. \'93The maester\'92s tower it is.\'94 \
\'93Will you come, Rickon?\'94 \
His brother nodded. \'93If Shaggy comes too,\'94 he said, running after Osha and Bran, and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow, keeping a wary eye on th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  wolves. \
Maester Luwin\'92s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything. To
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 tering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture, the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the te
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 race door, star charts hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, and pots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters. Their st
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the \
maester\'92s wounds, under Luwin\'92s terse instruction. \'93This is folly,\'94 the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment. \'93I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream, yet when you stop to consider it, it\'92s only natural. You miss you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  lord father, and you know that he is a captive. Fear can fever a man\'92s mind and give him queer thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend\'97\'94 \
\'93I\'92m four now,\'94 Rickon said. He was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the First Keep. The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room, licking their wounds and gnawing on bones. \
\'93\'97too young, and\'97ooh, seven hells, that burns, no, don\'92t stop, more. Too young, as I say, but you, Bran, you\'92re old enough to know that dreams are only dreams.\'94 \
\'93Some are, some aren\'92t.\'94 Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash. Luwin gasped.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93The children of the f
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming.\'94 \
Tears were streaming down the maester\'92s face, yet he shook his head doggedly. \'93The chil
\f3 dren . . . 
\f1 live only in dreams. Now. Dead and gone. Enough, that\'92s enough. Now the bandages. Pads and then wrap, and make it tight, I\'92ll be bleeding.\'94 \
\'93Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like birds and swim like 
\f3 fish and
\f1  talk to the a
\f3 nimals,\'94 Bran s
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 id. \'93
\f1 She sa
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 s that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it.\'94 \
\'93And all this they did with magic,\'94 Maester Luwin said, distracted. \'93I wish they were here now. A spell would heal my arm
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 less painfully, and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite.\'94 He gave the big black wolf
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 an angry glance out of the corner of his eye. \'93Take a lesson, Bran. The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword. As t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e children did. Here, let me show you something.\'94 He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and returned with a green jar in his good hand. \'93Have a look at these,\'94 he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads. \
Bran picked one up. \'93It\'92s made of glass.\'94 Curious, Rickon drifted closer to peer over the table. \
\'93Dra
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 onglass,\'94 Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin, bandagings in hand. \
\'93Obsidian,\'94 Maester Luwin insisted, holding out
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his wounded arm. \'93Forged in the fires of the gods, far below the earth. The childre
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  of the forest hunted with that, thousands of years ago. The children worked no metal. In place of mail, they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark, so they seemed to melt into the wood. In place of swords, they carried blades of obsidian.\'94 \
\'93And still do.\'94 Osha pl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1 \cf3 ced soft \cf2 pa\cf3 ds over the bites \cf2 on\cf3  the 
\f2 \cf2 m
\f1 \cf3 aester\'92s \cf2 fo\cf3 rearm and bound th\cf2 em\cf3  tigh
\f2 \cf2 t
\f0\b\fs38  with 
\f2\b0\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ong strips of linen. \
Bran held the arrowhead up close. The black glass was slick and sh
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ny. He thought it beautiful. \'93Can I keep one?\'94 \
\'93As you wish,\'94 the maester said.\
\'93I want one too,\'94 Rickon said. \'93I want four. I\'92m four.\'94\
Luwin made him count them out. \'93Careful, they\'92re still sharp. Don\'92t cut yourself.\'94 \'93Tell me about the children,\'94 Bran said. It was important.\
\'93What do you wish to know?\'94\
\'93Everything.\'94 \
Maester Luwin tugged at his chai
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  collar where it chafed against his neck. \'93They were people of the Dawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,\'94 he said. \'93In those days, there were no castles or holdfasts, no cities, not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne. There were no men at all. Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms. \
\'93They were a people dark and beautif
\f3 ul, sma
\f1 ll of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were quick and gra
\f3 ceful. 
\f1 Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names ar
\f3 e secre
\f1 t. Their wise men were called greenseers,
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 and carved strange fac
\f1 es in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods. How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know. \
\'93But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken. They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men wer
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  by the faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms, they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-struck, the children went to war. The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, but it was too late to close the door. The wars went on until the earth \
ran red with blood of men and children both, but more children than me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 , for men were bigger and stronger, and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally the wise of both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small i
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 land in the great lake called Gods Eye. \
\'93There they forged the Pact. The First Men were given the coastlands, the high plains and bright meadows, the mountains and bogs, but the deep woods were to remain forever the children\'92s, and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm. So the gods might bear witness to the signing, every tree on the island was given a face, and afterward, the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the Is
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e of Faces. \
\'93The Pact began four thousand years of friend
\f3 ship
\f1  between men and children. In time, the First M
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n even put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.\'94 \
Bran\'92s fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead. \'93But the children of the forest are all gone now, you said.\'94 \
\'93Here, they are,\'94 said Osha, as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth. \'93North of the Wall, things are different. That\'92s where
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the children went, and the giants, and the other old races.\'94 \
Maester Luwin sighed. \'93Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains. The Starks have treated you more gently than you deserve. It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys\'92 heads with folly.\'94 \
\'93Tell me where they went,\'94 Bran 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid. \'93I want to know.\'94 \'93Me too,\'94 Rickon echoed. \
\'93Oh, very well,\'94 Luwin muttered. \'93So long as the kingdo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 s of the First Men held sway, the Pact endured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet finally there came 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  time, many centuries later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea. \
\'93The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests. The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the end the six southr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n kingdoms all fell before them. Only here, where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck, \
did the rule of the First Men endure. The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered 
\f3 the c
\f1 hildren where they found them, and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods. So the children f
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ed north\'97
\f3 \'94 \

\f1 Summer began to howl. \
Maester Luwin broke off, startled. When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and adde
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  his voic
\f3 e to 
\f1 his brother\'92s, dread clutched at Bran\'92s heart. \'93It\'92s comin
\f3 g,\'94 
\f1 he 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 hispered, with the certainty of despair. He had known it since last night, he realized, since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell. He had known it, but he had not be
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ieved. He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right. The crow, he thought, the three-eyed \
crow . . . \
The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Summer padded across the tower floor to Shaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother\'92s neck. From the window came a flutter of wings. \
A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress. \
Rickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd clattered on the floor. Bran pulled him close and hugged him. \
Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers. He rose, slow as a sleepwalker, and moved to the window. When he whistled, the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm. There was dried blood on its wings. \'93A hawk,\'94 Luwin murmured, \'93perhaps an owl. Poor thing, a wonder
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 it got through.\'94 He took the letter from its leg. \
Bran foun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper. \'93What is it?\'94 he said, holding his brother all the harder. \
\'93You know 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 h
\f3 at it is, 
\f1 boy,\'94 Osha said, not unkindly. She put her hand on his head. \
Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool r
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 be and tears in his bright grey eyes. \'93My lords,\'94 he said to the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken, \'93we . . . we shall need to find 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  stonecarver who knew his likeness well . . . \'94 \

SANSA \
In the tower room at the heart of Maegor\'92s Holdfast, Sansa gave herself to the d
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 rkness. \
She drew the curtains around her bed, slept, woke weeping, and slept again. When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief. Servants came and w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt, bringing meals, but the sight of food was more than she could bear. The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took them 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 way again. \
Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on his back, saw the moment . . . the moment when . . . she had wanted to look away, she had wanted to, her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees, yet somehow she could not turn her head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and her prince had smiled at her, he\'92d smiled and she\'92d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  said those words, and her father\'92s legs . . . that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they\'92d jerked when Ser Ilyn . . . when the sword . . . \
Perhaps I will die too, she told herself, and the thought did not seem so terrible to her. If she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief. Her body would lie on the stones below, broken and innocent, shaming all those who had betrayed her. Sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the shutters . . . but then her courage left her, and she ran back to her bed, sobbing. \
The serving girls tried to ta
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 k to her when they brought her meals, but she never an
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 wered them. Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles, to\
ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, made her undress, and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ouched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and to
\f3 ld her
\f1  to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then and went back to sleep. \
She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen, trembli
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 g, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn \
Payne, she knew, coming
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 for her with Ice in his hand, coming to take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent with his d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ad eyes and his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to cover herself with her hands, as her door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through . . . \
She woke murmuring, \'93Please, please, I\'92ll be good, I\'92ll be good, please don\'92t,\'94 but there was no one to hear. \
When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains drawn, and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of the door. Then her bed hangings
\f3  were
\f1  yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her. \
\'93You will attend me in court this afternoon,\'94 Joffrey said. \'93See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed.\'94 Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and gre
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n mantle, his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks. \
Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. \'93No,\'94 she whimpered, \'93please . . . leave me be.\'94 \
\'93If you won\'92t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you,\'94 Joffrey said. \'93I beg of you, my prince . . . \'94\
\'93I\'92m king now. Dog, get her out of bed.\'94 \
Sandor Clegane scoop
\f3 ed her up around th
\f1 e waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. \'93Do as you
\f3 \'92re bid, child,\'94 Clegane 
\f1 said. \'93Dress.\'94 He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently. \
Sansa backed away from them. \'93I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote wh
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t she told me. You promised you\'92d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I won\'92t do any treason, I\'92ll be good, I swear it, I don\'92t have traitor\'92s blood, I don\'92t. I only want to go home.\'94 Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head. \'93As it please you,\'94 she finished weakly. \
\'93It does not please me,\'94 Joffrey said. \'93Mother says I\'92m still to marry you, so you\'92ll stay here, and you\'92ll obey.\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t want to marry you,\'94 Sansa wailed. \'93You chopped off my father\'92s head!\'94 \
\'93He was a traitor. I never promised to spare him, only that I\'92d be merciful, and I was. If he hadn\'92t been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death.\'94 \
San
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 a stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed his face. She wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and his eyes were vain and cruel. \'93I hate you,\'94 she whispered. \
King Joffrey\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 face hardened. \'93My mother tells me that it isn\'92t fitting that a king should strike his wife. Ser Meryn.\'94 \
The knight was on her before she could think, yanking back her h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd as she tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa did not remember failing, yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes. Her head was ringing. Ser Meryn Trant stood over her, with b
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ood on the knuckles of his white silk 
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 l
\f3 ove. \
\'93Wi
\f1 ll you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?\'94 \
Sansa\'92s ear felt numb.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and red. \'93I . . . as . . . as you command, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 Joffrey corrected her. \'93I shall look for yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  in court.\'94 He turned and left. Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to \
yank her roughly to her feet. \'93Save yourself some pain, g
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 rl, and give him what he wants.\'94 \'93What 
\f3 . . . what does he want? Please, tell me.\'94 \
\'93He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be hi
\f1 s lady love,\'94 the Hound rasped. \'93He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he septa taught you. He wants you to love him . . . and fear him.\'94 \
After he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber. \'93I will need hot water for my bath, ple
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 se,\'94 she \
told them, \'93and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise.\'94 The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but she
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 knew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful. \
The hot water made her think of Winterfell, and she took strength fro
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  that. She had not washed since the day her father died, and she was startled at how f
\f3 il
\f1 thy the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood off her face, scrubbed the dirt from h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r back, washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except 
\f3 to gi
\f1 ve 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hem commands; they were Lannister servants, not her own, and she did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney. Sh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  recalled how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the feast. Perhaps it would
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 make him remember as well, and treat her more gently. \
She drank a glass of butterm
\f3 ilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited, to settle h
\f1 er
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 stomach. It was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had donned his white armor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 emoved from his helm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey. \'93My lady,\'94 he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past. \'93His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room.\'94 \
\'93Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?\'94 \
\'93Are you refusing to come, my lady?\'94 The look he gave her was without expression. He did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her. \
He did not hate
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her. He felt nothing for her at all. She was only a . . . a thing to him. \'93No,\'94 she said, rising. She wanted to rage, to hurt him as he\'92d hurt her, to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again . . . but s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e remembered what the Hound had told her, so all she said was, \'93I shall do whatever His G
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ace commands.\'94 \
\'93As I do,\'94 he replied.\
\'93Yes . . . but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn.\'94 \
Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew. Other men might have cursed her, warned her to keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness. Ser Meryn Trant did none of these. Ser Meryn Trant simply did not care. \
The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey
\f3  sat on his Iron Throne and disp
\f1 ensed what it please
\f3 d him to call justice. Nine c
\f1 as
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him. \
A thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, righ
\f3 t th
\f1 ere in court. Two knights came t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that they should duel for it on the mo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 row. \'93To the death,\'94 he add
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d. A woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, she said, and she wanted to see him decently buried. \'93If you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor too,\'94 Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons. \
Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ug
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 y face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that s
\f3 ome
\f1  hero would throw him down and cut off h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 s head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. \'93Life is not a song, sweetling,\'94 he\'92d told her. \'93You may lea
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 n that one day to your sorrow.\'94 In life, 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound\'92s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. \'93Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.\'94 \
The last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song tha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  ridiculed the late King Robert. Joff commande
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court. The singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again, but the king insisted. It was sort of a funny song, all about Robert fighting with a pig. The pig was the boar who\'92d killed him, Sansa knew, but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey announced that he\'92d decided to be merciful. 
\f2\fs24 T
\f1\fs28 he singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue. He would have a day to make his choice. J
\f3 anos 
\f1 Slynt n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 dded. \
That was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her ordeal was not yet done. W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 en the herald\'92s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined her critically, top to b
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ttom. \'93You look much better than you did.\'94 \
\'93Thank you, Your Grace,\'94 Sansa said. Hollow words, but they 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ade him nod and smile. \'93Walk with me,\'94 Joffrey commanded, offering her his arm. She had
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 no choice but to take \
it. The touch of his hand would have thrilled her once; now it made her 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 lesh crawl. \'93My name day will be here soon,\'94 Joffrey said as they slipped out the rear of the throne room. \'93There will be a great feast, and gifts. What are you going to give me?\'94 \
\'93I . . . I had not thought, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Your Grace,\'94 he said
\f3  shar
\f1 ply. \'93You truly are a stupid girl, aren\'92t you? My mother says so.\'94 \
\'93She does
\f3 ?\'94 After all that had happ
\f1 ened, his words should have lost their power to hurt her, yet somehow they had n
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 t. The queen had always been so kind to her. \

\f3 \'93Oh, yes
\f1 . She worries about our children, whether they\'92ll be stupid like you, but I told her not to trouble herself.\'94 The k
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng gestured, and Ser Meryn opened a door for them. \
\'93Thank you, Your Grace,\'94 she murmured. The Hound was right, she thought, I am only a little
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 bird, rep\cf2 ea\cf3 ting the words the\cf2 y \cf3 taugh
\f2 \cf2 t
\f1 \cf3  me. The \cf2 su\cf3 n had fallen below\cf2  t\cf3 he we
\f2 \cf2 s
\f0\b\fs38 tern wall
\f2\b0\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and the stones of the Red Keep gl
\f3 owed dark as blood. \
\'93I\'92ll get you with c
\f1 hi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 d as soon as you\'92re able,\'94 Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard. \'93If the first one is stupid, I\'92ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife. When do you think you\'92ll be able to have children?\'94 \
Sansa could not look at him, he shamed her so. \'93Septa Mordane says most . . . 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 o
\f3 st highborn girls have their flowering at 
\f1 tw
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 lve or thirteen.\'94 \
Joffrey nodded. \'93This way.\'94 He led her into the gatehouse, to the base of the steps that led up to the battlements. \
Sansa jerked back away from him, trembling. Suddenly she knew where they were going. \'93No,\'94 she said, her voice a frightened gasp. \'93Please, no, don\'92t make me, I beg you . . . \'94 \
Joffrey pressed his lips together. \'93I want to show you what happens to traitors.\'94 Sansa shook her head wildly. \'93I won\'92t. I won\'92t.\'94 \
\'93I can have Ser Meryn drag you up,\'94 he said. \'93You won\'92t like th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t. You h
\f3 ad better do what I say.\'94 Joffrey reac
\f1 he
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  for her, and Sansa cringed away from him, backing into the Hound. \
\'93Do it, girl,\'94 Sandor Clegane told her, pushing her back toward the king. His mouth \
twitched on the burned side of his face and Sansa could almost hear the rest of it. He\'92ll have you up there no matter what, so give him what he wants. \
She forced herself to take King Joffrey\'92s hand. The climb was something out of a nightmare; every step was a struggle
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  as if s
\f3 he were pulling her feet out of ankle-
\f1 de
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 p mud, and there were more steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts. \
From the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below them. Sansa could see 
\f3 the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\'92s 
\f1 hill, where her father had died. At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit. To the west, the swollen red sun was half-h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 dden beh
\f3 ind the Gate of the Gods. The 
\f1 salt sea
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was at her back, and to the south was the fish market and the docks and the swirling torrent of the Blackwater Rush. And to the north . . . \
She turned that way, and saw only the city, streets and alleys and hills and bot
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 oms and 
\f3 more streets and more alleys a
\f1 nd the s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 one of distant walls. Yet she knew that beyond them was open country, farms and fields and forests, and beyond that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell. \
\'93What are you looking at?\'94 Joffrey said. \'93This is what I wanted you to see, right here.\'94 \
A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa\'92s chin, with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers. The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city. 
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 ansa had
\f3  noted them the moment s
\f1 he\'92d ste
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier. He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can\'92t make me see them. \
\'93This one is your father,\'94 he said. \'93This one here. Dog, turn it around so she can see him.\'94 \
Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair an
\f3 d turne
\f1 d it. The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer. Sansa looked at it calmly, not seeing it at all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look real. \'93How long do I have to look?\'94 \
Joffrey seemed
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 disappoi
\f3 nted. \'93Do you wa
\f1 nt to se
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  the rest?\'94 There was a long row of them. \
\'93If it please Your Grace.\'94 \
Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes. \'93I\'92m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly,\'94 he explained. The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father. Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable. The king pointed to one and said, \'93That\'92s your septa there,\'94 but Sansa could not
\f3  even
\f1  have told that it was a wo
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 an. The 
\f3 jaw had rot
\f1 ted off 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er face, and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek. \
Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although she supposed she had known all along. \'93Why did you kill her?\'94 she asked. \'93She was godsworn . . . \'94 \
\'93She was a traitor.\'94 Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was upsetting him. \'93You haven\'92t said what you mean to give me for my name day. Maybe I should give you so
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 ething instead, would you like that?\'94 \
\'93If it please you, my lor
\f3 d,\'94 Sans
\f1 a said. \
When he smiled, she knew he was mock
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng her. \'93Your brother is a traitor too, you know.\'94 He turned Septa Mordane\'92s head back around. \'93I remember your brother from Winterfell. My dog called him the lor
\f3 d of t
\f1 he wooden sword
\f3 . Didn\'92t you, dog?\'94 \
\'93Di
\f1 d I?\'94 the Hound replied. \'93I don\'92t recall.\'94 \
Joffrey gave a petulant shrug. \'93Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime. My mother says it was treachery and deceit. She wept when she heard. Women are all weak, even her, though she pretends she isn\'92t. She says we need to stay in King\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  Landi
\f3 ng in ca
\f1 se my other uncles attack, but I don\'92t care. After my name day feast, I\'92m going to raise a host and kill your brother myself. That\'92s what I\'92ll give you, Lady Sansa. Your brother\'92s head.\'94 \
A kind of madness took over her then, and she heard herself say, \'93Maybe my brother will give me your head.\'94 \
Joffrey scowled. \'93You must never mock me like 
\f3 that. A tr
\f1 ue wif
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  does not mock her lord. Ser Meryn, teach her.\'94 \
This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her. He hit her twice, left to right, and harder, right to left. Her lip split and blood ran down her chin, to mingle with the salt of her tears. \
\'93You shouldn\'92t be crying all the time,\'94 Joffrey told her. \'93You\'92re more pretty when you 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 mile and laugh.\'94 \
Sansa made herself smil
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 , afraid that he would have Ser Mer
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 n hit her again if she did \
not, but it was no good, the king still shook his head. \'93W
\f3 ipe off 
\f1 the blood, you\'92re all messy.\'94 \
The outer parapet came up t
\f3 o her
\f1  chin, but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing, nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below. All it would take was a shove, she told herself. He was standing right there, right there, smirking at her with those fat wormlips. You could do it, she told herself. You could.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Do it right now. It wouldn\'92t even matter if she went over with him. It wouldn\'92t matter at all. \
\'93Here, girl.\'94 Sandor Clegane knelt before her, between her and Joffrey. With a delicacy surprising in such a big man, he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken li
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 . \
The moment was gone. Sansa lowered her eyes. \'93Thank you,\'94 she said when he was done. She was a good girl, and always remembered her courtesies. \

DAENERYS \
Wings shadowed her fever dreams.\
\'93You don\'92t want to wake the dragon, do you?\'94 \
She was
\f3  wal
\f1 king down a long hall beneath high stone arches. She could not look behind her, must not look behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone. \
\'93You don\'92t want to wake the dragon, do you?\'94 \
She saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind stirred the grasses, and they rippled like wate
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 . Drogo hel
\f3 d her 
\f1 in strong arms, and his hand 
\f3 stroked 
\f1 her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 m, stars in a daylight sky.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'93Home,\'94 she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame. \
\'93 . . . don\'92t want to wake the dragon, do you?\'94 \
Ser Jorah\'92s face was drawn and sorrowful. \'93Rhaegar was the last dragon,\'94 he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing braz
\f3 ier where
\f1  stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. \'93The last dragon,\'94 he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. She felt the dark behind her, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d the red door seemed farther away than ever. \
\'93 . . . don\'92t want to wake the dragon, do you?\'94 \
Viserys stood before her, screaming. \'93The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\'94 The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \'93I am the dragon and I will be cr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wned!\'94 he shr
\f3 ieked, a
\f1 nd 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 is fingers snapped like snakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks. \
\'93 . . . don\'92t want to wake the dragon . . . \'94 \
The red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  If i
\f3 t cau
\f1 ght her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She began to run. \
\'93 . . . don\'92t want to wake the dragon . . . \'94 \

\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 he could feel the heat inside her
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  a terrible burning in her womb. Her son was tall and proud, with Drogo\'92s copper skin and her o
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers, but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out. She saw his heart burning through his chest, and in an instant he was gone,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for h
\f3 er child
\f1 , the promise of a sweet mouth on her b
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 east, but her tears turne
\f3 d to steam as 
\f1 they touched her skin. \
\'93 . . . want to wake the dragon . . . \'94 \
Ghosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their ha
\f3 nds wer
\f1 e swords of pale fire. They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade. \'93Faste
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ,\'94 they cried, \'93faster, faster.\'94 She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever they touched. \'93Faster!\'94 the ghosts cried as one, and 
\f3 she screamed and threw herself forward.
\f1  A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blo
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 d and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. \
\'93 . . . wake the dragon . . . \'94 \
The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in t
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she c
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 uld see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her war
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 , there. She threw open the door. \
\'93 . . . the dragon . . . \'94 \
And saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a s
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 allion as black as his armor. Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm. \'93The last dragon,\'94 Ser Jorah\'92s voice whispered faintly. \'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e last, the last.\'94 Dany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own. \
After that, for a long time, th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 re was only the pain, the fire within her, and the whisperings of stars. \
She woke to the taste of ashes.\

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 No,\'94 she moaned, \'93no, please.\'94\
\'93Khaleesi?\'94 Jhiqui hovered over her, a frightened doe. \
The tent was drenched in shadow,
\f3  still
\f1  and close. Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier, and Dany followed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above. Flying, she thought. I had wings, I was flying. But it was only a dream. \'93Help me,\'94 she whispered, struggling to rise. \'93Bring me . . . \'94 Her voice was raw as a wound, and she could not think what she wanted. Why did she hurt s
\f2\fs24 o
\f3\fs28  much? I
\f1 t was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps. \'93I want . . . \'94 \
\'93Yes, Khaleesi.\'94 Quick as that Jhiqui was gone, bolting from the tent, shouting. Dany needed . . . something . . . someone . . . what? It was imp
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rtant, she knew. It was the only thing in the world that mattered. She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her, fighting the blanket 
\f3 tangled 
\f1 abo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t her legs. It was so hard to move. The world swam dizzily. I have to . . . \
They fou
\f3 nd he
\f1 r on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks, while she struggled feebly aga
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 nst him. Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur. \'93I must,\'94 she tried to tell them, \'93I have to . . . \'94 \
\'93 . . . sleep, Princess,\'94 Ser Jorah said. \
\'93No,\'94 Dany said. \'93Please. Please.\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 He covered her with silk, though she was burning. \'93Sleep and grow strong again, Khaleesi. Come back to us.\'94 And then Mirri Maz Duur was there, the maegi, ti
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 ping a cup against her lips. She tasted sour milk, and something else, something th
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ck and bitter. War
\f3 m liquid ran down her ch
\f1 in. Somehow she swallowed. The tent grew dimmer, and sleep took her again. This time she did not dream. She floated, serene and at peace, on a black sea that knew no shore. \
After a time\'97a night, a day, a ye
\f3 ar, s
\f1 he could not say\'97she woke again. The tent was dark, its silken walls flapping like wings when 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he wind gusted ou
\f3 tside. T
\f1 his time Dany did not attempt to rise. \'93Irri,\'94 she called, \'93Jhiqui. Doreah.\'94 They were there at once. \'93My \
throat is dry,\'94 she said, \'93so
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dry,\'94 and they brought her water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank it eagerly, and sent Jhiqui fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  more. Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow. \'93I have been sick,\'94 Dany said. The Dothraki girl nodded. \'93How long?\'94 The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, it frightened her. \'93Long,\'94 she whispered. When Jhiqui returned with more water, Mirri Maz Duur came with her, eyes heavy from sleep. \'93Drink,\'94 she said, lifting Dany\'92s head to the cup once more, but this time it was only wine. Sweet, sweet wine. Dany drank, and lay back, listening to the soft sound of her own breathing. She could feel the heaviness in her limbs, as sleep crept in to fill her up once more. \'93Bring me . . . \'94 she murmured, her voice slurred and drowsy. \'93Bring . . . I want to hold . . . \'94 \
\'93Yes?\'94 the maegi asked. \'93What is it you wish, Khaleesi?\'94\
\'93Bring me . . . egg . . . dragon\'92s egg . . . please . . . \'94 Her lashes turned to lead, and she was \
too we
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ry to hol
\f3 d them up
\f1 . \
When she woke the t
\f3 hird 
\f1 time, a shaft of golde
\f3 n su
\f1 nlight was pour
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ng through the smoke hole of the tent, and her arms were wrapped around a dragon\'92s egg. It was the pale one, its scales the color of butter cream, veined with whorls of gold and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of it. Beneath her bedsilks, a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin. Dragon
\f3 dew, she t
\f1 hought. Her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the stone she felt something twist and stretch in 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 esponse. It did not frighten he
\f3 r. All h
\f1 er fear was gone, burned away. \
Dany touched her brow. Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the touch, her fever gone. She mad
\f3 e he
\f1 rself sit. There was a moment of dizzin
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ss, and the deep ache between her thighs. Yet she felt strong. Her maids came running at the sound of 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er voice. \'93Water,\'94 she told them, \'93a flagon of water, cold as you can find it. And fruit, I think. Dates.\'94 \
\'93As you
\f3  say
\f1 , Khaleesi.\'94 \
\'93I want Ser Jorah,\'94 she said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ers. \'93And a warm b
\f3 ath, and
\f1  Mirri Maz Duu

\f1\fs28  herself to say, watching their faces with dread. \'93Is he&mdash?\'94 \
\'93The khal lives,\'94 Irri answered quietly . . . yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words, and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water. \
She turned to Doreah. \'93Tell
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 me.\'94 \
\'93I . . . I shall bring Ser Jorah,\'94 t
\f3 he Lysen
\f1 e girl said, bowing her head and fleeing the tent. \
Jhiqui wou
\f3 ld ha
\f1 ve run as well, but Dany caught her by the wris
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  and held her captive. \'93What is it? I must know. Drogo . . . and my child.\'94 Why had she not remembered the child until now? \'93My son . . . Rhaego . . . where is he? I want him.\'94 \
Her handmaid lowered her eyes. \'93The boy . . . he did not live, Khaleesi.\'94 Her voice was a frig
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 tened whisper. \
Dany released her wrist. My son is dead, s
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e thought as Jhiqui left the tent. She had known somehow. She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui\'92s tears. No, she had known before she woke. Her dream came back to her, sudden and vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid, bursting into flame. \
She should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ept in her dream, and the tears had turned to steam on h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of me, she told herself. She felt sad, and yet . . . she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as if he had never been. \
Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other dragon\'92
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with, wh
\f3 ich w
\f1 as 
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 assing strange. \'93Ser Jorah, come here,\'94 she said. She took his hand and pl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 ced it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls. \'93What do you feel?\'94 \
\'93Shell, hard as rock.\'94 The knight was wary. \'93Scales.\'94 \'93Heat?\'94 \
\'93No. Cold stone.\'94
\f3  He to
\f1 ok his hand away. \'93Princess, are you well? Should you be up, weak as you are?\'94 \
\'93Weak? I am strong, Jorah.\'94 To please him, she reclined on a pil
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  of cushions. \'93Tell me how my child died.\'94 \
\'93He never lived, my princess.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 The women say . . . \'94 He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him, and the way he limped when he moved. \
\'93Tell me. Tell me what the women say.\'94\
He turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. \'93They say the child was . . . \'94 \
She waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He
\f3  looke
\f1 d half a corpse himself. \
\'93Monstrous,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous. \'93Twisted. I dr
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 w him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  a bat. When I touched him, the flesh slough
\f3 ed off the bone, and ins
\f1 ide he was full of graveworms and the stink of corrup
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ion. He had been dead for years.\'94 \
Darkness, Dany thought. The 
\f3 terrible 
\f1 darkness sweeping up behind to devour
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 her. If she looked back she was lost. \'93My son was alive
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 a
\f3 nd str
\f1 ong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,\'94 she said. \'93I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.\'94 \
\'93That may be as it may be,\'94 answered Mirri Maz Duur, \'93yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said. Death was in that tent, Khaleesi.\'94 \
\'93Only shadows,\'94 Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice. \'93I saw, maegi. I saw you, alone, dancing with the shadows. \'93 \
\'93The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,\'94 Mirri said. \'93Long and dark, and in the end no light can hold them back.\'94 \
Ser Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 He had done w
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at he did for love and loyalty, yet he had car
\f3 ried 
\f1 her into a place no living man should go and fed her bab
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  to the darkness. He knew it too; t
\f3 he gr
\f1 ey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. \'93The shadows have touched you too
\f3 , Ser 
\f1 Jorah,\'94 she told him. The knight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. \'93You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant the horse.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Mirri Maz Duur said. \'93T
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at was a lie you told yourself. You knew the price.\'94 \
Had she? Had she? If I look back I am lost. \'93The price was paid,\'94 Dany said. \'93The horse, my child, Quaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo. The price was paid and paid and paid.\'94 She rose from her cushions. \'93Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me, godswife, maegi, bloodmage, whatever you are. Show me Kha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  Drogo. Show me what I bought with my son\'92s life.\'94 \
\'93As you command, Khaleesi,\'94 the old woman said. \'93Come, I will take you to him.\'94 Dany was weaker than she knew. Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her \
stand. \'93Time enough for this later, my princess,\'94 he said quietly. \'93I would see him now, Ser Jorah.\'94 \
After the dimness of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 tent, the world outside was blinding bright. The sun burned like molten gold, and the land was seared and empty. Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support her. Aggo and Rakharo stood behind. The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see
\f3  more,
\f1  until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes. She saw the ashes of a fire, a few score horses milling listlessly and searching 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or a bite of grass, a scattering of tents and bedrolls. A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her, and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work, and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies. A count might show a hundred people, no more. Where the other forty thousand had made their camp, only the wind and dust lived
\f3  now. \
\'93
\f1 Drogo\'92s khalasar is gone,\'94 she said.\
\'93A khal who cannot ride is no khal,\'94 said Jhogo. \
\'93The Dothraki follow only the strong,\'94 Ser Jorah said. \'93I am sorry, my princess
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  There was no way to hold them. Ko Pono left first, naming himself Khal Pono, and many followed him. Jhaqo was not long to do the same. The rest slipped away night by night, in large bands and small. There are a dozen new khalasars on the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogo\'92s.\'94 \
\'93The old remain,\'94 said Aggo. \'93The frightened, the weak, and the sick. And we who s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ore. We remain.\'94 \
\'93They took Khal Drogo\'92s herds, Khaleesi,\'94 Rakharo said. \'93We were too few to stop them. It is the right of the strong to take from the weak. They took many slaves as well, the khal\'92s and yours, yet they left some few.\'94 \
\'93Eroeh?\'94 asked Dany, remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the Lamb Men. \
\'93
\f2\fs24 M
\f3\fs28 ago s
\f1 eized her, who is Khal
\f3  Jhaqo\'92s bloodrid
\f1 er
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 now,\'94 said Jhogo. \'93He mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal, and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders. They were six. When they were done with
\f3  her, they cut her throa
\f1 t.\'94 \
\'93It was her fate, Khaleesi,\'94 said Aggo.\
If I look back I am lost. \'93It
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was a cruel fate,\'94 Dany said, \'93yet not so cruel as Mago\'92s will \
be. I promise you 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1 \cf3 hat, by t\cf2 he\cf3  old gods and the \cf2 ne\cf3 w, by
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 the lamb \cf2 go\cf3 d and the horse go\cf2 d \cf3 and e
\f2 \cf2 v
\f0\b\fs38 ery god
\f2\b0\fs24  
\f1\fs28 that lives. I swear it by the Mother of M
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 untains and the Womb of the World. Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.\'94 \
The Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances
\f2\fs24 .
\f3\fs28  \'93Kh
\f1 aleesi, \'93 the handmaid Irri explained, as if to a child, \'93Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at his back.\'94 \
She lifted her head. \'93And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\'92s daughter, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\'94 \
He was lying on the bare red earth, staring up at the sun. \
A dozen bloodflies had settled on his body, though he did not seem to feel them
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Dany brushed them away and knelt beside him. His eyes were wide open but did not see, and she knew at once that he was blind. When she whispered his name, he did not seem to h
\f3 ear. 
\f1 The wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be, the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous. \
\'93Why is he out here alone, in the sun?\'94 she asked them. \
\'93He seems to like the warmth, Princess,\'94 Ser Jorah said. \'93His eyes follow the sun, though he does not see it. He can walk after a fashion. He will go where you lead him, but no farther. He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips.\'94 \
Dany 
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 issed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow, and stood to face Mirri Maz Duur. \'93Your spells are costly, maegi.\'94 \
\'93He lives,\'94 said Mirri Maz Duur. \'93You asked for life. You paid for life.\'94 \
\'93This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was. His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between his legs. His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy. H
\f3 is li
\f1 fe was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him.\'94 \
Mirri Maz Duur made no reply.\
\'93When will he be as he was?\'94 Dany demanded. \
\'93When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\'94 said Mirri Maz Duur. \'93When the se
\f2\fs24 a
\f3\fs28 s go dry and mountains blow in the w
\f1 ind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.\'94 \
Dany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others. \'93Leave us. I would speak with this maegi alone.\'94 Mormont and the Dothraki withdrew. \'93You knew,\'94 Dany said when they were go
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 e. She ached, inside and out, but her fury gave her strength. \'93You knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.\'94 \
\'93It was wrong of them to burn my temple,\'94 the heavy, flat-nosed woman said placidly. \'93That angered the Great Shepherd.\'94 \
\'93This was no god\'92s work,\'94 Dany said coldly. If I look back I am lost. \'93You cheated me. You murdered my child within me.\'94 \
\'93The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\'94 \
\'93I spoke for you,\'94 she said, anguished. \'93I saved you.\'94 \
\'93Saved me?\'94 The Lhazareen woman spat. \'93Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\'92s house burn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my bread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons past. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips. Tell me again what you saved.\'94 \
\'93Your life.\'94 \
Mirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly. \'93Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone.\'94 \
Dany called out for the men of her khas 
\f3 and bid 
\f1 them take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, but the maegi smiled at her as they 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 arried her off, as if they shared a secret. A word, and Dany could have her head off . . . yet then what would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death? \
They led Khal Drogo back to her tent, and Dany commanded them to f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ll a tub, and this time there was no blood in the water. She bathed him herself, washing the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest, cleaning his face w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 th a soft cloth, soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it till it shone again as she remembered. It \
was well past dark before she was done, and Dany was exhausted. She stopped for drink and food, but it w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s all she could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a mouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but she had slept enough . . . too long, in truth. She owed this night to Drogo, for all the nights that had been, and yet might be. \
The memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the darkness, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\'92s life must b
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  done beneath the open sky. She told herself that t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ere were powers stronger than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in Asshai. The night was black and moonless, but overhead a million stars burned bright. She took that for an omen. \
No soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, bare and strewn with stones. No trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water. Dany told herself that the stars would be enough. \'93Remember, Drogo,\'94 she whispered. \'93Remember our first ride together, the day we wed. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around us and your eyes on my face. Remember how cool and clean the water was in the Womb of the World. Remember, my sun-and-stars. Remember, and come
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back to me.\'94 \
The birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would have wanted, but Doreah had taught her o
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 her ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and whispere
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28  and prayed a
\f1 nd told him stories, and by the end she had bathed him with her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise. \
And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he was truly lost to her. \'93When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\'94 she said sadly. \'93When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.\'94 \
Never, the darkness cried, never never never. \
Inside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am lost. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream. \
She knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face. \

TYRION \
They have my son,\'94 Tywin Lannister said. 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93They do, my lord.\'94 The messenger\'92s 
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 oice was dulled by exhaustion. On the breast of his torn surcoat, the brindled boar of Crakehall was half-obscured by dried blood. \
One of your sons, Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, thinking of Jaime. When he lifted his arm, pain shot through his elbow, reminding him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his brother, but he would not have wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gol
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  in Casterly Rock. \
His lord father\'92s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and his
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common room. \
After the hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a single night in an inn had cheered Tyrion mightily . . . though he rather wished it had not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 been this inn 
\f3 again,
\f1  with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace, and it had taken its tol
\f3 l. Men woun
\f1 ded
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the battle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the roadside, men who went t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  sleep
\f3  nev
\f1 er to wake. Every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way. And every evening a few more deserted, stealing off into the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them. \
He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae\'92s body beside him, when his sq
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced marches, the bodies left beside the road . . . all for naught. Robb Stark had reached Riverrun days and days ago. \
\'93How could this happen?\'94 Ser Harys Swyft moaned. \'93How? Even after the Whispering Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great 
\f3 host . .
\f1  . what madness made Ser Jaime
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 decide to split his men into three separate camps? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?\'94 \
Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyri
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 n thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun, \
but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of S
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 yft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters. \

\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 I would have done the same,\'94 his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have. \'93You have never seen Riverrun
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trid
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 nt. The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their slui
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 e gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls ris
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a be
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ieger must needs place one camp north of
\f3  the Tumblestone
\f1 , one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat. There is no other way, none.\'94 \
\'93
\f2\fs24 S
\f1\fs28 er Kevan speaks truly, my lords,\'94 the courier said. \'93We\'92d built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers 
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 utting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 han fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before . . 
\f3 . we
\f1 ll, with what we thoug
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 t was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork, marching south . . . \'94 \
\'93And your outriders?\'94 Ser Gregor Clegane\'92s face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. \'93They saw nothing
\f2\fs24 ?
\f1\fs28  They gave you no warning?\'94 \
The bloodstained messenger shook his head. \'93Our outriders had 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 een vanishing. Marq Piper\'92s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing.\'94 \
\'93A man who se
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 s nothing has no use for his eyes,\'94 the Mountain declared. \'93Cut them out and give them to your n
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 xt outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two . . . and if not, the m
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n after him will have six.\'94 \
Lord
\f3  Tywi
\f1 n Lannister turned his face to st
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 dy Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off his father\'92s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was un
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ouched. \
\'93You 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 aid they came at night,\'94 Ser Kevan prompted. \
The man gave a weary nod. \'93The Blackfish led the v
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault. By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over 
\f3 the ditch
\f1  banks and galloping through the camp with swords an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers. When we heard
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current push
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us 
\f3 with 
\f1 the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 hree others overturned, men swept into the river and drowned . . . and those who did make it across found the Starks wai
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ing for them on the riverbanks.\'94 \
Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what he ha
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  just heard. \'93My lord father\'97\'94 \
\'93Sorry, my lord,\'94 the messenger said. \'93Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned. He was very gallant.\'94 \
He was a fool, Tyrion
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side\'97if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black water. \
\'93The camp between the rivers
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was overrun as well,\'94 the messenger was saying. \'93While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber\'92s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I wasn\'92t there to see, but it\'92s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.\'94 \
\'93Gods
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 save us,\'94 Lord Lefford swore. \
\'93Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off wit
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28  them all. Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.\'94 
\f2\fs24 \

\f1\fs28 \'93Curse the man.\'94 His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. \'93I warned Jaime not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.\'94 \
Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father\'92s shaven head. \
\'93How could it happen?\'94 Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. \'93S
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Jaime taken, the siege broken . . . this is a catastrophe!\'94 \
Ser Addam Marbrand said, \'93I am sure 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 e are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?\'94 \
\'93What can we do? Jaime\'92s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what\'92s to stop them? My lords, we are beaten. W
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  must sue for peace.\'94 \
\'93Peace?\'94 Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. \'93There\'92s your peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard\'92s head. You\'92ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He\'92s winnin
\f3 g .
\f1  . . or hadn\'92t you noticed?\'94 \
\'93Two battles do not make a war,\'94 Ser Addam insisted. \'93We are f
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 r from lost. I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.\'94 \
\'93Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,\'94 off
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 red Lord Lefford. \
\'93Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ut light on those scales,\'94 Tyrion said acidly. \'93And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Ed
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ard\'92s rotting head?\'94 \
\'93I had h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ard that Queen Cersei has the Hand\'92s daughters,\'94 Lefford said hopefully. \'93If we give the la
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  his sisters back . . . \'94 \
Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. \'93He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister\'92s life for two girls.\'94 \
\'93Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,\'94 Lord Lefford said. \
Tyrion rolled his eyes. \'93If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime\'92s armor.\'94 \
\'93if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,\'94 Ser Addarn argued. \'93We should march on them at o
\f3 nce.\'94 \
\'93
\f1 Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,\'94 said Ser Harys. \'93And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.\'94 \
Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. \'93They have my son,\'94 he said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. \'93Leave me. All of you.\'94 \
Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look. \'93Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out.\'94 \
Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks. \'93Uncle,\'94 Tyrion called, \'93if you would be so kind\'97\'94 \
\'93Here.\'94 His father offered him his cu
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 , the wine untouched. Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank. \
Lord Tywin seated himself. \'93Y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 u have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert\'92s brothers. Dead . . . \'94 His hand curled into a fist. \'93Madness. Rank madness.\'94 \
\'93Joff\'92s only a boy,\'94 Tyrion pointed out. \'93At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.\'94 \
His father gave him a sharp look. \'93I suppos
\f3 e we ou
\f1 ght to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 be grateful that he has not yet married a wh
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re.\'94 \
Tyrion sipped at
\f3  his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face. \
\'93Our position is worse than you know,\'94
\f1  his father went on. \'93It would seem we have a new king.\'94 \
Ser Kevan looked poleaxed. \'93A new\'97who? What have they done to Joffrey?\'94 \
The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin\'92s thin lips. 
\f2\fs24 \'93
\f1\fs28 Nothing . . . yet. My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south. Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight pa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 t, and now he has claimed the crown. The bride\'92s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him \
their swords.\'94 \
\'93Those are grave tidings.\'94 When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons. \
\'93My daughter commands us to ride for King\'92s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.\'94 His mouth tightened. \'93Commands us, mind you. In the name of the king and council.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93How is King Joffrey taking the news?\'94 Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement. \
\'93Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,\'94 Lord Tywin said. \'93She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
\'93With what army?\'94 Tyrion asked. \'93You don\'92t plan to give him this one, I hope?\'94 \'93He talks of leading the City Watch,\'94 Lord
\f2\fs24  
\f1 \cf3 Tywin sai\cf2 d.\cf3  \
\'93If he takes th\cf2 e \cf3 Watch
\f2 \cf2 ,
\f1 \cf3  he\'92ll le\cf2 av\cf3 e the city undefen\cf2 de\cf3 d,\'94 S
\f2 \cf2 e
\f0\b\fs38 r Ke
\f2\b0\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 an said. \'93And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone . . . \'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 Lord Tywin looked down at his son. \'93I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.\'94 \
\'93Why, Father,\'94 said Tyrion, \'93that almost sounds like praise.\'94 He leaned forward intently. \'93What of Stannis? He\'92s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel about his brother\'92s claim?
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  \
His father frowned. \'93I have felt f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 om the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Assha
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 . What doe
\f3 s it 
\f1 mean? Is any of it true?\'94 He gave an irritated shrug. \'93Kevan, bring us the map.\'94 \
Ser Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it flat. \'93Jaime h
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s left us in a bad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us. Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle. Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  plague our foraging parties. To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm\'92s End are calling their banners.\'94 \
Tyrion smiled crookedly. \'93Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.\'94 \
\'93I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,\'94 Lord Tywin Lannister said. \
Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. \'93Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now. Their combined power may exceed our own. And with Roose Bolton behind us . . . Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.\'94 \
\'93I have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with young Lord Stark bef
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does not concern me. He is a war
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork. He will be slow to give pursuit. So . . . on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal. Kevan, I want Ser Addam\'92s outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he requires, and send them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.\'94 \
\'93As you say, my lord, but . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. Some call it cursed.\'94 \
\'93Let them,\'94 Lord Tywin said. \'93Unleash Ser Gregor and send him befor
\f3 e u
\f1 s with his reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch. Each is to have three hundred horse. Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.\'94 \
\'93They will burn, my lord,\'94 Ser Kevan said, rising. \'93I shall g
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 ve the commands.\'94 He bowed and made for the door. \
When they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. \'93Your savages might relish a bit of rapine. Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like\'97goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.\'94 \
\'93Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,\'94 Tyrion commented, \'93but I should prefer to keep them with me.\'94 Uncouth and unruly they might be, yet the wildlings were his, and he trusted them more than any of his father\'92s men. He was not about to hand them over. \
\'93Then you had best learn to control them.
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 I will not have the city plundered.\'94 \'93The city?\'94 Tyrion was lost. \'93What city would that be?\'94\
\'93King\'92s Landing. I am sending you to court.\'94 \
It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated. \
He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. \'93And what am I to do there?\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93Rule,\'94 his father said curtly \
Tyrion hooted with laughter. \'93My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!\'94 \
\'93Let her say what she likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all. I blame those jackanapes on the council\'97our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder Lord Varys. W
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 at sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man\'92s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal. Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.\'94 His father had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. \'93And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm. He lent honor to any man he served. Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.\'94 He poin
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 ed a finger at Tyrion\'92s face. \'93If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must. And if these cou
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 cillors are playing us false . . . \'94 \
Tyrion knew. \'93Spikes,\'94 he sighed. \'93Heads. Walls.\'94 \'93I see you have taken a few lessons from me.\'94 \
\'93More than you know, Father,\'94 Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the battle u
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 river, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. \'93Why me?\'94 he asked, cocking his head to one side. \'93Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a . . . bigger man?\'94 \
Lord Tywin rose abruptly. \'93You are my son.\'94 \
That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think Jaime\'92s good as dead, so I\'92m all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still. \
The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father\'92s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room. \'93One last thing,\'94 he said at the door. \'93You will not take the whore to court.\'94 \
Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone. Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower. The ceiling was low, but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard. The innkeep\'92s body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted. Her flesh had gro
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 n as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes. \
Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened. \'93M\'92lord,\'94 she said with a drowsy smile. \
When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r. \'93I have a mind to take you to King\'92s Landing, sweetling,\'94 he whispered. \

JON \
The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. \'93Easy, sweet lady,\'94 he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. \'93Ghost,\'94 he called softly, \'93to me.\'94 And the wolf was there, eyes like embers. \
\'93Jon, please. You must not do this.\'94 \
He mounted, the reins in his hand, and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant\'92s shadow, immense and black. \'93Get
\f3  out of
\f1  my way, Sam.\'94 \
\'93Jon, you can\'92t,\'94 Sam said. \'93I won\'92t 
\f3 let 
\f1 you.\'94\
\'93I would so
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ner not hurt you,\'94 Jon told him. \'93Move aside, Sam, or I\'92ll ride you down.\'94 \'93You won\'92t. You have to listen to me. Please . . . \'94 \
Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night. \
Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn\'92t hurt himsel
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 , falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. \'93I warned him,\'94 Jon said aloud. \'93It was nothing to do with him, anyway.\'94 He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it felt good to have
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the wrappings off. \
Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He \
needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going. \
The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first ligh
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall . . . if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King\'92s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep. \
When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear\'92s breakfast from the kitchen, they\'92d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not s
\f3 o lost to honor as to take
\f1  it with him. Even 
\f3 Jorah Mormont had not don
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son\'92s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn\'92t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 though he were betraying someone. \
Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell t
\f3 hem th
\f1 e gods\'92 will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak. \
When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one hors
\f3 e to s
\f1 ee him through. There were holdfasts and f
\f3 arming
\f1  villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a f
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 esh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown. \
He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he\'92d need to steal t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em. He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon\'92s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all. \
Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind\'92s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the \
towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father\'92s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage\'92s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool. \
But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his father\'92s son, and Robb\'92s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ad chosen honor, but that was him. Even
\f3  now, 
\f1 Jon could not
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well. \
Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he wa
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 ; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, an
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  damned. For the rest of his life\'97however long that might be \'97he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherev
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man\'92s hand be raised against him. But i
\f3 t ma
\f1 de no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  
\f3 place 
\f1 by
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 his brother\'92s side and help avenge his father. \
He remembered Robb as 
\f3 he 
\f1 had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb\'92s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd smile, and he\'92d say . . . he\'92d say . . . \
He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had behead
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d the day they\'92d found the direwolves. \'93You said the words,\'94 Lord Eddard had told him. \'93You took a vow, before your 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 rothers, before the old gods and the new.\'94 Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran\'92s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remember
\f3 ed the
\f1  look on Father\'92s 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 ace when Theon Gre
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28 joy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet. \
He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 h
\f3 e de
\f1 serter had been his broth
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 r Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 have been any different? It must, surely, surely . . . and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or e
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 se . . . \
It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the \
kingsroad, as if to outru
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  
\f3 his do
\f1 ubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common briga
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father\'92s killers. He was no true Stark, had never been one . . . but he coul
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four son
\f3 s, not
\f1  three. \
Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, 
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ed tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike lo
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  He
\f3  vani
\f1 shed behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace. \
Scat

\f1 red through the
\f3  trees ah
\f2\fs24 e
\f3\fs28 ad of him, on both sid

\f3 f the road: Mole\'92s Town. A dog 
\f1 barked as he rode through
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and he heard a mule\'92s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  
\f3 leaking between wooden slats, 
\f1 but only a few. \

\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. E
\f3 ven the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wa
\f1 ll,
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 he\'92d heard men call the whores \'93buried treasures.\'94 He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 breaking too, yet no one seemed to care. \
Not until he
\f3  was well beyond the village did Jon slow again
\f1 . B
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  then both he and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank 
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 f
\f3  melting snow l
\f1 ay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, wate
\f3 r trickling off to form sm
\f1 all shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands toget
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 er, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. Hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad? \
The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two ride
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 s to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been
\f3  tru
\f1 ly stupid, a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die? \
Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. \'93Ghost!\'94 he shouted. \'93Ghost, to me.\'94 The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight. \
Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. G
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. \'93Ghost,\'94 he called again. \'93Where are you? To me! Ghost!\'94 Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, \
unless . . . no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere clos
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  Jon would have surely heard them howling. \
He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He\'92d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he\'92d filc
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ed from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he\'92d need to hunt, and that would slow him. \
Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese whi
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 e his mare grazed along the kingsr
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they\'92d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black . . . \
He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. \'93Ouiet now,\'94 he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole\'92s Town, farmers on th
\f3 eir way to their
\f1  fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night . . . \
He listened to the sound of hooves growing st
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 adily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices drifted through the trees. \
\'93 . . . certain he came this way?\'94 \'93We can\'92t be certain.\'94 \
\'93He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods. That\'92s
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 what I\'92d do.\'94 \
\'93In the dark? Stupid. If you didn\'92t fall off your horse and break your neck, you\'92d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \
\'93I would not.\'94 Grenn sounded peeved. \'93I\'92d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.\'94 \
\'93Wha
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  if the sky was cloudy?\'94 Pyp asked. \'93Then I wouldn\'92t go.\'94 \
Another voice broke in. \'93You know where I\'92d be if it was me? I\'92d be in Mole\'92s Town, digging for buried treasure.\'94
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Toad\'92s shrill laughter boomed throu
\f3 gh t
\f1 he trees. Jon\'92s mare snorted. \
\'93Keep quiet, a
\f3 ll o
\f1 f you,\'94 Haider said. \'93I thought I heard something.\'94 \'93Where? I didn\'92t hear anything.
\f2\fs24 \'94
\f1\fs28  The horses stopped.\
\'93You can\'92t hear yourself fart.\'94\
\'93I can too,\'94 Grenn insisted. \
\'93Quiet!\'94 \
They all fell silent,
\f3  list
\f1 ening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He hadn\'92t
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn\'92t gone to bed either, he
\f3 \'92d wo
\f1 ken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they\'92d be named d
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 serters too. What did they think they were doing? \
The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. \'93What did you hear?\'94 \
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 Haider admitted. \'93A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but . . .
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 \'94 \'93There\'92s nothing here.\'94 \
Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimps
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon\'92s mare started and gave a whinny. \'93Ther
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 !
\f3 \'94 Ha
\f1 lder shouted. \
\'93I 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 eard it too!\'94 \
\'93Traitor,\'94 Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare\'92s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet. \
\'93Jon!\'94 Pyp shouted after him. \
\'93Pull up,\'94 Grenn said. \'93You can\'92t outrun us all.\'94 \
Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. \'93Get back. I don\'92t w
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 sh to hurt you, b
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 t I will if I have to.\'94 \
\'93One against seven?\'94 Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him. \'93What do you want
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with me?\'94 Jon demanded.\
\'93W
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  want to take you back where you belong,\'94 Pyp said.\
\'93I belong with my brother.\'94 \
\'93We\'92re your brothers now,\'94 Grenn said.\
\'93They\'92ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,\'94 Toad put in with a nervous laugh. \
\'93This is so stupid, it\'92s like something the Aurochs would do.\'94\
\'93I would not,\'94 Grenn said. \'93I\'92m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.\'94 \
\'93So did I,\'94 Jon told them. \'93Don\'92t you understand? They mu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 dered my father. It\'92s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands\'97\'94 \
\'93We k
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ow,\'94 said Pyp solemnly. \'93Sam told us everything.\'94 \
\'93We\'92re sorry about your father,\'94 Grenn said, \'93but it doesn\'92t matter. Once you say the words, you can\'92t l
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ave, no matter what.\'94 \
\'93I have to,\'94 Jon said fervently.\
\'93You said the words,\'94 Pyp reminded him. \'93Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall \
not end until my death.\'94\
\'93I shall live and die at my post,\'94 Grenn added, nodding. \
\'93You don\'92t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.\'94 He was angry now. Why couldn\'92t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder. \
\'93I am the sword in the darkness,\'94 Halder intoned. \'93The watcher on the walls,\'94 piped Toad. \
Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, \'93I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, t
\f2\fs24 h
\f3\fs28 e shield that g
\f1 uards the realms of m
\f3 en.\'94 \
\'93Stay back,\'94 Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. \'93I mean it, Pyp.\'94 T
\f1 hey weren\'92t even wearing armor, he could cut
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 them to pieces if he had to. \
Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. \'93I pledge my life and honor to the Night\'92s Watch.\'94 \
Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing from every side. \
\'93For this night . . . \'94 Halder trotted in from the left.\
\'93 . . . and all the nights to come,\'94 finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon\'92s reins. \'93So here \
are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.\'94\
Jon lifted his sword . . . and lowered it, helpless. \'93Damn you,\'94 he said. \'93Damn you all.\'94 \
\'93Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you\'92ll ride back peaceful?\'94 asked Halder. \
\'93I won\'92t run, if that\'92s what you mean.\'94 Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him. \'93Small h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 l
\f3 p you w
\f1 ere,\'94 he said. The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly. \
\'93We had best hurry,
\f3 \'94 Pyp said. \'93If 
\f1 we\'92
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 e not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.\'94 \
Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was 
\f3 elsewhere. Pyp set
\f1  the pace, g
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 lloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole\'92s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 n hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity
\f3  of the Wall. 
\f1 It did not seem like
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 home this time. \
They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain\
here . . . and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would \
avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  high passes. That was the wildling\'92s way, hard and perilous, but at leas
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  no one wouid follow him. He wouldn\'92t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad. \
Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. \'93I . . . I\'92m glad they found you, Jon.\'94 \
\'93I\'92m not,\'94 Jon said, dismounting. \
Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. \'93Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,\'94 the small boy said. \'93We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.\'94 \
When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear\'92s breakfast. Today it
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham 
\f3 steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. J
\f1 on car
\f3 ried the food back to the King\'92s Tower. He found Mormont at the window 
\f1 seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, m
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 ttering, \'93Corn, corn, corn.\'94 The bird shrieked when Jon 
\f2\fs24 e
\f1 \cf3 ntered. \'93\cf2 Pu\cf3 t the food on the \cf2 ta\cf3 ble,\'94
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 the Old B\cf2 ea\cf3 r said, glancing u\cf2 p.\cf3  \'93I\'92l
\f2 \cf2 l
\f0\b\fs38  have so
\f2\b0\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 e beer.\'94 \
Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he sti
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l had his own teeth. \
\'93Doubtless you loved your father,\'94 Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. \'93The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?\'94 \
\'93I remember,\'94 Jon said sullenly. He did not care 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 o talk of his father\'92s death, not even to Mormont. \
\'93See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my plate. Is it ham again? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?\'94 \
Jon\'92s throat was dry. \'93You know?\'94\
\'93Know,\'94 the raven echoed from Mormont\'92s shoulder. \'93Know.\'94\
The Old Bear snorted. \'93Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night\'92s \
Watch because I\'92m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you\'92d go. I told him you\'92d be back. I know my men . . . and my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad . . . and honor brought you back.\'94 \
\'93My frie
\f3 nds brou
\f1 ght me
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 back,\'94 Jon said.\
\'93Did I say it was your honor?\'94 Mormont inspected his plate. \'93They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?\'94 \
\'93If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.\'94 Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit. \'93I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?\'94 \
\'93No.\'94 Jon felt like a fool.\
\'93Pity, we could use a horse like that.\'94 \
Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least. \'93I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I\'92m not afraid t
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28  die.\'94 \
\'93Die!\'94 the raven cried. \
\'93Nor live, I hope,\'94 Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird. \'93You have not deserted\'97yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole\'92s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?\'94 \
Jon kept silent. \
\'93I thought so.\'94 Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. \'93Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 he answered, sullen. \
\'93Good,\'94 Mormont said. \'93We\'92ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it\'92s not something I care to see again.\'94 He ate the egg in t
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 o bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. \'93Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 . Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you\'92ll find in all the Night\'92s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a \
mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?\'94 \
Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke. \
The Old Bear sighed. \'93You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, m
\f2\fs24 y
\f1\fs28  sister is marching in your brother\'92s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men\'92s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear y
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ur half sisters.\'94 Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. \'93Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I\'92d still grieve 
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 f she were slain, yet you don\'92t see me running off. I said the words, just as you did. My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?\'94 \
I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I\'92m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 not even a father. The words would not come
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  \'93I don\'92t know.\'94 \
\'93I do,\'94 said Lord Commander Mormont. \'93The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e\'92s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we\'92ve lost this past year?\'94 \
\'93Ben Jen,\'94 the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. \'93Ben Jen. Ben Jen.\'94 \
\'93No,\'94 Jon said. There had been others. Too many.\
\'93Do you think your
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 brother\'92s war is more important than ours?\'94 the old man barked. Jon chewed his lip. Th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  raven flapped its wings at him. \'93War, war, war, war,\'94 it sang. \
\'93It\'92s not,\'94 Mormont told him. \'93Gods save us, boy, you\'92re not blind 
\f3 and you\'92re not stupid. W
\f1 hen dead m
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n come hunting in the 
\f3 night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?\'94
\f1  \
\'93No.\'94 Jon had not thought of it that way. \
\'93
\f2\fs24 Y
\f1\fs28 our lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?\'94 \'93Why? Why? Why?\'94 the raven called. \
\'93All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it\'92s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours . . . he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I\'92m not.\'94 Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the poi
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 t of his dagger. \'93I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.\'94 \
His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon\'92s back. \'93Beyond the Wall?\'94 \
\'93You heard me. I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.\'94 He chewed and swallowed. \'93I will not sit here mee
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 ly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the Night\'92s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the- Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there. I mean to comman
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  them myself.\'94 He pointed his dagger at Jon\'92s chest. \'93By custom, the Lord Commander\'92s steward is his squire as w
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ll . . . but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you\'92ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night\'92s Watch . . . or only a bastard boy who w
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nts to play at war?\'94 \
Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath. Forgive me, Father. Robb, Arya, Bran . . . forgive me, I cannot help you. He has the truth of it. This is my place. \'93I am . . . yours, my lord. Your man. I swear it. I will not run again.\'94 \
The Old Bear snorted. \'93Good. Now go put on your sword.\'94 \

CATELYN \
It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun, crossing the Tumblestone in a small 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 oat to begin their journey north to Winterfell. And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy wore plate and mai
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28  in place of swaddling clothes. \
Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwol
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  s head as the rowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark. \
Catelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push them past the looming Wheel Tower. The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn\'92s face. From the sandstone 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 alls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted down her name, and Robb\'92s, and \'93Winterfell!\'94 From every ram
\f2\fs24 p
\f1\fs28 art waved the banner of House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red f
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 eld. It
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 was a stirring sight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again. Oh, Ne
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  . . . \
Below the Wheel Tower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water. The me
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28  put their backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy chains a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  the great iron portcullis was winch
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ow deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced. Thought
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  like that were seldom far from her mind these days. \
They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, 
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28 oving from sunlight to sha
\f2\fs24 d
\f3\fs28 ow and back into sun
\f1 light. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron rings set
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 in the stone. Her 
\f3 father\'92s g
\f1 uards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his bl
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28 e-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood, a hard pike
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His bright ye
\f3 ll
\f1 ow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from \
raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord Tytos who led
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister camp. \
\'93Bring them in,\'94 Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee- deep in the water
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on his face. Theon
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots. \
Edmure came down t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e steps to embrace her. \'93Sweet sister,\'94 he murmured hoarsely. He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 attle and haggard from strain. His 
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 eck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely. \
\'93Your grief is mine, Cat,\'94 he said wh
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 n they broke apart. \'93When we heard about Lord E
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 dard . . . the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.\'94 \
\'93Will that bring Ned back to me?\'94 she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for sof
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 er words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  It would not do. She had to be strong. \'93All th
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 t will keep. I must see Father.\'94 \
\'93He awaits you in his solar,\'94 Edmure said. \
\'93Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,\'94 her father\'92s steward explained. When had that good man grown so old and grey? \'93He instructed me to bring you to him at once.\'94 \
\'93I\'92ll take her.\'94 Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, \'93Ho
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28  bad is he?\'94 dreading the answer even as she said the words. \
Edmure\'92s look was somber. \'93He will not be
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 with us long, the maesters say. T
\f3 he pain is . . . constant, and grievous.\'94 \
A blind rage filled her, a 
\f1 rage a
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her. \'93You should have told me,\'94 she said. \'93You should have sent word as soon as you knew.\'94 \
\'93He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm \
so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was . . . \'94\
\'93 . . . they might attack?\'94 Cat
\f3 elyn finished, hard. It was your doing, 
\f1 yours, a voice \
whispered inside her. If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 . . . They climbed the spiral stair in silence. \
The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster\'92s solar was triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her father\'92s bed out onto the balcony. \'93He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,\'94 Edmure explained. \'93Father, see who I\'92ve brought. Cat has come to see you . . . \'94 \
Hoster Tully had always been a
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow. \
His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure\'92s voice. \'93Little cat,\'94 he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain. \'93My little cat.\'94 A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers. \'93I watched for you . . . \'94 \
\'93I shall leave you to talk,\'94 her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew. \
Catelyn knelt and took her father\'92s ha
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d in hers. It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. \'93You should have told me,\'94 she said. \'93A rider, a raven . . . \'94 \
\'93Riders are taken, questioned,\'94 he answered. \'93Ravens are brought down . . . \'94 A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. \'93The crabs are in my\
belly . . . pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, 
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 he crabs. Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy . . . I sleep a lot . . . but I wanted to be awa
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28 e to see you, when you came. I was afraid . . . when the Lannisters took you
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  brother, the camps all around us . . . was afraid I would go, before I could see you again . . . I was afraid . . . \'94 \
\'93I\'92m here, Father,\'94 she said. \'93With Robb, my son. He\'92ll wan
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  to see you too.\'94 \'93Your boy,\'94 he whispered. \'93He had my eyes, I remember . . . \'94 \
\'93He did, and does. And we\'92ve brought you Jaime La
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 nister, in irons. Riverrun is free again, Father.\'94 \
Lord Hoster smiled. \'93I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them . . . had to see. They carried me to the gatehouse . . . watched from the battlements. Ah, that was\
beautiful . . . the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the\
river . . . sweet cries . . . when that siege tower went up, gods . . . would have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first. Was it your boy who did it? Was it your Robb?\'94 \
\'93Yes,\'94 Catelyn said, fiercely proud. \'93It was Robb . . . and Brynden. Your brother is here as well, my lord.\'94 \
\'93Him.\'94 Her father\'92s voice was a faint whisper. \'93The Blackfish . . . came back? From the Vale?\'94 \
\'93Yes.\'94 \
\'93And Lysa?\'94 A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. \'93Gods be good
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  your sister . . . did she come as well?\'94 \
He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. \'93No. I\'92m sorry . . . \'94 \
\'93Oh.\'94 His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. \'93I\'92d hoped I would have liked to see her, before . . . \'94 \
\'93She\'92s with her son, in the Eyrie.\'94 \
Lord Hoster gave a weary nod. \'93Lord Robert now, poor Arryn\'92s gone . . . I remember . . . why did she not come with you?\'94 \
\'93She is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.\'94 She kissed his wrinkled brow. \'93Robb will be waiting. Will you s
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 e him? And Brynden?\'94 \
\'93Your son,\'94 he whispered. \'93Yes. Cat\'92s child . . . he had my eyes, I remember. When he was born. Bring him . . . yes.\'94 \
\'93And your brother?\'94\
Her father glanced out over the rivers. \'93Blackfish,\'94 he said. \'93Has he wed yet? Taken \
some . . . girl
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to wife?\'94 \
Even on his deat
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 bed, Catelyn thought sadly. \'93He has not wed. You know that, Father. Nor will he ever.\'94 \
\'93I told him . . . commanded him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to make his match. A good match. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet girl, pretty . . . freckles . . . Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waitin
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 . Yes. Still . . . \'94 \
\'93Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,\'94 Catelyn reminded him. \'93She has three children by him.\'94 \
\'93Even so,\'94 Lord Hoster muttered. \'93Even so. Spit on the girl. The Redwynes. Spit on me. His lord, his brother . . . that Blackfish. I had other offers. Lord Bracken\'92s girl. Walder Frey . . . any of three, he said . . . Has he wed? Anyone? Anyone?\'94 \
\'93No one,\'94 Catelyn said, \'93yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back to Riverrun. I would not be here now, if Ser Brynden had not helped us.\'94 \
\'93He was ever a warrior,\'94 her father husked. \'93That he could do. Knight of the Gate, yes.\'94 He leaned back and closed his eyes, inutterably weary. \'93Send him. Later. I\'92ll sleep now. Too sick to fight. Send him up later, the Blackfish . . . \'94 \
Catelyn kisse
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep, with his rivers flowing beneath. He was a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 leep before she left the solar. \
When she returned to the lower bailey, Ser Brynden Tully stood on
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 the water stairs with wet boots, talking with the captain of Riverrun\'92s guards. He came to her at once. \'93Is he\'97\'94 \
\'93Dying,\'94 she said. \'93As we feared.\'94 \
Her uncle\'92s craggy face showed his pain plain. He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair. \'93Will he see me?\'94 \
She nodded. \'93He says he is too si
\f2\fs24 c
\f1\fs28 k to fight.\'94 \
Brynden Blackfish chuckled. \'93I am too old 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  soldier to believe that. Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, dam
\f3 n his bo
\f1 nes.\'94 \
Catelyn smiled, knowing it was true. \'93I do not see Robb.\'94 \
\'93He went with Greyjoy to the ha
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l, I believe.\'94 \
Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Ri
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 errun\'92s Gr
\f3 eat Hal
\f1 l, enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her father\'92s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood. \'93Some tried to flee, but we\'92d pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness w
\f3 ith
\f1  sword and lance. The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb\'92s got in among them. I saw him tear one man\'92s arm from his shoulder, and their horses went
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 mad 
\f1 at the scent of him. I couldn\'92t tell you how many men were thrown\'97\'94 \
\'93Theon,\'94 she interrupted, \'93where might I find my son?\'94 \'93Lord Robb went
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 to visit the godswood, my lady.\'94 \
It was what Ned would have done. He is his father\'92s son as much a
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  mine, I must remember. Oh, gods, Ned . . . \
She found
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in 
\f3 the e
\f1 arth, his glov
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others knelt: Greatjon Umber, Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. Even Tytos Blackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind him. These are the ones who keep the old gods, she realized. She asked herself what gods she kept these days, and could not find an answer. \
It would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their due . 
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  . even cruel gods who would take Ned from
\f3  her, a
\f1 nd her lord father as well. So Catelyn waited. The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to her right, ivy crawling up its side. As she st
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 od there, all the memories came fl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 oding back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees, and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm, and over there, beneath that bower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr. \
She had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been\'97
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 he no older than Sansa, Lysa younger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The girls had traded him between them, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr had liked to chew it. He had been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. \'93He tried to put his tongue in my mouth,\'94 Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when they were alone. \'93He did with me too,\'94 Lysa had whispered, shy and breathless. \'93I liked it.\'94 \
Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must have. She
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as eight
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 en . . . he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 iped them away angrily. \
\'93Mother,\'94 Robb said when he saw her st
\f3 anding 
\f1 there. \'93We must call a council. There are things to be decided.\'94 \
\'93Your grandfather would like to see you,\'94 she said. \'93Robb, he\'92s very sick.\'94 \
\'93Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother . . . for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet first we must meet. We\'92ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has cl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 imed his brother\'92s crown.\'94 \
\'93Renly?\'94 she said, shocked. \'93I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis . . . \'94 \'93So did we all, my lady,\'94 Galbart Glover said. \
The war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square. Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth. Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father\'92s bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the 
\f2\fs24 v
\f1\fs28 ictory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 e Trident, drawing them back. Karyl Vance came in, a lord now, his father dead beneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun\'92s son, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28  lad no older than Bran. Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge, glowering and blustering, and took a seat 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 s far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit. \
The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the tables. They were fewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb\'92s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Mormont were to the right of Catelyn. Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead in the Whispering
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 Wood, and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against Tywin Lan
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ister on the Green Fork. \
The arguing raged on late i
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 to the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and speak they did . . . and shout, and curse, and reason, and caj
\f3 ole, an
\f1 d jest, and bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn \
sat and listened to it all. \
Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 mouth of the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin\'92s army had crossed the Tri
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ent, and was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement. \
Many of the l
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 r
\f3 ds banner
\f1 men wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton\'92s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed
\f3 , as e
\f1 ver; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to i
\f3 nsi
\f1 st they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move 
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 outh to join their might to his. \
\'93Renly is not the
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 king,\'94 Robb said. It
\f3  was t
\f1 he first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen. \
\'93You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,\'94 Galbart Glover said. \'93He put your father to death.\'94 \
\'93That makes him evil
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28 \'94 Robb replied. \'93I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert\'92s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.\'94 \
\'93Tommen is no less a Lannister,\'94 Ser Marq Piper snapped. \
\'93As you say,\'94 said Robb, troubled. \'93Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He\'92s Robert\'92s younger brother. Bran can\'92t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can\'92t be king 
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 efore Lord Stannis.\'94 \
Lady Mormont agreed. \'93Lord S
\f3 tannis has the better 
\f1 cl
\f2\fs24 a
\f1 \cf3 im.\'94 \
\'93R\cf2 en\cf3 ly is crowned,\'94 sa\cf2 id\cf3  Marq
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 Piper. \'93H\cf2 ig\cf3 hgarden and Storm\'92
\f2 \cf2 s
\f0\b\fs38  End supp
\f2\b0\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 rt his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, \
all of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?\'94 \
\'93The right,\'94 said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it. \
\'93So you mean us to declare 
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28 or Stannis?\'94 asked Edmure. \
\'93I don\'92t know,\'94 said Robb. \'93I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.\'94 \
\'93My lord father would urge caution
\f3 ,\'94 age
\f1 d Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile
\f3  of 
\f1 a Frey. \'93Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppo
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 e him, as we choose
\f3 . Wit
\f1 h Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce . . . and the safe return of his son. No
\f2\fs24 b
\f1\fs28 le lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms . . . \'94 \
A roar of outrage drowned out his voice. \'93Craven!\'94 the Greatjon thundered. \'93Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,\'94 declared Lady Mormont. \'93Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,\'94 shouted Rickard Karstark. \
\'93Why not a peace?\'94 Catelyn asked. \
The lords looked at her, but it was Robb\'92s eyes sh
\f3 e felt
\f1 , his and his alone. \'93My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband,\'94 he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the rough wood. \'93This is the only peace I have for Lannisters.\'94 \
The Greatjon bellowed his approval, and 
\f3 othe
\f1 r men added their voices, shouting and drawing swords and poun
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ing their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had quieted. \'93My lords,\'94 she said then, \'93Lord Ed
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 ard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 than you?\'94 Her voic
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. \'93Robb, if that s
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ord could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more . . . but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark\'92s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?\'94 \
\'93You are a woman, my lady,\'94 the Greatjon r
\f3 umbled in hi
\f1 s deep voice. \'93Women do not understand these things.\'94 \
\'93You are the gentle sex,\'94 said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. \'93A man has a need for ven
\f3 geance.\'94
\f1  \
\'93Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord
\f3  Karst
\f1 ark
\f2\fs24 ,
\f1\fs28  and you would see how gentle a woman can be,\'94 Catelyn replied. \'93Perhaps I do not under
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28 tand tactics and strategy . . . but I understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord\'92s freedom. \
\'93Well, the one is done, 
\f2\fs24 a
\f1\fs28 nd the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 f I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and than
\f2\fs24 k
\f1\fs28  the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father\'92s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband.\'94 \
The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking. \
\'93Peace,\'94 said her uncle Brynden. \'93Peace is sweet, my lady . . . but on what terms? It is no good hammering your sword into a pl
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 wshare if you mu
\f3 st forge
\f1  it again on the morrow.\'94 \
\'93What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones?\'94 asked Rickard Karstark. \
\'93Aye,\'94 said Lord Bracken. \'93Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we fought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?\'94 \
Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn\'92s surprise and dismay. \'93And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we
\f3  not
\f1  then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where
\f3  w
\f1 ould that leave us?\'94 \
\'93Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never ca
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 l a Lannister my king,\'94 declared Mar
\f2\fs24 q
\f1\fs28  Piper. \
\'93Nor I!\'94 yelled the little Darry boy. \'93I never will!\'94 
\f3 \
Again 
\f1 the shouting began. Catelyn sat despairing. She had come so close, she thought. They had alm
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 st listened, almost . . . but the moment was gone. The
\f3 re would be no peace, no
\f1  chance to heal, no safety. She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war. H
\f3 e 
\f1 had pledged himself to \
marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword h
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  had laid on the table. \
Catelyn was thinking of her girls, wondering if she would ever s
\f3 ee them a
\f1 gain, when
\f3  t
\f1 he 
\f2\fs24 G
\f1\fs28 reatjon lurched to his feet. \
\'93MY LORDS!\'94 he shouted, his voice booming off th
\f3 e raft
\f1 ers. \'93Here is what I say to these two kings!\'94 He spat. \'93 Renly Baratheon is nothin
\f3 g 
\f1 to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgar
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28 en or Dor
\f3 ne? What
\f1  do they know of the Wall or
\f3  the 
\f1 wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I\'92ve had a bellyful of them.\'94 He reached back ove
\f3 r his should
\f1 er and drew his immense tw
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 -handed greatsword. \'93Why shouldn\'92t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!\'94 He pointed at Robb with the blade. \'93There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m\'92lords,\'94 he thundered. \'93The King in the North!\'94 \
And he knelt, and laid his sword at her son\'92s feet. \
\'93I\'92ll have peace on those terms,\'94 Lord Karstark said. \'93They can keep th
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ir red castle and their iron chair as well.\'94 He eased his longsword from its scabbard. \'93The King in the North!\'94 he said, kneeling beside the G

\f1\fs28 eatjon. \
Maege Mormont stood. \'93The King o
\f2\fs24 f
\f1\fs28  Winter!\'94 she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the swords. And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 draw their blades, bending thei
\f3 r knees a
\f1 nd shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one . . . yet now were heard again, ringing from the timber

DAENERYS \
The land was red and dead and parched, and good wood was hard to come by. Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods, purple brush, sheaves of brown grass. They took the two straightest trees, hacked the limbs and branches from them, skinned off their bark, and split them, laying the logs in a square. Its center they filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to t
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 em; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo\'92s red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes. \
Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. \'93It is not enough to kill a horse,\'94 she told Dany. \'93By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to fin
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child\'92s ignorance. Whatever you mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.\'94 \
\'93I am tired of the maegi\'92s braying,\'94 Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife kept silent. \
Over the carcass of the horse, they built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater, and the thickest straightest branches they could find. They lai
\f3 d the wood east to west, f
\f1 rom sunrise to 
\f3 sunset. On the platform they piled Khal Drogo\'92s treasures: his great tent, his painted vests, his saddles a
\f1 nd har
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 ess, the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood, the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo\'92s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well, but she forbade it. \'93Those are mine,\'94 she told him, \'93and I mean to keep them.\'94 Another layer of brush was piled about the khal\'92s treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered over them. \
Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith. \'93Princess . . . \'94 he began. \
\'93Why do yo
\f2\fs24 u
\f1\fs28  call me that?\'94 Dany challenged him. \'93My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?\'94 \
\'93He was, my lady.\'94 \
\'93Viserys is dead. I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen. Whatever was his is mine now.\'94 \
\'93My . . . queen,\'94 Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. \'93My sword that was his is
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 yours, Dacnerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but exile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. I promise you, no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak un
\f2\fs24 l
\f1\fs28 ess you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khalee
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 . Come east with me. Yi Ti, Qarth, the Jade Sea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not. Do not.\'94 \
\'93I must,\'94 Dany told him. She touch
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 d his face, fondly, sadly. \'93You do not understand.\'94 \
\'93I understand that you loved him,\'94 Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. \'93I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo\'92s pyre. I will not watch you burn.\'94 \
\'93Is that what you fear?\'94 Dany kissed hi
\f2\fs24 m
\f1\fs28  lightly on his broad forehead. \'93I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.\'94 \
\'93You do not mean to die with him? You sw
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 ar it, my queen?\'94 \
\'93I swear it,\'94 she said in the Common Tongue of the Se
\f3 ven Ki
\f1 ngdoms that by rights were 
\f2\fs24 h
\f1\fs28 ers. \
The third level of the platform was w
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 ven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry leaves and twigs. They laid them north to south, from ice to
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fire, and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many had Aegon started with? she 
\f2\fs24 w
\f1\fs28 ondered. It did not matter. \
\'93You will be my khalasar,\'94 she told them. \'93I see the faces of slaves. I fre
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.\'94 The black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. \'93I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the aged. I 
\f3 was a
\f1  child yesterday. Today I am a woman. Tomorrow I will be old. To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place fo
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28  you.\'94 She turned to the three young warriors of her khas. \'93Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and
\f3  ask 
\f1 your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at \
my side to keep me safe from harm.\'94 \
Jhogo took the whip from her hands, but hi
\f2\fs24 s
\f1\fs28  face was confused. \'93Kh
\f3 alees
\f1 i, \'93 he said hesitantly, \'93this is not done. It would shame me, to be bloodrider to a woman.\'94 \
\'93Aggo,\'94 Dany called, paying no heed to Jhogo\'92s words. If I look back I am lost. \'93To you I give the dra
\f2\fs24 g
\f1\fs28 onbone bow that was my bride gift.\'94 It was double-curved, shiny black and exquisite, taller than she was. \'93I name you ko, and ask your oath, that you should live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\'94 \
Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes. \'93I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko.\'94 \
\'93Rakharo,\'94 Dany said, turning away from the refusal, \'93you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift, with hilt and blade chased in gold. And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\'94 \
\'93You are khaleesi,\'94 Rakharo said, taking the arakh. \'93I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains, and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen. No m
\f2\fs24 o
\f1\fs28 re can I promise.\'94 \
She nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions.
\f3  \'93Ser
\f1  Jorah Mormont,\'94 she said, \'93first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.\'94 \
\'93You have it, my queen,\'94 Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. \'93I vow to s
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28 rve you, to obey you, to die for you if need be.\'94 \
\'93Whatever may come?\'94 \'93Whatever may come.\'94 \
\'93I shall hold you to that oath. I pray you never regret the giving of it.\'94 Dany lifted him to his feet. Stretching on her toes to reach his lips, she kissed the knight gently and said, \'93You are the first of my Queensguard.\'94 \
She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent. The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes. They thought her mad, Dany realized. Perhaps she was. She would know soon \
enough. If I look back I am lost. \
Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud. She liked the heat. 
\f2\fs24 I
\f1\fs28 t made her feel clean. Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed her hair and combed it out, working loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed her back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs. She shuddered when it entered
\f3  her, and her pain and
\f1  stiffness seemed to dissolve. She floated. \
When she was clean, her handmaids helped her from the water. Irri and Jhiqui
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fanned her dry, while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wris
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28 , behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. The last dab was for her sex. Irri\'92s finger felt as light and cool as a lover\'92s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips. \
Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. His hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried he
\f3 r face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils.
\f1  H
\f2\fs24 e
\f1\fs28  smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses. He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought. Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do. I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high . . . \
Dany b
\f3 rai
\f1 ded his hair an
\f3 d s
\f1 lid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one. So many bells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with
\f2\fs24  
\f1\fs28 fear. She dr
\f3 essed
\f1  him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one Drogo had loved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up her legs, and a vest like Drogo\'92s. \
The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the
\f2\fs24  
\f3\fs28 tent. Dany walked behind th
\f1 em
\f2\fs24 .
\f1\fs28  They laid him down on h
\f3 is cu
\f1 shions and silks, his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast. \
\'93Oil,\'94 she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance. \'93
\f3 Br
\f1 ing my eggs,\'94 Dany commanded 
\f3 \
her handmaids. Something in her voice made them run. \
Ser Jorah took her arm. \'93My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon\'92s eggs in the night lands. Better to sell them
\f1  in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days.\'94 \
\'93They were not given to me to sell,\'94 Dany told h
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 m. \
She c
\f3 limbed
\f1  the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-a
\f2\fs24 n
\f1\fs28 d-stars. The black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it. The cream-and-gold down between his legs. When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips. \
As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \'93You are mad,\'94 the godswife sa
\f2\fs24 i
\f1\fs28 d hoarsely. \
\'93Is it so far from madness to wisdom?\'94 Dany asked. \'93Ser Jorah, take this maegi and bind her to the pyre.\'94 \
\'93To the . . . my queen, no, hear me . . . \'94 \
\'93Do as I say.\'94 Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. \'93You swore to obey me, whatever might come. Rakharo, help him.\'94 \
The godswife did no
\f2\fs24 t
\f1\fs28  cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo\'92s pyre and s
\f3 taked
\f1  her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil
\f3  over 
\f1 the woman\'92s head herself. \'93I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,\'94 she said, \'93for the lessons you have taught me.\'94 \
\'93You will not hear me scream,\'94 Mirri responded as the oil d
\f2\fs24 r
\f1\fs28 ipped from her hair and soaked her clothing. \
\'93I will,\'94 Dany said, \'93but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.\'94 Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she steppe
\f2\fs24 d
\f1\fs28  away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from th
\f3 e maeg
\f1 i\'92s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star. \
When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into the night lands. The bodies are bu
\f2\fs24 r
\f1 \cf3 ned benea\cf2 th\cf3  the open sky, and
\f2 \cf2  
\f1 \cf3 the khal rises on \cf2 hi\cf3 s fie
\f2 \cf2 r
\f0\b\fs38 y steed to take 
\f2\b0\fs24 h
\f4\fs28 is place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness. \
Jhogo spied it first. \'93There,\'94 he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\'92s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign. \
Dany took the torch from Aggo\'92s hand and thrust it between the logs. The oil took the fire at once, the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went darting up th
\f3 e wood like swif
\f4 t 
\f2\fs24 r
\f4\fs28 ed mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, sof
\f2\fs24 t
\f4\fs28  and sudden as a lover\'92s breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The wood crackled,
\f2\fs24  
\f4\fs28 louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shr
\f2\fs24 i
\f4\fs28 ll, ululating voice. The flames whirled a
\f2\fs24 n
\f4\fs28 d writhed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itsel
\f2\fs24 f
\f4\fs28  seemed to liquefy from the heat. Dany heard
\f2\fs24  
\f5 l
\f6 \cf0 ogs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller . . . then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony. \
And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany\'92s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever. \
She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\'92s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her. \
She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn. \
Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets \
over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now. \
Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing. \
She heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder. \
Only death can pay for life. \
And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\'92t you see? Don\'92t you SEE? With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her children. \
The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world. \
When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away . . . yet she was unhurt. \
The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. Her arms cradled them close. The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin. When it saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals. \
Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas came up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet. \'93Blood of my blood,\'94 he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth. \'93Blood of my blood,\'94 she heard Aggo echo. \'93Blood of my blood,\'94 Rakharo shouted. \
And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all the Dothraki, men and women and children, and Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now, today and tomorrow and forever, hers as they had never been Drogo\'92s. \
As Daenerys Targaryen rose to her feet, her black hissed, pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils. The other two pulled away from her breasts and added their voices to the call, translucent wings unfolding and stirring the air, and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons. \

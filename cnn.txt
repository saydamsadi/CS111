\f0\fs24 \cf0 Attorney General William Barr is no longer expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, the committee's chairman Jerry Nadler announced, following a dispute between House Democrats and the nation's top law enforcement officer over whether Barr would publicly face questions from committee staff.\
\
In comments to reporters on Capitol Hill, Nadler also said the Justice Department told the committee it would not comply with its subpoena for the full, unredacted report from special counsel Robert Mueller, a subpoena which had a deadline of Wednesday to comply.\
The decision by Barr to skip the hearing comes after Democrats on the committee demanded that the attorney general face questions from the committee's lawyers, a decision formalized by a vote Wednesday. Nadler did not rule out issuing a subpoena for Barr's testimony Thursday, though he didn't commit to doing so, saying obtaining the report was the main focus.\
"He's trying to blackmail the committee," Nadler said of Barr's unwillingness to appear. "The administration cannot dictate the terms of our hearing in our hearing room."\
Nadler also said the committee is considering May 15 as a possible date for Mueller to testify.\

Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec confirmed that Barr would not attend Thursday's hearing and said the department would continue working with the committee on oversight requests.\
"Unfortunately, even after the Attorney General volunteered to testify, Chairman Nadler placed conditions on the House Judiciary Committee hearing that are unprecedented and unnecessary," Kupec said in a statement. "Congress and the Executive branch are co-equal branches of government, and each have a constitutional obligation to respect and accommodate one another's legitimate interests."\
Barr had previously objected to the proposal for lawyers to ask questions in the hearing, but after the committee formalized its move on Wednesday to allot time for staff questioning, the Department of Justice communicated to the committee that Barr will not appear, according to a committee aide.\
Separately, Barr testified for hours before the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\
The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee blamed Nadler for Barr's decision to skip the hearing.\
"It's a shame Members of the House Judiciary Committee won't get the opportunity to hear from Attorney General Barr this Thursday, because Chairman Nadler chose to torpedo our hearing," Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia said in a statement Wednesday.\
The committee voted earlier Wednesday to allow staff to question Barr during his hearing on the special counsel's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The vote was 21 to 14.\
"I don't know what he's afraid of," Nadler said earlier.\

Cast members of Game of Thrones surpassed the expectations of an 88-year-old hospice patient in Providence, Rhode Island.\
\
Claire Walton jokingly told her care team that she wanted to meet the cast of her favorite show before she died. Realizing that was a bit far-fetched, she amended her request, saying she just hoped she could watch the third episode.\
Her wish came true on Sunday, CNN affiliate WJAR reported, when she watched the Battle of Winterfell -- accompanied by videos from 10 different cast members talking to her.\
Syrio Forel, Ser Davos Seaworth, Pypar, Ser Meryn Trant, a White Walker, Qhono and more. All sending Walton some love.\
"How are you doing Claire? It's Liam here," Liam Cunningham said. "I wish you the very best. I hope your days are not bad and I hope you can manage."\
The actors, submitting selfie videos in plain clothes, realized they might not be recognizable compared to their popular characters from the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.\
Staz Nair, who played Khaleesi's bodyguard, tried to describe himself as Qhono.\
"Imagine a beard. A beard, long hair and a horse," Nair said, laughing.\
"I just want to say thank you for watching. Thank you for being a fan," he said. "And I want to wish you a very smooth transition. I wish you all the best."\
\
Miltos Yerolemou, the First Sword of Braavos and Arya Stark's teacher, hoped the message made Claire smile.\
"I know you can't be here today, but I just wanted to say hello, and that you are with us in spirit and that we're thinking of you and sending you all our love," he said.\
Even "Nasty old Ser Meryn Trant," as Ian Beattie described his character, had a message.\
"I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful episode three, the Battle of Winterfell," Ian Beattie said. "I hear it's going to be the best episode ever."\
A spokesperson for HopeHealth told CNN they can only imagine what this meant to Walton.\
The episode aired on Sunday on HBO. Walton died Monday evening.\
New spaceflight technologies could reshape the global economy on a level not seen since the internet.\
\
That's what some in the industry and on Wall Street are saying, at least. And a growing number of analysts say it's time for mainstream investors to get in on the action.\
We're entering a new era in which the private sector is offering cheap and reliable access to space. That could pave the way for wild new businesses like in-orbit hotels or asteroid mining. New satellite and rocket technologies could also shake up a broad range of industries, from air travel to broadband service and data storage.\
"Costs are coming down and technology is improving," said Laura Kane, a long-term investing analyst at UBS. We're "getting beyond the realm of science fiction fans and thinking about where returns can be had."\
The space economy is following the roadmap of the internet revolution: Just like in the early dot-com days, flashy Silicon Valley types and a wellspring of venture capital money are pushing the envelope. The most high profile names are billionaire-backed startups, like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.\

It's too soon to tell which firms might be the Google or Facebook of the space industry, Kane said. But smart mainstream investors don't need to know that for sure.\
"I wouldn't only look at new emerging private companies," Kane added. "I'd also be looking at communications services companies. Maybe they're creating more advanced satellites, or looking at aerospace and defense companies that may be investing in new space technologies."\
In other words, stock market investors can put together diverse portfolios of space-related companies that will benefit from a new space age \'97 and then hang on for the long haul, Kane said.\
A bird's-eye look at the space industry\
The global space industry is currently valued at about $340 billion. Top financial institutions, from Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley, predict it will grow to $1 trillion or more over the next two decades.\
Hip new rocket companies are the most visible leaders in space, but launch services actually account for only a small fraction of the overall industry's revenue. Ground equipment and satellite services \'97 like space-based television, broadband and Earth observation \'97 are much larger businesses. Analysts say plans to beam cheap, high-speed internet from space will change the global economy.\

Investors who aren't sure where to start could check out an index or the first-ever ETF, or exchange-traded fund, that is focused solely on giving investors broad exposure to the booming space economy, according to its developers.\
The ETF began trading on the NYSE Arca exchange this month with the ticker UFO (UFO). It's based on the S-Network Space Index, which debuted last year, and includes a diverse blend of about 30 companies. They include telecom and satellite companies from AT&T (T) to Iridium (IRDM), along with old-school space and defense contractors, like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA) and engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD).\
CNN is a unit of WarnerMedia, which is owned by AT&T.\
Micah Walter-Range, who developed the index, is an industry expert who said he left the Space Foundation, a space industry-focused nonprofit, to figure out "how regular people like me can invest in space."\
The central idea: Investors don't need to invest directly in young startups because there is no clear divide between "new space" and "old space" companies, Walter-Range told CNN Business.\

The entire industry exists in a feedback loop. Many old-guard companies are investing in next-generation ideas to stay competitive. SpaceX's rockets frequently deploy satellites built by its competitors. And Blue Origin also has a deal to sell its rocket engines to United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Lockheed's joint venture.\
The interplay between companies in the space community mean they all stand to benefit from new technologies.\
